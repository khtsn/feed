The National Weather Service issued a rare flash flood emergency during the worst part of the storm, describing it as a “particularly dangerous situation.”</p><p>The same storm system dumped nearly 10 inches of rain in some areas of Connecticut on Sunday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/nyregion/connecticut-flooding-southbury.html" title="">causing rivers to crest their banks</a> and leading to another flash flood emergency declaration and about 100 evacuations, officials said. And in New York City, the downpour disrupted trains and forced the authorities to ground or cancel flights.</p><p>On Monday, more than 900,000 people in Suffolk County on Long Island were under a flash flood emergency that expired before dawn, <a href="https://x.com/NWSNewYorkNY/status/1825403430300778707" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the National Weather Service</a>. A flash flood emergency is the highest level of flood warning. </p><p>Brian Ciemnecki, a meteorologist with the Weather Service in New York, said that it was rare to issue such an alert for the area and that weather officials made the call after receiving numerous reports of water rescues and other damage caused by the storm.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The rain in most parts of Long Island had stopped by early Monday, he said, but issues were expected to carry over into the morning commute.</p><p>“If you’re traveling, I would expect, probably encounter some potential road closures just in the residual, leftover, flooding that occurred, especially in the northern half of the island,” Mr. Ciemnecki said.</p><p>A flash flood warning expired at 6:30 a.m. for eastern Suffolk County. The agency <a href="https://x.com/NWSNewYorkNY/status/1825383831647797580" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> early Monday that several inches of rain had fallen, and that multiple rescues were ongoing in the Nesconset, Ronkonkoma, Smithtown and St. James areas on Long Island.</p><p>The Suffolk County Police Department received dozens of calls overnight, including from drivers stranded in floodwaters and residents whose basements and first floors had been inundated, a police spokesman said. He added that the police had not received any reports of injuries.</p><p>The flooding also forced the closure of parts of some major highways and the suspension of some train service. That threatened to disrupt the morning commute.</p></div></div><div><div><p>A portion of the Long Island Expressway, the major roadway connecting Long Island to New York City, was briefly closed for a two-mile stretch in both directions near the Dix Hills early Monday, according to New York State authorities. New York State Route 25 was also closed in both directions near Dix Hills.</p><p>North of the city, the Bronx River Parkway was briefly closed for a two-mile stretch in both directions between the town of Scarsdale and the city of White Plains. Parts of the Harlem River Drive in Manhattan and the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx were blocked by flooding on Sunday, the police <a href="https://x.com/NYPDnews/status/1825358596349342135" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p><p>In Connecticut, <a href="https://new.mta.info/agency/metro-north-railroad" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Metro-North trains</a> on the Danbury and Waterbury branches of the New Haven line were suspended through Monday morning after flooding and a mudslide in the area, the M.T.A. said.</p><p>Flash flood emergencies or flash flood warnings were declared in Connecticut on Sunday for parts of Fairfield, New Haven, Litchfield and Hartford counties. In some places, the flooding was so severe that the police were unable to respond to calls because their cars were underwater and the roads were damaged.</p><p>At least 100 people were evacuated, Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/governor/news/press-releases/2024/08-2024/governor-lamont-statement-on-severe-flooding-impacting-portions-of-connecticut?language=en_US" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>.</p><p>Will Healey, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said in a statement that the agency had evacuated 43 campers and three D.E.E.P. staff members from Kettletown State Park, more than 20 miles northwest of New Haven, on Sunday after a nearby bridge was washed out.</p></div></div><div><p>“There were no reported injuries, though one person was transported via ambulance for evaluation for a medical issue,” he said.</p></div><div><div><p>One of the most dramatic scenes was at a flooded intersection in Southbury, where one man swam to a partially submerged car to rescue a driver, his prosthetic leg and his golden retriever.</p><p>The rescuer, Lucas Barber, said: “I pulled over, grabbed some rope that’s in the back of my car for emergencies, and threw my phone and wallet on the seat and ran out there.” Mr. Barber said he had checked the other nearby cars to ensure they were empty but had seen that Patrick Jennings, the man he rescued, was still inside his vehicle.</p><p>“He got me all the way out of the water, the dog comes swimming up and the rest is history,” Mr. Jennings said.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
