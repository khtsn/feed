    <h1>Riot announces Shanghai as host of Champions 2026</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
			<p>If matches start at 18:00 in Berlin, it&#39;s midnight in China and 1am in Korea. That&#39;s not really doable for East Asia.</p>
<p>And you don&#39;t really want to start matches much earlier than that because the majority of the event will be on regular business days.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not really possible to please all regions at once, and Pacific and China just have by far the bigges fanbase. Plus Champions is actually rotating through the regions (in the partnership era we&#39;ve had Americas, Pacific, EMEA, now China, and 2027 Americas again) so I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much to complain about.</p>
<p>Toronto and Paris this year should both be fine for Americas and tbh I&#39;m expecting M2 next year to be in EMEA again and M1 probably in Americas too.</p>		</div></div>
