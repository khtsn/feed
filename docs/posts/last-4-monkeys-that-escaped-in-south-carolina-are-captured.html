Alpha Genesis and the police did not immediately respond to an email and a phone call on Friday night seeking more information.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The rhesus macaques, which weigh <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/us/monkey-captured-south-carolina.html" title="">six to seven pounds</a>, are often used for experiments. Alpha Genesis cares for them and works with clients that are looking to do studies on primates, its website said.</p><p>After the 43 monkeys escaped, the surrounding community was told to not approach or attempt to interact with them and were instead advised to call the authorities. Traps baited with food were set and proved to be effective. Several of the monkeys were found in or near the traps, the police said.</p><p>Alpha Genesis reported that the monkeys that had been captured in mid-November were in good health. They ate peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and danced and ran around in the trees, the company said.</p><p>The rogue monkeys could be heard cooing to one another. But it was not the first time animals have escaped Alpha Genesis, which sits on about 100 acres and houses about 7,000 monkeys for scientific research. The Department of Agriculture fined the company more than $12,000 in 2017 in part because of failures to contain the animals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We’re not strangers to seeing monkeys randomly,” said David Paul Murray, a Yemassee Town Council member. “It’s something you don’t really think about until one runs across the road and you’re like, ‘Wait, what?’”</p><p>Teddy Rosenbluth<!-- --> and <!-- -->Sara Ruberg<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
