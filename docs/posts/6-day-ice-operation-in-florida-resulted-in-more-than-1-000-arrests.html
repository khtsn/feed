    <h1>6-Day ICE Operation in Florida Resulted in More Than 1,000 Arrests</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since January, the Trump administration has expanded the number of agreements it has with the local authorities to help with immigration enforcement. The Florida agencies involved in the six-day operation had signed such agreements as well. ICE has signed more than 400 agreements with local law enforcement since January, the agency said.</p><p>Those agreements are part of the 287(g) program, which allows local law enforcement to collaborate with federal officials on immigration enforcement.</p><p>Typically, in recent years, that meant local law enforcement helped ICE with migrants already detained in their local lockup. But lately the agency has given power to local law enforcement to make immigration arrests.</p><p>Austin Kocher, a research professor at Syracuse University who analyzes immigration data, said that ICE has signed over 200 agreements allowing local officers to make arrests since the beginning of the administration. ICE has long had the ability to pair up with the local authorities on operations, but the ability of local law enforcement to make arrests on their own would help the agency the most, he said.</p><p>Scott Shuchart, a former senior ICE official in the Biden administration, said the expansion of local law enforcement assisting ICE could help free up officers to handle other key parts of the deportation process, like working with representatives of other countries to obtain travel documents for removal and preparing flights. If it happens elsewhere, he said, it could expand ICEâ€™s ability to ramp up deportations.</p></div></div>
