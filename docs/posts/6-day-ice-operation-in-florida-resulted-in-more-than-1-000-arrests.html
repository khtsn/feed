Sheahan, the deputy director of ICE.</p><p>ICE officials said the operation targeted people with deportation orders and those with criminal histories. More than 60 percent of those picked up had either an arrest or a conviction, the agency said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Since January, the Trump administration has expanded the number of agreements it has with the local authorities to help with immigration enforcement. The Florida agencies involved in the six-day operation had signed such agreements as well. ICE has signed more than 400 agreements with local law enforcement since January, the agency said.</p><p>Those agreements are part of the 287(g) program, which allows local law enforcement to collaborate with federal officials on immigration enforcement.</p><p>Typically, in recent years, that meant local law enforcement helped ICE with migrants already detained in their local lockup. But lately the agency has given power to local law enforcement to make immigration arrests.</p><p>Austin Kocher, a research professor at Syracuse University who analyzes immigration data, said that ICE has signed over 200 agreements allowing local officers to make arrests since the beginning of the administration. ICE has long had the ability to pair up with the local authorities on operations, but the ability of local law enforcement to make arrests on their own would help the agency the most, he said.</p><p>Scott Shuchart, a former senior ICE official in the Biden administration, said the expansion of local law enforcement assisting ICE could help free up officers to handle other key parts of the deportation process, like working with representatives of other countries to obtain travel documents for removal and preparing flights. If it happens elsewhere, he said, it could expand ICE’s ability to ramp up deportations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Shuchart warned that the effort would be limited to areas willing to help ICE.</p><p>“It’s going to be very regional, though,” he said. “I expect most big cities outside Texas and Florida are going to want to keep their local tax revenue for things only local police can do and leave the immigration work to the feds.”</p><p>The program has faced pushback in the past. The <a href="https://www.aclu-wy.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/aclu_wy_letter_to_sheriffs_re_287g_agreements.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Civil Liberties Union wrote letters</a> this year to various local law enforcement officials advising them not to participate in such programs.</p><p>“They have a history of harming public safety, imposing serious financial burdens on localities and leading to civil rights violations,” one letter read.</p><p>In 2010, the inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security said that ICE and local law enforcement “were not operating in compliance with the terms of the agreements.”</p><p>By 2012, the Obama administration stopped signing agreements with local police that allowed them to help with immigration arrests and focused mostly on getting officers to help transfer migrants who were already in local lockups.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy for The Times.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Venezuelans Deported to El Salvador:</strong> New details deepen questions about the deportations, showing that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/us/politics/trump-deportations-venezuela-el-salvador.html">El Salvador’s president pressed for assurances</a> that the migrants were really members of the Tren de Aragua gang.</p></li><li><p><strong>Arresting Migrants Made Big Money:</strong> Kinney County, along Texas’ border with Mexico, collected some $1.7 million in bail from migrants who were deported before they could make their court appearances. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/migrants-border-bail-forfeit-kinney-county-texas.html">The money was never returned</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Deported Bhutanese Who Were Here Legally:</strong> Fear and confusion grip a community of Asian refugees as the Trump administration cracks down on immigration.
