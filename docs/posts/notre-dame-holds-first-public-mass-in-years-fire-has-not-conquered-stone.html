Nor — its millions of visitors a year notwithstanding — is it just a tourist attraction. Notre-Dame, as the crowds of stricken Parisians testified to on that April 2019 day, is the heart of their city, part of the essential fabric of its identity, and a part of them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Notre-Dame is, however, first and foremost a church, and on Sunday evening, worshipers returned there as its first regular Mass was celebrated below the soaring stone arches — the old ones indistinguishable from the new.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Seats for the Mass were in great demand.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Five years after its destruction, here it stands again, ready to welcome the prayers of the faithful, to welcome the heart, the cry of the heart of all those who come here from all over the world,” Msgr. Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, rector of the cathedral, declared in his opening remarks. “Fire has not conquered stone, despair has not conquered life.”</p><p>Packed into the pews and on newly carved oak chairs were 2,500 people. Some were members of the parish, others Catholics from across the city and country, and still others people who were simply curious to see with their own eyes what the years of renovation had produced. Some 2,000 workers labored to rebuild the cathedral, and more than $700 million out of the $900 million raised has been spent so far.</p><p>Most of the people attending the Mass secured their places on the cathedral’s <a href="https://resa.notredamedeparis.fr/fr/reservationindividuelle/tickets" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reservation website</a>, which ran out of seats within hours of going online last Tuesday. Many craned their necks up to stare in awe at the gleaming white limestone, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/europe/notre-dame-paris-france.html" title="">cleaned of dust</a> and centuries of accumulated grime, and at the glowing stained-glass windows, which were miraculously intact after the fire and also delicately cleaned.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Priests standing around an altar and parishioners in pews of a cathedral. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Perched above the doors, the 8,000-pipe great organ thundered with the notes of hymns. The organ had been spared in the fire, but each piece had to be carefully cleansed of lead dust, and much of it was shepherded to specialized workshops across France.</p><p>“She looks like an eternal young woman,” Patrick Renard, 59, his eyes shining, said of the cathedral as he roamed in an alley before the service.</p><p>Five years ago, Mr. Renard recalled, he was just stepping out of a movie theater when he got news of the fire. The movie, “By the Grace of God,” about sexual abuse in the church, had already broken his heart. So when he saw the flames rise, he said, “it was a double shock.”</p><p>Some of those who had visited Notre-Dame before the fire said they could barely recognize its interior.</p><p>“It’s the color that strikes me the most: I remembered it as gray,” said Constance Plessix, a 23-year-old engineering student who attended the Mass with her parents. “I know it’s stone, but it still looks like it’s shining,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A musician playing the organ of the restored Notre-Dame during the evening service.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Yet for all the novelty of setting foot in a cathedral remade, it was a day for ancient ritual. Worshipers held out their hands as they recited the “Our Father,” knelt as offerings were presented at the altar, and embraced one another as they shared the peace.</p><p>Near the end of the service, priests offered Communion from the new, 1,700-pound bronze altar, shaped like a parabola rising upward. It was designed by the French artist Guillaume Bardet, after the previous one was crushed by a fallen beam during the fire.</p><p>The altar had been consecrated earlier that morning by Laurent Ulrich, the archbishop of Paris, in a special Mass attended by bishops from across France, priests from around Paris and hundreds of their parishioners. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/world/europe/macron-france-government.html" title="">President Emmanuel Macron</a> sat in the front row with his wife, Brigitte.</p><p>To consecrate the altar, Archbishop Ulrich carried out a number of rites, starting by lowering a box of holy relics into its center with a metallic clang. The relics — small body parts of saints with ties to the church in Paris — will remain sealed there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Evening service at the restored cathedral.

Trump, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and Prince William of Britain.</p><p>But the Mass celebrated on Sunday evening, as the first public one, had a more intimate feel.</p><p>“This cathedral is the mother church of Paris, the church of all Parisians,” Monsignor Ribadeau Dumas said during the service. “It is for all. It’s a place of peace, a place of joy, a place of life.”</p><p>For those who regularly attended Mass at Notre-Dame before the fire, Sunday’s service had special meaning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p><strong>“</strong>This is our return to our church,” said Auxence Auclair, 24, a historian of ancient Greece, as he stood outside in the rain. “When you enter, you know where you are. You are happy.” The five longs years had been difficult for him. “I am a bit emotional,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People arriving at the cathedral on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Many were in tears of thanks to the firefighters who saved the cathedral from total devastation that night, and the workers, many with specialized skills, who managed to restore it to its original form.</p><p>“I came here to be in communion, and then to see everything that’s been done by the workers, by all the trades and crafts” said Cécile Salémi, 42, who traveled from Maine-et-Loire, where over the summer she visited one of the carpentry workshops working on the cathedral.</p><p>Though most came to pray, some simply came to see it.</p><p>“We didn’t even know there would be a Mass!” said Thomas Weinbeck, a land and environment manager from Bourgogne. His family had come to Paris to celebrate a friend’s birthday and had made it to the cathedral after visiting the city’s catacombs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“To be honest, I also came to pray a little, even though I don’t really believe in it,” said their friend, Annabelle Kaszynski. “There’s always hope that there may be someone up there, and this is not just any place, so maybe in here He’ll hear me.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Visitors admire at the restored cathedral during the evening service on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Even for those disinclined toward faith , the evening offered an important feeling.
