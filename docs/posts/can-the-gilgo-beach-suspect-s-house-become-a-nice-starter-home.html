Ms. Ellerup and the couple’s two adult children are relocating to a South Carolina property purchased years ago as a retirement home, and she will put the Long Island home up for sale after her divorce from Mr. Heuermann becomes final in about six months, their lawyers said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At once, talk of the house as a headquarters of horror shifted to its potential as a real estate parcel: speculation about price, banter about a bargain buy and the hope that a sale will end an ugly chapter for the neighborhood.</p><p>Mr. Heuermann had lived his entire life in the dilapidated ranch house with the unkempt yard on First Avenue, including the past three decades with his wife and two children.</p><p>From there, prosecutors say, he commuted into his architecture consultancy firm in Manhattan by day and, on some fateful nights, headed out to meet escorts, kill them and dump their bodies along a nearby oceanfront parkway and elsewhere.</p><p>In the basement, they say, Mr. Heuermann kept an arsenal and a manual of grisly methods on how to hunt and kill women.</p><p>Mr. Heuermann is charged in the killings of six women dating at least to 1993. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and has been held without bail at the Suffolk County jail in Riverhead since his arrest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Since his arrest in July 2023, Ms. Ellerup and their children have remained in the house, even as investigators rifled through it and removed evidence by the truckload.</p><p>Prosecutors do not consider Ms. Ellerup a suspect, nor the couple’s children, Victoria Heuermann, 28, and Christopher Sheridan, 35. The authorities have said they were away on trips when the killings happened.</p><p>Robert Macedonio, Ms. Ellerup’s lawyer, said the place had become a burden.</p><p>“People constantly stop in front of the house, to gawk and point and take pictures,” he said. “She’s lost any emotional attachment she had to the premises because of everything that’s gone on, and the only way she can start recovering is to move.”</p><p>Also, he said, the house’s interior was left in shambles by searches this year and last. Investigators cut up floors, removed plumbing and found a cache of more than 200 guns.</p><p>They dug up swaths of the backyard and removed furniture and bags of household possessions. The extensive damage to the interior was never properly repaired, Mr. Macedonio said. A bathtub was held together with duct tape.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“She has no money to repair it,” Mr. Macedonio said, adding that even Ms. Ellerup’s documentary payments were not enough.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The house turned a quiet section of Massapequa Park into a morbid tourist attraction.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Johnny Milano for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Notorious properties present unusual challenges for sellers, buyers and brokers. In 2011, in nearby East Meadow, the four-bedroom ranch where the serial killer Joel Rifkin grew up was sold by his family for $322,000, a $100,000 reduction from the initial asking price.</p><p>“I was able to negotiate because of the situation,” said Peter Hirschhorn, an agent with Coldwell Banker American Homes who represented the buyers, a young couple.</p><p>Mr. Rifkin, who admitted to killing 17 women, stored a victim’s body in the garage and may have murdered some victims there, too. It helped that he had been arrested 18 years earlier and sentenced to life in prison, Mr. Hirschhorn said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Before I showed my clients the property, I emailed them and said, ‘I want you to Google and do your research on the property, because unfortunate circumstances took place there that I want you to be aware of,’” he said. “They were fine with it. They said, ‘Yeah, we’re good.’ They fell in love with it and made it their own.”</p><p>Regarding the Massapequa Park house, he said, “I’d love to sell this home — it could be a nice starter home.”</p><p>But Louis Scrimenti, 39, an agent with Signature Premier Properties in Massapequa Park, said it would more likely be bought by a builder, perhaps for around $600,000, and replaced with something that could sell for at least $1.5 million.</p><p>“I don’t think a regular consumer would buy that home,” he said. “I’d say nine out of 10 consumers would be turned off by it.”</p><p>The sellers may be motivated. Vess Mitev, a lawyer for the children, said that moving would help them start “the next chapter of their lives,” somewhere “farther away from the spotlight, and farther away from this dark cloud that hangs over their heads.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Before her father’s arrest, Victoria worked for his Manhattan firm, which has since been closed. She has had trouble getting a job, Mr. Mitev said. As for the son, he said: “Chris can’t even walk his dog down the block. He gets photographed, people stop and take pictures, he’s catcalled, the whole thing.”</p><p>“They can’t even check the mail,” he said. “That kind of scrutiny is not for my clients. They never asked for it.”</p><p>The Massapequa Park house became a daily encampment for news crews and a tourist attraction for true crime fans. The authorities sealed off the block for nearly two weeks. Neighbors weary of being interviewed still have “No Soliciting” signs on their front doors.</p><p>Days after Mr. Heuermann’s arrest, Ms. Ellerup filed for divorce after 27 years of marriage, but she continued to call and visit him in jail and attend his court hearings, often with cameras in tow from her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/28/nyregion/gilgo-beach-wife-documentary.html" title="">Peacock documentary deal, reportedly worth $1 million</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Mr. Macedonio said the house cannot be listed and sold until after the divorce. He said that Ms. Ellerup, despite relocating, still plans to attend the trial, which will most likely be next year, and “still has the same opinion: She doesn’t believe he’s capable of what he’s been accused of.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Investigators spent days disassembling the home, looking for evidence of serial murders.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Johnny Milano for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Heuermann’s family had made themselves scarce during the searches, but surprised onlookers by moving back into the house despite its interior being in shambles. The family was left to sleep on mats, Mr. Macedonio said. They cooked on a grill in the front yard, defying news crews and curious visitors.</p><p>Some neighbors had hoped that the village might buy the property to prevent anyone else from living there.</p><p>As for Mr. Cella, the neighbor, he got used to saying hello to Mr. Heuermann’s son when he saw him walking his therapy dog, Stewie. But still, he added, it is probably time for the family and the neighborhood to turn the page, “so that years from now, people won’t still be gawking and staring.”</p><p>“All neighborhoods heal,” he said. “Eventually.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Corey Kilgannon is a Times reporter who writes about crime and criminal justice in and around New York City, as well as breaking news and other feature stories.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/corey-kilgannon">More about Corey Kilgannon</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
