The president’s address to Parliament, his first so far this year, was seen by many Ukrainians as an attempt to sell his message at home and reassure a nation where war fatigue is on the rise.</p><p>The proposal, which Mr. Zelensky has called a “victory plan,” aims to strengthen Ukraine’s position enough on the battlefield to force Russia to negotiate an end to the war. Much of that would hinge on increased Western support. </p><p>“If we start moving forward with this victory plan now, we may be able to end the war no later than next year,” Mr. Zelensky said in his speech on Wednesday, which was broadcast on television.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“This plan can be implemented,” he added. “It depends on our partners. I emphasize: on partners.”</p><p>But whether Kyiv’s allies will endorse the plan remains to be seen. Mr. Zelensky recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/us/politics/biden-zelensky-weapons-aid-ukraine.html" title="">visited Washington</a> and European capitals to brief Ukraine’s allies on the strategy, and the responses have been limited. Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, raised questions about the proposal, noting that it repeats some of Ukraine’s earlier calls for increased military aid.</p><p>Given the context, experts said, Mr. Zelensky’s speech seemed primarily aimed at rallying support from the Ukrainian public for the plan’s potential to turn the tide on the battlefield. Since the start of the year, Ukrainian forces have been steadily losing ground to Russian troops, dampening the mood in the country.</p><p>“It’s necessary to boost the Ukrainian morale today,” Olexiy Haran, a professor of comparative politics at the National University of Kyiv — Mohyla Academy, said in an interview. “This speech is meant to send a political and psychological message to the Ukrainians.”</p><p>Daria Mitiuk<!-- --> contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
