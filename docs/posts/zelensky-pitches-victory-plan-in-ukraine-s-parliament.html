The president’s address to Parliament, his first so far this year, was seen by many Ukrainians as an attempt to sell his message at home and reassure a nation where war fatigue is on the rise amid steady Russian advances.</p><p>The proposal, which Mr. Zelensky has called a “victory plan,” aims to strengthen Ukraine’s position enough on the battlefield to force Russia to negotiate an end to the war. Much of that would hinge on increased Western support.</p><p>“If we start moving forward with this victory plan now, we may be able to end the war no later than next year,” Mr. Zelensky said in his <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/news/haj-nasha-spilna-robota-za-planom-peremogi-yaknajshvidshe-ob-93849" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">speech</a> on Wednesday, which was also broadcast on television.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“This plan can be implemented,” he added. “It depends on our partners. I emphasize: on partners.”</p><p>But whether Kyiv’s allies will endorse the plan remains to be seen. Mr. Zelensky recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/us/politics/biden-zelensky-weapons-aid-ukraine.html" title="">visited Washington</a> and European capitals to brief Ukraine’s allies on the strategy, and the responses have been limited. Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, raised questions about the plan, noting that it repeats some of Ukraine’s earlier calls for increased military aid.</p><p>NATO defense ministers will discuss Mr. Zelensky’s plan during two days of talks that begin on Thursday, the military alliance’s new secretary general, Mark Rutte, said at a news conference on Wednesday. “It will no doubt be on the table,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Rutte would not comment on the specifics of the proposal, or on Mr. Zelensky’s desire to be offered a formal invitation to join NATO, even if the conflict with Russia makes that currently impractical. He said that Ukraine would one day join the alliance, but that the defense ministers would concentrate on providing up to 40 billion euros in military support for Ukraine as promised at their last summit meeting.</p><p>Given the context, experts said, Mr. Zelensky’s speech seemed primarily aimed at reassuring and rallying support from the Ukrainian public around the idea that Kyiv can turn the tide on the battlefield after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-kursk.html" title="">steadily losing ground to Russian troops</a> this year. In recent weeks, Russian forces have been closing in on the northeastern city of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/11/world/europe/kupiansk-ukraine-russia-occupation.html" title="">Kupiansk</a>, prompting the Ukrainian authorities there to <a href="https://kharkivoda.gov.ua/news/128794" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">order</a> a mandatory evacuation on Tuesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The funeral of Anatoliy Vostrikov, a Ukrainian soldier, last month.

And sentiment in some cases has shifted from an unwavering resolve for total and outright victory to a more conciliatory stance.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng&amp;cat=reports&amp;id=1422&amp;page=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> released in August by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that 57 percent of Ukrainians believe that Kyiv should engage in peace negotiations with Moscow.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky cast his plan as a “bridge” to a future peace settlement, saying on Wednesday that the goal was to make it impossible for Russia “to continue the war,” so that Moscow felt pressured to come to the negotiating table.</p><p>The plan would require allies to extend an invitation to join NATO, lift the restrictions that bar Kyiv from using Western-provided weapons to strike inside Russia, and establish joint weapons production with Ukraine — all asks previously made by Mr. Zelensky’s government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>On Wednesday, the Ukrainian leader also said he wanted Ukraine’s neighbors to help shoot down Russian missiles and drones from their own territory, an idea that some allies have rejected in the past.</p><p>He framed the plan as mutually beneficial for Ukraine and the allies upon whose backing it would require. He noted that Ukraine had rich metal resources that its partners could use and suggested that Kyiv’s military could play a crucial role in protecting the West from further Russian aggression.</p><p>The lawmakers, government ministers and military leaders in attendance gave Mr. Zelensky a standing ovation when he emphasized that “trading Ukraine’s territory or sovereignty” was not part of the plan.</p><p>But opposition lawmakers were quick to express skepticism after the address. Oleksiy Honcharenko, a member of European Solidarity, the party of Mr. Zelensky’s chief rival, <a href="https://t.me/oleksiihoncharenko/43949" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called</a> the plan “very unrealistic.” He noted that it depended heavily on Western assistance yet did not outline what Ukraine could do on its own to improve the situation.</p><p>“According to the plan, it seems that someone has to do everything for us,” Mr. Honcharenko <a href="https://t.me/oleksiihoncharenko/43949" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Some Kyiv residents were similarly unconvinced.</p><p>“The victory plan sounds great. Very glossy. But whether anyone will actually do something and how Russia will react — it’s unclear,” said Anton Sokol, 25, who was reading about the speech on his phone.</p><p>“It sounds great, but also unrealistic,” Mr. Sokol added.</p><p>Yehor Kuryschenko, 28, said the plan sounded more like a collated list of demands for Ukraine’s partners than a strategy to win the war.</p><p>“There’s nothing fundamentally new,” he said. “It’s just putting everything into one request with an emphasis on swift and decisive action.”</p><p>Daria Mitiuk<!-- --> contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine, and <!-- -->Steven Erlanger<!-- --> from Berlin.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
