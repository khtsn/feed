In the order he called on Vice President JD Vance, who is a member of the Smithsonian’s board, to work with Congress to prohibit expenditures on exhibitions or programs that “degrade shared American values, divide Americans by race or promote ideologies inconsistent with federal law.” His executive order also called for making sure that the Smithsonian’s American Women’s History Museum, which is under development, does not “recognize men as women in any respect.”</p><p>The Smithsonian, which has 21 museums, libraries, research centers and the National Zoo, appeared to be caught off-guard by the order. When contacted by a reporter shortly after it was released on Thursday evening, several leaders said they were just learning about the new order themselves. The announcement recalled Mr. Trump’s takeover of the Kennedy Center <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/trump-kennedy-center.html?" title="">last month</a>, when he purged Biden appointees from the formerly bipartisan board and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/arts/music/trump-kennedy-center-chairman.html" title="">installed himself</a> as its chairman.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A spokeswoman for the Smithsonian declined to comment. The institution had closed its diversity office shortly after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/arts/design/smithsonian-diversity-office-trump.html" title="">president signed</a> a January executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs at organizations receiving federal money. The Smithsonian receives nearly two-thirds of its $1 billion budget from the federal government, as appropriated by Congress.</p><p>In another passage of the order that could have sweeping implications, Mr. Trump directed the secretary of the Department of the Interior, which oversees the National Park Service, to determine whether, since 2020, “public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior’s jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history.”</p><p>Instead, the order directs, all properties should “focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people or, with respect to natural features, the beauty, abundance, and grandeur of the American landscape.”</p><p>In recent years, many park service sites have updated their interpretive materials to take account of subjects like slavery and the appropriation of Native American lands. Others have sought to tell broader, more complex stories about the founders and other leaders.</p><p>A planned <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/lincoln-memorial-new-underground-museum-2026-180981736/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$69 million renovation</a> of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall includes a new underground museum that aims to tell a broader story about the memorial, including its role as a site for civil rights demonstrations like the 1963 March on Washington. A renovation of the nearby Jefferson Memorial will provide “more perspectives on Thomas Jefferson’s multifaceted story,” according to the parks service.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Douglas Brinkley, a historian at Rice University who has written frequently about the National Park Service, said that federal help with deferred maintenance at many sites is much needed, and welcome. But he said that interference with labels and interpretive material — such as the <a href="https://www.npca.org/articles/7142-parks-group-condemns-erasure-of-lgbtq-history-from-park-service-website" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent deletion</a> of material relating to the history of L.G.B.T.Q. protest at Independence Hall from the park service’s website — was troubling.</p><p>“The idea of rewriting storyboards or doing away with any monuments is anti-American in spirit,” he said. “Each of these sites has been curated over decades.”</p><p>Mr. Trump has broad authority over the Department of the Interior, a part of the executive branch. But the president’s efforts to control the Smithsonian, which is in the middle of <a href="https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/releases/smithsonian-launches-biggest-fundraising-campaign-its-178-year-history" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a $2.5 billion capital drive</a>, are more complicated.</p><p>The Smithsonian’s Board of Regents includes a mixture of Democrats and Republicans, and is overseen by Congress. The vice president and chief justice of the Supreme Court are members by virtue of their office. Three members are appointed by the House of Representatives and three by the Senate, with the remaining nine nominated by the board and appointed for a six-year term by a joint resolution, signed by the president, according to the institution’s <a href="https://www.si.edu/regents/members" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>. The current chairwoman is Risa J. Lavizzo-Mourey, a geriatrician and health policy expert.</p><p>The current secretary of the Smithsonian, Lonnie G. Bunch III, was the founding director of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture. He has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/business/smithsonian-lonnie-bunch-corner-office.html" title="">forcefully advocated</a> for what he describes as “nuance and complexity” in history, and warned of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/20/opinions/civil-rights-act-1964-anniversary-racism-bunch/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">continuing backlash</a> against civil rights progress.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s order criticized the African American Museum, saying it had “proclaimed that ‘hard work,’ ‘individualism,’ and ‘the nuclear family’ are aspects of ‘White culture.’” In 2020, the museum did include a worksheet with those claims as part of a new Talking About Race online portal. But after it <a href="https://x.com/ByronYork/status/1283372233730203651" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drew criticism</a>, Mr. Bunch ordered it removed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I think the document itself was wrong and flawed,” he told a Congressional oversight committee in 2023. “I do think, however, it’s important for the Smithsonian to help the country grapple with questions of race, so I’m not going to run away from that. But I agree with you very much that that document is not the kind of document that should be at the Smithsonian.”</p><p>In the executive order, Mr. Trump claimed that the American Women’s History Museum, which is under development, “plans to celebrate male athletes participating in women’s sports.” The museum’s collections and digital exhibits include material about trans women, including the activist <a href="https://womenshistory.si.edu/herstory/activism/object/sylvia-rivera" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sylvia Rivera</a>, who helped lead the 1969 Stonewall rebellion, and the <a href="https://womenshistory.si.edu/object/nmah_1918277" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">professional skateboarder</a> Cher Strauberry, who donated one of her skate decks to the museum. But leaders have not released plans for the physical museum, which is still seeking a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/arts/smithsonian-museums-latinos-women.html" title="">permanent space</a> on the National Mall.</p><p>Laura Raicovich, a former museum executive who wrote <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/products/2560-culture-strike?srsltid=AfmBOor__fFxFS8IHXz4OgaBLG6rdczphbaGB5Tt874VotoJ6cTtImsS" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a book</a> on the relationship between art, protest and politics, said that the new executive order was a powerful lesson in how governments seek to shape history.</p><p>“The order itself is a clear example of the weaponization of language by the administration to undo the necessary historical correctives undertaken by knowledge institutions in recent years,” she said.</p><p>Some historians are defending the Smithsonian, which is not just a public museum but also a highly respected research institution. James Grossman, the executive director of the American Historical Association, the country’s largest group of professional historians, said the fact sheet accompanying the order “egregiously misrepresents the work of the Smithsonian.”</p><p>“The historical scholarship in the Smithsonian is careful, honest and based on historical evidence,” he said. “Historians draw on that evidence to understand how our nation has evolved. That evolution includes elements that should make us proud. But also elements that we should not be proud of, but from which we should learn.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The new executive order follows several others early in Mr. Trump’s second term that focus on promoting what Mr. Trump terms “patriotic history,” which he has said should be emphasized during the run-up to the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in July 2026. The order also specifies that the federal government provide funding for the continuing restoration of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where the declaration was signed.</p><p>Last month, Mr. Trump issued an executive order re-establishing his 1776 Commission, which was disbanded by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in January 2021, days after issuing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/us/politics/trump-1776-commission-report.html" title="">a sweeping report</a> blasting liberal accounts of American history.
