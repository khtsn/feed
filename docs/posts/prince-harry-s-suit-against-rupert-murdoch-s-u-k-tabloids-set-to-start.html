Lawyers for Harry, 40, the younger son of King Charles III, will set out to show that the News Group executives concealed and sought to destroy evidence of hacking and other improper practices.</p><p>Harry is one of only two plaintiffs left from an original group of about 40; the rest, including the actor Hugh Grant, have settled with News Group. The other plaintiff, who is also scheduled to take the stand, is Tom Watson, a former deputy leader of the Labour Party, who alleges that News Group hacked his phone and targeted him for political reasons.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Harry has so far refused to settle, casting his suit as a last chance to hold the British press to account for one of its darkest periods. In addition to hacking phones, the tabloids hired private detectives and encouraged journalists to lie and misrepresent themselves to gain access to highly personal data.</p><p>“One of the main reasons for seeing this through is accountability, because I am the last person that can actually achieve that,” Harry said last month in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/podcasts/prince-harry-on-his-murdoch-tabloid-fight-and-big-tech.html" title="">interview</a> at The New York Times’s DealBook Summit.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
