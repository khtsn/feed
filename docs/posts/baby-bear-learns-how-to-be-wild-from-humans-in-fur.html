He could fit in your two palms — just three pounds.”</p><p>He has been thriving — playing, climbing, exploring — in the center’s care and now weighs more than 12 pounds.</p><p>“He’s doing all the things on his own, and not looking for us, not relying on us,” Ms. Welch said. “It’s a good feeling to see that he is very well-adjusted.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aishvarya Kavi works in the Washington bureau of The Times, helping to cover a variety of political and national news.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
