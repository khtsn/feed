Led by the group <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-hts-who-what.html" title="">Hayat Tahrir al-Sham</a>, they now control all of Idlib Province and most of Aleppo Province. That includes much of the city of Aleppo, one of Syria’s largest and the economic heart of the country. Now the rebels have set their sights on Hama, which has been a focal point of past revolts brutally suppressed by the country’s rulers.</p><p>On Wednesday, the rebel command said that its fighters had captured several towns and villages just outside the city of Hama, the regional capital, as well as a Syrian military base on its outskirts. That came hours after the rebels said that their fighters had control of Al-Mujanzarat Military Academy, one of the government’s largest bases, east of the city. Neither side’s claims could be independently verified.</p><p>Hama’s history would make it a substantial and symbolic prize for the rebels. The city was the site of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/03/opinion/the-new-hama-rules.html" title="">a massacre in 1982</a>, when government forces under the rule of Mr. al-Assad’s father, President Hafez al-Assad, moved to crush an Islamist-led revolt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Up to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/on-30th-anniversary-of-hama-massacre-syrian-troops-lock-down-city/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">30,000 people were killed</a> when the elder Mr. al-Assad sent troops into the city in a 27-day assault, though the total death toll was never confirmed. That was the last time Syrians rose up against their autocratic leader, until 2011, when widespread antigovernment protests — including in Hama — drew a forceful crackdown from Bashar al-Assad, igniting the current civil war.</p><p>Until last week, the Syrian civil war had been largely frozen in place since 2020. Now, the formerly static map of rebel- and government-held territory is shifting quickly as each side advances and retreats around Hama.</p><p>Syria’s state news agency reported on Tuesday that a large number of reinforcements had arrived in Hama to help repel the rebels. The director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said in an interview with French television on Wednesday that government artillery and airstrikes had managed to push the rebels back from the city.</p><p>At the same time, Syrian warplanes were striking rebel-held territory. A photojournalist working for the German news agency DPA, Anas Al-Kharboutli, was killed in an airstrike in the countryside north of Hama on Wednesday morning, according to <a href="https://www.presseportal.de/pm/8218/5923395" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> from the company.</p><p>Russia, a key ally of Mr. al-Assad, has been assisting Syria’s military with airstrikes to try to halt the rebels’ advance. On Wednesday, the Syrian military said that Russia had helped secure safe passage for government forces who had been besieged at the Assad Military Engineering Academy in Aleppo.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It said in a statement that “joint Syrian-Russian military-political coordination” had helped lift the rebel siege, but did not specify whether Moscow had intervened on the ground or mediated the troops’ exit.</p><p>There was no immediate comment from the Russian Defense Ministry about the events at the academy, and it was unclear whether the academy was now fully under rebel control.</p><p>Moscow did reiterate on Wednesday its continued solidarity with Mr. al-Assad.</p><p>“We strongly support the efforts of the Syrian authorities to counter terrorist groups and restore constitutional order,” Maria V. Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said in a statement, echoing Mr. al-Assad’s longtime contention that the Syrian rebels were terrorists.</p><p>Muhammad Haj Kadour<!-- -->, <!-- -->Jacob Roubai<!-- --> and <!-- -->Rania Khaled<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vivian Yee is a Times reporter covering North Africa and the broader Middle East.
