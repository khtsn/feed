But the branch of the agency that funds STEM education research is taking a disproportionate hit.</p><p>STEM education research focuses on improving how students, from preschool to university, are trained in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. That encompasses everything from adopting better curriculums and teaching methods to changing the way schools and districts are run. Researchers say that the values encapsulated in diversity, equity and inclusion, or D.E.I., have been a focus in the field since long before the terms were strung into an acronym and popularized.</p><p>“The work of STEM education has always been about creating a bigger tent, giving access to more students of all backgrounds so that our STEM work force better reflects the diversity and demographics of the American public,” said Mike Steele, a math education researcher at Ball State University and a former program officer in the National Science Foundation’s directorate of STEM education.</p><p>More than 1,400 research grants at the foundation have been canceled since April, according to <a href="https://grant-watch.us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grant Watch</a>, a crowdsourced online database. <a href="https://grant-watch.us/nsf-summary-2025-05-07.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">As of May 7</a>, awards for STEM education accounted for 54 percent of those terminations, a loss of $773 million in funding, which represents nearly three-fourths of the total dollar amount of terminated foundation grants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>One canceled project aimed to use virtual reality to better engage high school students with autism in engineering. Another created hands-on programs for Indigenous youth to grow food using traditional knowledge and modern technology. A third intended to double the number of rural students earning associate’s and bachelor’s degrees in STEM across the Black Belt of Alabama.</p><p>Experts in the field saw the grant cancellations as part of a broader attack on education, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as well as on D.E.I.</a>, by the Trump administration.</p><p>“It was a gut punch,” said Julie Posselt, an associate dean of the graduate school at the University of Southern California, and a “pretty profound confirmation” that the cuts were not about science writ large. “It’s about the association of educational research with interests and values that are at odds with the administration’s priorities.”</p><p>Dr. Posselt was a member of an advisory committee, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/about/performance/advisory-committees" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dissolved in April</a>, for the foundation’s education directorate. This month, two of her grants from the agency, both supporting research on STEM graduate education, were cut.</p><p>“De-prioritizing STEM education is just a slightly delayed way of de-prioritizing STEM,” said Joe Champion, a math education researcher at Boise State University. He noted that it often took a decade or more of training for scientists to meaningfully contribute to cutting-edge programs. “Reducing the quality of the training can’t possibly be good for society,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On May 9, the foundation announced that it was “sunsetting” its division of equity for excellence in STEM, part of the agency’s <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/edu" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">directorate for STEM education</a>, “to ensure our efforts align with our priorities,” according to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250512060132/https://www.nsf.gov/edu" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on the agency’s website. (The foundation suspended this decision on May 12 in compliance with a <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69961059/85/american-federation-of-government-employees-afl-cio-v-trump/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">temporary restraining order</a>, according to internal records reviewed by The New York Times.)</p><p>The move follows <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/science/trump-dei-science.html" title="">previous</a> <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/updates-on-priorities" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">actions</a> by the foundation to comply with an executive order issued by President Trump in January, which called for the elimination of D.E.I. across the federal government. A spokesman for the agency declined to comment on the grant terminations or the decision to close the division of equity for excellence in STEM.</p><p>The federal government has worked to broaden participation of people from underrepresented groups in STEM since at least 1980, when Congress enacted the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/96th-congress/senate-bill/568" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Science and Technology Equal Opportunities Act</a>. The mandate authorized the foundation to support educational efforts to increase the number of women and racial minorities in STEM. In 2010, the <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:42%20section:1862p-14%20edition:prelim)" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">America COMPETES Reauthorization Act</a> required the agency to include the increased participation of marginalized groups in STEM as part of its criteria for funding research.</p><p>The agency began to adopt D.E.I. language more explicitly during the Biden administration. “It was an emerging priority,” said Adrienne Dixson, an education researcher at Pennsylvania State University.</p><p>Dr. Dixson was hired by the foundation in 2021 to help run its new <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/edu-racial-equity-racial-equity-stem-education/506103/nsf22-634" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">racial equity in STEM education</a> program. In 2022, the foundation hired its first chief diversity officer and renamed its education directorate, as well as the division of equity for excellence in STEM, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/nsf-announces-name-changes-education-directorate" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to “more accurately reflect and communicate” its values</a>, including diversity and inclusion in STEM.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But when Mr. Trump took office this year, the foundation began a review of current awards containing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/07/us/trump-federal-agencies-websites-words-dei.html" title="">buzzwords commonly associated with D.E.I.</a> In April, the agency <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/updates-on-priorities" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> that projects relying on “D.E.I. frameworks or advocacy” did not represent its priorities, and the grant terminations began.</p><p>The defunding comes amid broader shifts in education. That includes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/education-department-cuts.html" title="">mass layoffs and hundreds of millions of dollars in cuts</a> to various components of the Department of Education, which Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/trump-education-department.html" title="">has tried to eliminate altogether</a>.</p><p>“The broader attack here is on evidence,” said William Penuel, an education researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder. “Without evidence, anyone can make up a story about how schools are doing and what they need to do.”</p><p>One potential outcome of defunding a large portion of STEM education research is that the work may become more concentrated at larger universities that are able to provide alternative sources of funding.</p><p>That’s unfortunate, Dr. Champion said, as STEM education is often tailored to local and state-level priorities. “When the research is done by just a few people in localized parts of the country, everyone else is tapping into incomplete information about what’s the best way to teach and to learn, and what are the most effective materials to use,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Researchers funded outside of the foundation’s STEM education directorate — in physics, engineering, geoscience and more — face less extreme cuts. But they, too, are concerned about the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01098-9" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">financial support</a> and educational preparation of students in STEM, many of whom would lead the next generation of scientific discoveries.</p><p>“STEM and STEM education research need to grow hand in hand,” Dr. Penuel said. “And if we stop funding education research, they won’t.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Katrina Miller is a science reporter for The Times based in Chicago.
