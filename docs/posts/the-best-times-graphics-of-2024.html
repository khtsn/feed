When he won gold for the United States in the 100-meter race at the Olympics this summer, he got off to a slow start. During the first 40 meters, he trailed the pack. Only in the final stride did he pull ahead, winning by a fraction of a second.</p><p>The margin of his victory was imperceptible to the human eye. So journalists at The New York Times took photographs at 100-millisecond intervals and calculated his speed using a computational technology known as computer vision. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/04/sports/olympics/mens-100-noah-lyles-kishane-thompson.html" title="">You can see the results here</a>.</p><p>At The Times, visual journalists are always on the prowl for innovative ways to tell big news stories. Our teams broke down major events by the second (and by the fraction of a second) and mapped data at the neighborhood level. We produced interactive features that helped readers personalize, explore and investigate patterns in the news for themselves.</p><p>Here are some standout moments from the year:</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><ul><li><p>In June, New York’s governor nixed a plan to toll cars entering certain parts of Manhattan. “Congestion pricing,” as the proposal is called, would have paid for subway upgrades. (A more modest version is now set to begin in January.) To see how much money the original plan might have collected from drivers, we sent 27 colleagues to the edges of tolling zones to count vehicles during the morning rush hour. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/01/upshot/congestion-pricing.html" title="">Here’s what we found</a>.</p></li><li><p>In March, a container ship struck the Key Bridge in Baltimore, causing its collapse. We used shipping traffic data, satellite imagery and a federal inventory of bridges to identify <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/06/us/bridge-collapse-protections-baltimore.html" title="">over 190 vulnerable bridges across the country</a> that also lack the protections they need.</p></li><li><p>Fatal shootings surged during the pandemic, and they spread into new places. To find out where, we plotted every gun homicide that took place during the pandemic years on a map alongside demographic data. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/14/us/gun-homicides-map.html" title="">Click here to explore gun violence in your own neighborhood</a>.</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><ul><li><p>A.I.-generated content is becoming harder to detect. As A.I. companies trawl the web for new data to train their upgrades, it is more likely that they will ingest A.I.-generated content. What would it look like if a model is trained on its own output? To find out, we showed handwritten numbers to an A.I. and asked it to mimic those digits. Then we fed the result back into the system, over and over again.

We worked with an A.I. company to scan satellite images for these new settlements, and then verified the results by looking at historical photos, state media, public records and social media posts. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/10/world/asia/china-border-villages.html?unlocked_article_code=1.ik4._utD.yUsYq6VKQBkC" title="">You can see here</a> what they look like and where they are.</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><ul><li><p>After the Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion in 2022, more than a dozen states banned the practice. Suddenly, women seeking an abortion often had to travel out of state.

Those regions are also more prone to extreme weather events — fires, hurricanes, floods.
