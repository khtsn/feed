    <h1>KRÜ and G2 remain undefeated in week 3 of Americas</h1>

			<p>No it doesn&#39;t - if KRU beats EG next week, but 100T beats both 2G and KRU in the next two weeks, then both KRU and 100T would have a 4-1 record.</p>
<p>In this case, we would use the tie-breaker rule for a 2-way tie, which is Regular Season Head-to-Head. Because KRU would have lost to 100T in the regular season, 100T would win the tiebreaker, and finish first in the group.</p>
<p>EDIT: to provide additional clarity, if KRU loses to EG in Week 4 but beats 100T in Week 5, then they will be 1st seed going into playoffs. This is because, assuming SEN also goes 2-0 in the next two weeks, both KRU and SEN would have a record of 4-1. If we use the 2-way tiebreaker rules again, we would find the head-to-head between KRU and SEN, and since KRU beat SEN last week, they have the advantage.</p>		</div></div>
