Mr. Waltz had seemingly inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/war-plans-signal-chat-what-to-know.html" title="">a sensitive group chat</a> on Signal, a commercial messaging app, ahead of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/us/politics/us-attack-houthis.html" title="">U.S. strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthi militia</a> in Yemen on March 15.</p><p>The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/29/us/politics/trump-signal-michael-waltz.html" title="">reported on Saturday that Mr. Trump</a> had spent much of the week consulting with aides about whether he should fire Mr. Waltz amid mounting fallout from the episode.</p><p>But Mr. Trump told Ms. Welker that he still had confidence in Mr. Waltz and in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and he continued to downplay the seriousness of the incident. “I don’t fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump also discussed Greenland, a day after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/greenland-jd-vance-usha.html" title="">Vice President JD Vance visited an American military base</a> on the island. Mr. Trump reiterated that he would not rule out using force to annex Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of Denmark, but indicated that he thought he could make a deal to take it instead.</p><p>When asked what message he believed such a takeover would send to the rest of the world, including Russia, Mr. Trump said, “I don’t really think about that; I don’t really care.”</p><p>And with the Trump administration’s new auto tariffs set to take effect in days, the president said that he “couldn’t care less” whether automakers raise prices as a result of the increased costs to import cars and car parts to the United States. Mr. Trump added that he believed the tariffs could result in more people buying American-made cars.</p><p>Nearly half of all vehicles sold in the United States are imported, as are almost 60 percent of the parts used in vehicles that are assembled in the country.</p><p>Mr. Trump denied <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/trump-tariffs-automaker-prices-warning-928bc7a9" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a report</a> that he warned auto executives not to raise prices when discussing the tariffs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“I couldn’t care less,” he said. “I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are going to buy American-made cars.
