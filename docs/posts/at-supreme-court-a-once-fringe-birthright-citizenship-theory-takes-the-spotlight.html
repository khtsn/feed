Instead, courts have held that the amendment extended citizenship not just to the children of former slaves but also to babies born within the borders of the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The notion that the amendment might not do so was once considered an unorthodox theory, promoted by an obscure California law professor named John Eastman and his colleagues at the Claremont Institute, a conservative think tank — the same professor who would later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/20/us/politics/john-eastman-trump-jan-6.html" title="">provide Mr. Trump</a> with legal arguments he used to try to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>The story of how the theory moved from the far edges of academia to the Oval Office and, on Thursday, to the Supreme Court, offers insight into how Mr. Trump has popularized legal theories once considered unthinkable to justify his immigration policies.</p><p>“They have been pushing it for decades,” said John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law and a top lawyer in the George W. Bush administration. “It was thought to be a wacky idea that only political philosophers would buy. They’ve finally got a president who agrees.”</p><p>The White House did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>President Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/08/19/politics/donald-trump-birthright-american-citizenship" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">promoted the theory</a> during his first campaign but did not act on it until his second term. He signed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an executive order</a> on his first day to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants and some temporary foreign residents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump signing executive orders in the Oval Office on the first day of his second administration.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/trump-birthright-citizenship.html" title="">Legal challenges</a> were swift and emphatic. Challengers pointed to the text of the <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">14th Amendment</a>, which states, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Attorney General Andrea Campbell of Massachusetts spoke out in February against Mr. Trump’s executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship.

But the question of birthright citizenship will form the backdrop.</p><p>In an interview, Mr. Eastman said he developed his views on birthright citizenship after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.</p><p>Back then, Mr. Eastman, who had clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas, was a law professor at Chapman University in Orange County, Calif., and director of the Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/03/magazine/claremont-institute-conservative.html" title="">the Claremont Institute</a>.</p><p>In late November 2001, a man named <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/22/politics/us-agrees-to-release-american-caught-with-taliban.html" title="">Yaser Esam Hamdi</a> was taken into custody by U.S. forces in Afghanistan and transferred to the U.S. military base/prison at Guantánamo Bay.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Officials learned Mr. Hamdi was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/11/international/middleeast/us-returns-detainee-to-saudi-arabia-after-3-years.html" title="">an American citizen</a>. His mother, a Saudi national, had given birth to him while the family was living in Baton Rouge, La., where Mr. Hamdi’s father was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/washington/world/a-father-waits-as-the-us-and-the-saudis-discuss-his-sons.html" title="">working as a chemical engineer</a>.</p><p>Because Mr. Hamdi was a U.S. citizen, the authorities believed they could no longer hold him as an “enemy combatant” in Guantánamo Bay, where he was considered beyond the reach of the full legal protections of federal courts. They transferred him to a naval brig in Norfolk, Va.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yaser Esam Hamdi praying in his cell at Camp X-Ray at the U.S. military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In a 2004 friend-of-the-court <a href="https://www.claremont.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CCJ-Amicus_Hamdi-v_-Rumsfeld1-1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">brief</a> in the case, Mr. Eastman argued that the idea that citizenship was automatically conferred on all children born on American soil was a “generally accepted though erroneous interpretation” of the 14th Amendment that was “incorrect, as a matter of text, historical practice and political theory.”</p><p>Mr. Eastman drew on the work of a California State University, San Bernardino political science professor affiliated with the Claremont Institute, Edward J. Erler, who had offered the same theory in books published in 1997 and 2003.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Erler, who did not respond to a request for comment, <a href="https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/birthright-citizenship-and-dual-citizenship-harbingers-of-administrative-tyranny/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">argued</a> that the children of people in the country illegally, or temporarily, are not automatically citizens.</p><p>Although the idea that children born in the United States automatically become citizens has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/trump-birthright-citizenship-dred-scott.html" title="">deep roots in the common law</a>, it was not adopted in the text of the Constitution until 1868, as part of the 14th Amendment. It came in a sentence that overturned <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/60/393" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dred Scott</a>, the 1857 Supreme Court decision that affirmed slavery and helped prompt the Civil War.</p><p>Mr. Eastman claimed that nowhere during the debate over the 14th Amendment had lawmakers agreed to include temporary visitors.</p><p>The justices rejected this view, <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/542/507/#tab-opinion-1961673" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">finding</a> that the Constitution’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/29/politics/justices-affirm-legal-rights-of-enemy-combatants.html" title="">due process protections</a> applied to Mr. Hamdi.</p><p>Still, for years afterward, Mr. Eastman and Mr. Yoo <a href="https://fedsoc.org/commentary/videos/does-the-fourteenth-amendment-guarantee-birthright-citizenship-policybrief" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publicly debated</a> the issue, with Mr. Eastman arguing his theory that birthright citizenship was not in the Constitution and <a href="https://americanmind.org/features/the-case-against-birthright-citizenship-2/challenging-the-claremont-view-of-birthright-citizenship/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Yoo</a> <a href="https://www.civitasinstitute.org/research/birthright-citizenship-is-american-citizenship" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arguing</a> it was.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>For much of that time, the debate felt abstract, Mr. Yoo said, of interest mostly to legal scholars.</p><p>“Never has an abstract idea had such enormous policy effects,” he said. “It’s like it almost just jumped from law review articles to the White House.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>John Yoo, a law professor at U.C.

Mr. O’Reilly seemed skeptical at first, and then increasingly frustrated.</p><p>Mr. O’Reilly pointed to the 14th Amendment as an impediment to Mr. Trump’s plan. But Mr. Trump responded, “I think you’re wrong about the 14th Amendment.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“I can quote it — do you want me to quote you the amendment,” Mr. O’Reilly said, nearly shouting. “If you’re born here, you’re an American — period! Period!”</p><p>“But there are many lawyers, many lawyers are saying that’s not the way it is,” Mr. Trump responded.</p><p>Mr. Eastman said Mr. Trump was “likely” referring to him but also to other academics who had published on the issue. He said he was not sure how his views had reached the presidential candidate.</p><p>Mr. Trump did not pursue a plan to end birthright citizenship in his first term. Mr. Eastman said that in 2019 he met with Attorney General William P. Barr at Mr. Barr’s invitation to discuss a possible executive order on birthright citizenship but that nothing came of it. Mr. Barr did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Eastman said he was “very happy” when Mr. Trump announced he would end birthright citizenship on his first day back in office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>By then, Mr. Eastman and Mr. Trump had a close association. Mr. Eastman was one of the architects of a plan to create fake slates of pro-Trump electors in states that Joseph R. Biden Jr. won and to urge Vice President Mike Pence to accept those slates while presiding over the certification of the 2020 election.</p><p>A California judge <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/fd730cf01ca6812b/e3258bd4-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recommended</a> that Mr. Eastman be disbarred over the episode. He said he was appealing, though his California law license is currently inactive as a result. He is also fighting criminal charges that are slowly making their way through state court in Arizona.
