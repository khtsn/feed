The rock was most likely flung into space by an impact on the lunar surface that occurred sometime within the past tens of thousand years, according to <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad9ea8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a study</a> published earlier this month in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p><p>This is the second time scientists have linked a near-Earth object to the moon, after a 2021 study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-021-00303-7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">identified the object 469219 Kamoʻoalewa</a> as possibly lunar in origin. Taken together, the research reveals a population of exiled moon rocks, or “lunar ejecta,” that has remained hidden up until now.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“We knew that lunar ejecta were potentially hiding in these kinds of really near-Earth orbits,” said Teddy Kareta, a postdoctoral researcher at Lowell Observatory in Arizona who led the research.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/22/23sci-mini-moon-89168-cover/23sci-mini-moon-89168-cover-square640.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/22/23sci-mini-moon-89168-cover/23sci-mini-moon-89168-cover-square640.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/01/22/132989_1_23sci-mini-moon-89168_wg_mobile_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The asteroid 2024 PT5 was probably the result of an earlier object’s collision with the moon.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Tony Dunn</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Earth often encounters drifting objects, including asteroids or meteoroids, that can become temporary moons or “quasi-satellites.” Advanced observatories, such as the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, or ATLAS, are designed to spot these fellow travelers, which are typically visible for only weeks or months.</p><p>2024 PT5 was initially detected by ATLAS on Aug. 7, a discovery that galvanized follow-up observations around the world. On Aug. 16, Dr. Kareta and his colleagues spied the object with the Lowell Discovery Telescope in Arizona and the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility in Hawaii.</p><p>Dr. Kareta compared the light patterns reflected off the rock to how light has been observed bouncing off other extraterrestrial surfaces. He discovered a strong match with silicate-rich lunar grains collected by Apollo crews and a Soviet robot lander. The object also followed a distinctive “horseshoe” trajectory during its encounter with Earth, a fact that hints at a local origin.</p><p>The rock’s meandering path ignited debate over whether the object should really be called a mini-moon, as it never entered Earth’s orbit. But the term is still used loosely in both academic and popular contexts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“In a formal sense, this object did not orbit the Earth, but it was really, really close,” Dr. Kareta said. “We don’t have a great vocabulary to describe the exact scenario for this object which, for a brief period of time, was barely moving with respect to the Earth.”</p><p>Vishnu Reddy, a professor of planetary science at the University of Arizona who reviewed the study, said the team did a “remarkable job” of assessing the possible origins of 2024 PT5.</p><p>“The circumstantial evidence makes the lunar option the most logical one,” said Dr. Reddy, who also previously served as a doctoral adviser to two of the study’s authors. “But unless you go and bring a sample back, you cannot tell for sure this is a piece of the moon.”</p><p>There are no current plans to gather pieces of 2024 PT5 to Earth for study on Earth. But China is developing <a href="https://www.eppcgs.org/article/doi/10.26464/epp2025015" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a mission called Tianwen-2</a> to collect samples from 469219 Kamoʻoalewa, the other object pegged as a moon rock.</p><p>Raul de la Fuente Marcos, an astronomer at the Complutense University of Madrid who was not involved in the study, called it a “compelling case” for a lunar origin of 2024 PT5. This explanation aligns with his own team’s findings in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08834" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forthcoming paper</a> that identified a third rock, 2022 NX1, as yet another possible piece of the moon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>This growing family of moon rocks around Earth is packed with insights about our planetary backyard. One study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02258-z" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has already tried</a> to trace the origins of 469219 Kamoʻoalewa back to the moon’s Giordano Bruno crater, raising the possibility of matching future rocks to specific lunar sites. These efforts could illuminate the processes that shape lunar rocks on and off the moon — while also satisfying the popular demand for new mini-moons.</p><p>“It’s good to see the public interested in asteroids that aren’t going to kill us,” Dr. Kareta said. “What a pleasure.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">What’s Up in Space and Astronomy</h2><h3>Keep track of things going on in our solar system and all around the universe.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p>Never miss a rocket launch, meteor shower, eclipse or other 2025 event that’s out of this world with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2025/science/astronomy-space-calendar-events">our space and </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2025/science/astronomy-space-calendar-events">astronomy calendar</a>.</p></li><li><p>Blue Origin, owned by Jeff Bezos, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/science/bezos-blue-origin-launch.html">sent its first rocket into orbit</a>, raising the chances that it could grow to credibly compete with SpaceX.</p></li><li><p>The F.A.A. began an investigation of a SpaceX test flight explosion that rained debris over the Caribbean, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/us/politics/faa-spacex-musk.html">suspended additional liftoffs by Starship</a>.</p></li><li><p>Charon, Pluto’s largest moon, is locked in a tight orbit with the dwarf planet. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/science/pluto-moon-kiss-charon.html">A new simulation suggests how it ended up there</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/science/trump-nasa-mars-sample-return.html">NASA officials revised the Mars Sample Return mission</a> to reduce the budget and bring red planet rocks to Earth sooner than planned, but they will leave the final decisions about the effort to the incoming Trump administration.</p></li><li><p>Is Pluto a planet?
