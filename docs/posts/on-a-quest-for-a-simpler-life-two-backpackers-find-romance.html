He had been working his entire life with the dream of traveling the world once he retired. But, despite being “fit as a fiddle,” Ms. Rishiraj said, he passed away suddenly and never got to live that dream.</p><p>It was an awakening for Ms. Rishiraj, who was then a 22-year-old freelance journalist. She had wanted to become a journalist since she was 9 and had put a lot of pressure on herself to do so.</p><p>“I was like, ‘Why am I not on BBC at 10 o’clock?,’” said Ms. Rishiraj, who grew up in London. Ultimately, she said she realized, “‘I’m 22 years old. I need to slow down. Life is so precious.’”</p><p>In 2016, she decided to take a break from her career and backpack across Southeast Asia and Australia for three months. That October, she settled in Sydney.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Rishiraj first met Ryan Anthony Hawkins at the Bounce Sydney Hostel in March 2017. They were assigned to the same bunk bed in Room 203: He was on the bottom bunk, and she was on the top.</p><p>Mr. Hawkins had also traveled throughout Southeast Asia in 2015. When he returned to his hometown, Regina, Canada, he felt that completing a bachelor’s degree in kinesiology at the University of Regina was not the path that would fulfill him.</p><p>He identified a particular trajectory that was common around him: “Everyone goes to uni or goes into the trades, they marry within their friend group or their high school sweethearts,” he said, adding that he knew “that really wasn’t me.” After spending two months in Thailand, Cambodia and Laos, he decided to travel more and take advantage of his early 20s.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The civil ceremony took place on Aug. 19 in Willow Lane Barn in Olds, Alberta, where the couple were married in front of 75 guests by Ray Recto, a close friend of the couple.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Epic Stories</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>He spent 2016 bartending and saving money, and, in January 2017, moved to Sydney, where he worked at a deli. “For a backpacker who just needed his room and beer paid for, it was a great gig,” Mr. Hawkins said. “I started at 6, I was done by 2 and I was at the beach by 2:30.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In March 2017, Mr. Hawkins and Ms. Rishiraj ended up together at Bounce by chance: The hostel he had previously been staying in was fully booked during a week in which both Justin Bieber and Adele were performing in the city.</p><p>It’s typical for the people in the same hostel room to spend time with each other, they said. Ms. Rishiraj and Mr. Hawkins, along with some of their other six roommates, ate together, explored the city, relaxed on beaches and played board games.</p><p>On St. Patrick’s Day, they hung out on the rooftop of the hostel and attempted to play drinking games. But “we completely ignored the game,” Mr. Hawkins said. “We were just chatting.”</p><p>They talked about where they were from, their future plans and other cities they wanted to explore. “On paper, me and Naina are vastly different people,” Mr. Hawkins said. She’s from a major global city; he’s from a small city in central Canada. But they bonded over diverging from the path that had been set up for them and instead being drawn to travel.</p><p>A few days later, they met at Guylian Belgian Chocolate Café, a dessert lounge. He had “saved all his beer money for that week,” she said, to pay for a large hot chocolate, which they shared on the rainy evening.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“On paper, me and Naina are vastly different people,” Mr. Hawkins said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Epic Stories</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yet they bonded over diverging from expectations and being drawn to a simpler life.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Epic Stories</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>They went for a stroll afterward and sat on a bench by the Sydney Opera House. As they looked off into the Sydney Harbor Bridge, they lamented how they’d probably never see each other again. She had already booked a flight to Melbourne before meeting Mr. Hawkins and had plans to move there in a few days.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“You run into people all the time, you make new friends and that’s just how it goes when you backpack,” Ms. Rishiraj said.</p><p>Mr. Hawkins told her that night, “If we had been together in the same city for a long time, I would have asked you to be my girlfriend,” she recalled. “And I started crying.”</p><p>The day before her flight to Melbourne, Ms. Rishiraj hosted a night out. She kept a notebook with messages from the people she met during her travels. Mr. Hawkins wrote in it: “What me and you have had in a short period of time, I will cherish forever … one day I hope we can be in the same place for a long time.”</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/vows" title=""><em>Binge more Vows columns here</em></a></strong><strong><em> and </em></strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/fashion/weddings" title=""><em>read all our wedding, relationship and divorce coverage here</em></a></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p>Off she went to Melbourne, thinking they would never see each other again. But they continued messaging and calling each other. On May 13, his birthday, she flew to Sydney, knocked on his door and surprised him.</p><p>“It was very ballsy of me because, to be honest, I didn’t know whether he had moved on to somebody else,” Ms. Rishiraj said. They spent that weekend together. “We were like, OK, clearly this is something more.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>A few weeks later, Ms. Rishiraj was talking to a co-worker in the toy section of a department store, where she worked, about Mr. Hawkins and her uncertainty about their future. And just then, her co-worker saw Mr. Hawkins approaching. He had flown out to surprise Ms. Rishiraj for her birthday.</p><p>“It was something out of a movie,” Ms. Rishiraj said. “I just ran up to him, and he picked me up and twirled me around.” Even her manager was cheering.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“That’s really what built our foundation as a couple,” Ms. Rishiraj said of their early relationship. “We met each other when we didn’t have anything to give each other, other than presence.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Epic Stories</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In June 2017, he moved to Melbourne to be with her. They lived their best life on a budget: exploring new neighborhoods, frequenting night markets, going to speakeasy jazz bars and strolling along St. Kilda Beach. They found discounted tickets on Groupon, including tickets to a cherry blossom festival. There, they scored a helicopter ride above the Yarra Valley for $27.</p><p>“We didn’t need much then,” Mr. Hawkins said.</p><p>“It was just a simple time,” Ms. Rishiraj added. “That’s really what built our foundation as a couple. We met each other when we didn’t have anything to give each other, other than presence. It wasn’t based on materialism. Communication and trust — we had to build it right from the get-go.”</p><p>Her Australian visa would be ending that October, and his would be ending in January 2018. They were trying to figure out next steps, and she wasn’t ready to go back to the London grind.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>He suggested that she move to Canada with him. After spending some time with her family in London, she received her Canadian visa.</p><p>They moved to Regina in March 2018 and to Calgary in March 2019, where they live today. Mr. Hawkins, 31, is a realtor; Ms. Rishiraj, 32, is an elementary schoolteacher. Ms. Rishiraj graduated from Staffordshire University in England with a bachelor’s degree in broadcast journalism. She also received a bachelor’s of education from Ambrose University in Calgary.</p><p>In August 2022, the couple went to Athens for her cousin’s wedding. There, Mr. Hawkins was “getting harassed by the aunties,” he said, for not having proposed yet. All along, he had a ring with him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“It was something out of a movie,” Ms. Rishiraj said of when Mr. Hawkins surprised her in Melbourne. “I just ran up to him and he picked me up and twirled me around.” </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Epic Stories</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>After the wedding in Athens, the couple went to Crete. He proposed after a sunset dinner on a rooftop overlooking a lighthouse.</p><p>In August 2024, the couple hosted a week of wedding events, including a welcome dinner and a haldi, or turmeric ceremony, in their friend’s backyard in Calgary. The couple wore matching yellow and pink outfits: She in a sari, he in a kurta. Ms. Rishiraj’s mother, Naresh Rishiraj, brought out her red wedding dupatta and put it over Ms. Rishiraj’s head — a Sikh tradition that is said to bless the bride.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The civil ceremony took place on Aug. 19 in Willow Lane Barn in Olds, Alberta. Ray Recto, a close friend of the couple, who received a one-day marriage officiant license from the government of Alberta, officiated before 75 guests. They wore custom rings engraved with the coordinates of Bounce Sydney Hostel.</p><p>There was also a pre-wedding ceremony at Meadow Muse Pavilion, an event venue in Fish Creek Provincial Park in Calgary. The event celebrated Ms. Rishiraj’s Indian and British roots with “high chai vibes,” she said, “where the vibrant flavors of Mumbai street food meet the regal charm of ‘Bridgerton.’” There was a London-style telephone booth, except it was white and decorated with pink and purple flowers.</p><p>And finally, there was a Hindu ceremony at Canmore Ranch, followed by a reception at Cornerstone Theater. Mr. Hawkins rolled in on a horse and carriage to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxh-se25lQo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bhangra remix</a> of Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road.” He was greeted by Ms. Rishiraj’s family, with whom he had to barter and pay with cash in order to see his bride.</p><p>For his vows, Mr. Hawkins called back to the message he wrote to Ms. Rishiraj in Sydney before she moved to Melbourne. “My darling wife, here’s to being in the same city for the rest of our lives.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After the civil ceremony, a reception was held inside a barn.
