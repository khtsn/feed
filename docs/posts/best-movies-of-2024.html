In the movie world, things are always looking up (maybe) unless they’re catastrophically down, a cycle of boom and bust that has gripped the industry for much of its history and always convinces someone, somewhere, that the movies are dead. It’s a familiar charge with a changing cast of murder suspects: synchronized sound, television, cable, streaming and, of course, corporate idiocy.</p><p>Despite their continued decline, the big American-based studios still dominate the mainstream media coverage and what little attention an increasingly fragmented, distracted audience has remaining. To that end, nearly every week another megadollar production comes hurtling toward us, gobbles up all the media interest, rakes in fortunes or becomes just another tax write-down or write-off. Some of these movies are OK, others are bilge; a scant few are memorable. Yet as my hardworking colleagues and I eagerly share in our reviews for The New York Times, the movie world is much vaster than what these companies offer, and good, great and miraculous work often flies under the radar. Here’s a sampling of the bounty.</p><h3 id="link-5805299f"><span>1. ‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/movies/all-we-imagine-as-light-review.html" title="">All We Imagine as Light</a>’ (Payal Kapadia)</span></h3><p>This delicate, achingly wistful story about empathy is an example of the same, and centers on two female nurses and a cook, friends who work at the same hospital in Mumbai. Over the course of the movie, Kapadia shifts between these caregivers who together and separately experience ordinary pleasures, face painful difficulties and find comfort, support and companionship in one another. Every so often, Kapadia, who has also made documentaries, incorporates images of everyday people milling through the city, images that connect her characters to a sea of humanity and, by extension, to those of us watching.

Generally short and now shot in digital, these moving images have no scripted dialogue and nothing resembling a plot. Liberated from the stranglehold of story, Gehr’s movies instead present and re-present outwardly ordinary places, objects and moving bodies — white clouds drifting across a stretch of blue city sky, people walking in front of a windowed storefront — that Gehr turns into heady studies of energy, chance, light, surface and space. Your perception of the world change when filmmakers like Gehr show it to you through their liberated lenses and frames. These are movies that expand and, at times, gloriously blow your mind.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="checkbox-embed" data-id="100000009838020" data-source-id="100000009838020"><div slug="checkbox-embed" data-sourceid="100000009838020" id="embed-id-100000009838020">

Written and directed by Eisenberg, it stars him and Kieran Culkin as American cousins who were once close and now, following the death of their grandmother, a Holocaust survivor, find themselves fumbling toward each other during a so-called heritage tour in Poland. Their trip is deeply touching, at times laugh-out-loud funny and altogether unexpected, partly because Eisenberg understands that life isn’t a tidy life lesson and that some things remain essentially unknowable, including other people.

For much of the movie, she is behind the wheel of her jalopy, a home away from home, or interviewing badly injured people as potential cautionary tales for a workplace safety video commissioned by a multinational corporation. As she racks up miles, traversing a world where capitalism and the ghosts of communism converge, the movie touches on Romania’s past and present, the East and the West, high culture and exceedingly low.

They’re the kind of familiar souvenirs that African street vendors sell not far from the city’s imposing Quai Branly Museum, which is where workers are packing up crates and Diop’s movie begins taking shape. Inside those crates are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/arts/design/france-benin-restitution.html" title="">26 treasures</a> that were looted by French troops in 1892 and that France returned to Benin in 2019, an event that Diop turns — with the help of some students and one of those treasures, a statue that speaks in voice-over — into a precise, lucid exploration of cultural and artistic patrimony in the wake of colonialism.

Art-house regulars might recognize this flat from his earlier films, including “Aquarius” (2016), in which Sônia Braga plays a woman fighting eviction. Here, Mendonça Filho uses the apartment as an axis point for an inquiry that radiates out in different directions — into his past and his mother’s, onto old movie sets and through abandoned cinemas — yet always returns home. <em>(Stream it on </em><a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/pictures-of-ghosts" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>the Criterion Channel</em></a><em>)</em></p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-18"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="checkbox-embed" data-id="100000009838020" data-source-id="100000009838020"><div slug="checkbox-embed" data-sourceid="100000009838020" id="embed-id-100000009838020">

The movie focuses on a utopian architect (Adam Driver) with a world-changing plan that bursts with ideas and beauty, giving the story a poignant self-referential undercurrent. The movie was never going to be for everyone; art rarely is. Even so, it was disheartening how eagerly some media types, including critics, dismissed it. After its release, the industry journalist Richard Rushfield shot back at the glibber criticisms, writing <a href="https://theankler.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in the Substack publication The Ankler,</a> that “‘Megalopolis’ exists because one of the greatest directors in film history, at the end of a long career, decided to spend his own money on a film he wanted to make.” As Rushfield put it, “Truly, if you have a problem with that, you need to consider maybe you just don’t like film.” Co-sign. <em>(Available for rent on </em><a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/megalopolis/umc.cmc.4a4dlwi05nu8x5f4fanucc5nv?playableId=tvs.sbd.9001%3A1770140881" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>most major platforms</em></a>)</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-24"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="checkbox-embed" data-id="100000009838020" data-source-id="100000009838020"><div slug="checkbox-embed" data-sourceid="100000009838020" id="embed-id-100000009838020">

Largely set along the border between Poland and Belarus, it toggles among an assortment of characters, including a Syrian family struggling to enter the European Union, activists providing aid to migrants and guards tasked with violently upholding national interests. A fiction drawn from fact, the movie builds to a shattering coda that lays bare the prejudices that countries try to hide in the name of patriotism.

There, under a canopy of green vegetation, she invites him to look at some of the plants that she’s studying and he settles alongside her. Moss, she explains, was here before we humans and will probably be here after we’re gone. Such is the way of life in a movie about immanence and transcendence, and about being alive to a world in which we are all, finally, passers-by. “You blink,” as another character says, “and everything’s gone.” (<em>Stream it on </em><a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/here" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>the Criterion Channel</em></a>)</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-32"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="checkbox-embed" data-id="100000009838020" data-source-id="100000009838020"><div slug="checkbox-embed" data-sourceid="100000009838020" id="embed-id-100000009838020">

This year is the unpredictable kind. I could make a list of great 2024 films that’s five times as long as this one, but those that bubbled to the top for me had something in common: They’re what I call algorithm breakers. They elude easy categorization, keeping us off balance.</p><p>Looking at my list, I realized most of my favorites this year came from artists who worked across disciplines — playwrights directing movies, documentarians taking on fiction — or who zig when you’re expecting a zag, counting on the audience to lean in and pay attention. While giant corporations were spending billions to better predict your taste, 2024’s best movies ask you to keep the algorithm-keepers on their toes.</p><h3 id="link-44d7012b"><span>1. ‘Nickel Boys’ (RaMell Ross)</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-34"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Brandon Wilson and Ethan Herisse in “Nickel Boys.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Katie Skelly</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><p>Ross cut his teeth in documentary filmmaking — his formally daring “Hale County This Morning, This Evening” was nominated for an Oscar in 2019 — but with “Nickel Boys,” he turns to fiction. Sort of. His adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s novel is boldly radical, transforming the text into a mostly first-person film that captures the spirit of the source material — a meditation on how trauma shapes a person’s sense of self — by harnessing the visual and aural tools that cinema provides. He grafts archival nonfiction footage onto the movie and frequently challenges the ways we’ve been trained to think a story like this should be told, with results that are both straightforward and extraordinary. I’m amazed this movie exists. I’m so glad it does. <em>(Opens in theaters on Dec. 13)</em></p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-36"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="checkbox-embed" data-id="100000009838020" data-source-id="100000009838020"><div slug="checkbox-embed" data-sourceid="100000009838020" id="embed-id-100000009838020">

But the real crux of the tale is in what goes unsaid, what happens just behind Madison’s eyes. The theme of all of Baker’s films is the make-believe reality of the American dream; the variation “Anora” plays has to do with fairy tales, fantasies and finally seeing the world straight on. <em>(In theaters)</em></p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-42"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="checkbox-embed" data-id="100000009838020" data-source-id="100000009838020"><div slug="checkbox-embed" data-sourceid="100000009838020" id="embed-id-100000009838020">

Grimonprez comes at it from every direction, exploring the ways truth can be exposed and ignored and shoved underground, all set to the driving rhythm of the Black jazz musicians who both protested and were, at times, unwittingly used by covert American government operations.

It’s Hamaguchi’s follow-up to “Drive My Car,” and it’s similarly intent on plumbing the meaning of human connection in an individualistic world. In the film, a rural community is concerned about a company that wishes to build a “glamping” site nearby, which will have devastating environmental consequences.
