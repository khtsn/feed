Some said they had left their countries to escape persecution and feared for their safety if they were to be sent back.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Thursday, when the plane landed at Juan Santamaría International Airport outside San José, a group of reporters that had gathered on the tarmac captured images of the migrants on board.</p><p>They held their cellphones to the windows, revealing both that they were not in handcuffs and had not had their devices taken away.</p><p>Officials said 135 people were on the flight: 65 children and 70 adults, including one older person and two pregnant women. “They are all families; they come as family units,” said Omer Badilla, the deputy minister of governance and director of Costa Rica’s migration authority.</p><p>Another 65 migrants would be arriving to the country in the coming days, Mr. Badilla said, noting that Costa Rica had committed to receiving 200 migrants in total.</p><p>The flight carried people from more than a dozen nations, officials said. More than half of the group was from just a few countries: Uzbekistan, China and Armenia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>There were also people on board from Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, Jordan, Russia and Georgia.</p><p>Asked by a reporter what would happen to the people who refused to be returned to their country of origin, Mr. Badilla said: “Most, or almost all, want to return to their countries. Specific cases will be addressed if there is a particular request.”</p><p>He said: “This is simply a request from the United States for collaboration. We understand that they already were in the deportation process, and what the U.S. is doing is seeking an ally to assist in supplying a platform for transporting them to their countries.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A bus carrying migrants deported from the United States leaving the Juan Santamaría International Airport outside the Costa Rican capital of San José on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ezequiel Becerra/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The plane was surrounded by about 20 police officers. The deportees were disembarked at a distance from the scrum of reporters and immediately boarded onto several buses marked “tourism” that were waiting on the runway.</p><p>When Costa Rica’s president, Rodrigo Chaves, spoke of the flight at a news conference this week, he said his country’s government had felt compelled to accept the deportees in particular because they included children.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Costa Rica has touted its record on upholding human rights, including when it comes to the treatment of migrants.</p><p>From the airport, the migrants would be transferred to a remote facility called the Temporary Attention Center for Migrants, officials said. It lies in the southern canton of Corredores, more than 200 miles from the capital.</p><p>“We’ve thrown out the possibility of a hotel, precisely to avoid a situation similar to that in Panama,” Mr. Badilla, the migration official, told The Associated Press.</p><p>Costa Rica’s government has stipulated that the migrants remain in the country no more than 30 days before being sent to their countries of origin, an operation that it has said will be supervised by United Nations agencies, including the International Organization for Migration, and financed by the United States. However, Mr. Chaves has conceded that in some cases arranging deportations could take longer.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
