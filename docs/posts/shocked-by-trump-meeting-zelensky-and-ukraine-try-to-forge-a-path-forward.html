Ukraine announced plans on Saturday for a joint weapons venture with France that would be <a href="https://mod.gov.ua/news/ukrayina-zaproponuvala-francziyi-vikoristovuvati-dohodi-vid-zamorozhenih-aktiviv-rf-na-korist-ukrayinskogo-opk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">financed by the interest earned from frozen Russian assets</a>.</p><p>Later in the day, Mr. Zelensky met with Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, who has been a supporter of the Ukrainian president in the face of Mr. Trump’s harsh rebukes. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In a stark contrast to Friday’s meeting in Washington, the visit to 10 Downing Street began with a warm handshake and a short embrace.<span>  </span>It included a promise from Mr. Starmer to the Ukrainian president that “you have full backing across the United Kingdom, and we stand with you and Ukraine for as long as it takes.” </p><p>On Sunday, Mr. Zelensky will attend a summit of European leaders hosted by Mr. Starmer.</p><p>While much of the focus was on the shocking tone and theatrics of the dressing-down delivered by the American president to a putative ally, Professor O’Brien, the St. Andrew’s scholar, said that Mr. Trump’s comments suggested that the root of the public rupture ran deeper.</p><p>“He was trying to pressure Zelensky into agreeing to a cease-fire along Putin’s lines, and Zelensky refused,” Professor O’Brien said, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. “Trump comes out and says that explicitly at the end.”</p><p>Mr. Trump had shouted at the Ukrainian leader, “You’re buried there,” and said, “Your people are dying. You’re running low on soldiers.”</p><p>As Mr. Zelensky tried to defend himself, Mr. Trump talked over him.</p><p>“No, listen,” he continued. “And then you tell us, ‘I don’t want a cease-fire. I don’t want a cease-fire.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After the meeting between Mr. Zelensky and President Trump, many Ukrainians were moving toward a conclusion: Mr. Trump has chosen a side, and it is not Ukraine’s.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The exchange, Professor O’Brien said, reflects Mr. Trump’s belief that “Ukraine should shut up and take Trump’s and Putin’s terms.”</p><p>The real affront that prompted the spectacle, many Ukrainians and analysts believe, is that Mr. Zelensky pushed back against some of Mr. Trump’s terms.</p><p>Along the front lines, some soldiers said that the realization was sinking in that Mr. Trump would probably not help Ukraine. “Trump chose his side in this war,” said Pvt. Serhiy Hnezdilov in a telephone interview from the front on Saturday.</p><p>Private Hnezdilov said that he supported Mr. Zelensky’s stance, adding that he thought the attempt to humiliate the Ukrainian leader was probably the goal of the invitation to the White House.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“The scandal we witnessed was essentially the only purpose of that meeting,” the private said. “It looked utterly absurd, considering that we, Ukrainians, have always regarded America as an example of democracy and, most importantly, of values.”</p><p>Ukrainians may have been naïve, he added.</p><p>Still, many Ukrainians were shaken by the public falling-out in Washington, and Mr. Zelensky sought to reassure his war-weary nation on Saturday.</p><p>“People in Ukraine need to know they are not alone, that their interests are represented in every country and every corner of the world,” he said in a statement.</p><p>Leaders across Europe took to social media to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/trump-zelensky-europe-leaders.html" title="">voice support of Ukraine</a>, and Mr. Zelensky offered his personal thanks for every statement while reposting them.</p><p>But Mr. Zelensky did acknowledge that losing U.S. military support would be a devastating blow.</p><p>“It will be difficult for us,” he told Fox News after the White House meeting. “That’s why I’m here.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, welcomed President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to 10 Downing Street on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Peter Nicholls/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Zelensky’s domestic standing appeared to be holding steady in the immediate aftermath of the meeting, despite a statement by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, calling for Mr. Zelensky to resign or be dismissed. “I don’t know if we can ever do business” Mr. Graham said, only days after praising the Ukrainian leader as an ideal ally.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky received a public signal of support from the speaker of the Ukrainian Parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, who would assume the presidency if Mr. Zelensky resigned. “Full support for the President of Ukraine!” Mr. Stefanchuk wrote in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/stefanchuk.official/posts/pfbid02hZaS5KkJS1jZymK7PanS4Z5J8gdQDAZtsLYM9wiKAAXC1zqHtyBRRmPd8DJpX1Q4l" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a social media post</a>.</p><p>Opposition figures also backed Mr. Zelensky.</p><p>“Though I do not fully agree with President Zelensky’s policies, I must say that I am genuinely grateful to him for withstanding this pressure,” Natalia Pipa, a member of Parliament for the Holos party, said in an interview.</p><p>“Trump behaved disgustingly and condescendingly,” she added. </p><p>The path ahead for Ukraine, politicians and analysts said, was to try to repair relations with the United States, where defense contractors are one constituency with an interest in continuing American support, while trying to shore up European backing. Mr. Zelensky will also be trying to get a role in the negotiations for a peace settlement, though Mr. Trump seems intent on dealing directly with Mr. Putin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/trump-zelensky-us-ukraine-russia.html" title="">the anger directed at Mr. Zelensky</a> in the Oval Office came against a tense backdrop in which Mr. Trump has increasingly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/world/europe/putin-trump-russia-us.html" title="">aligned himself with the Kremlin</a> in both words and actions.</p><p>Since Mr. Trump picked up the phone on Feb. 12 for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/world/europe/putin-trump-call-russia-ukraine.html" title="">a 90-minute chat with Mr. Putin</a>, he has called Mr. Zelensky “a dictator”; falsely accused Ukraine of starting the war; and pressed the Ukrainian leader to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-says-trump-is-disinformation-bubble-ukraine-2025-02-19/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accede to his administration’s demands</a>, posting that he “better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.”</p><p>Last week, the State Department terminated an initiative that has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to help restore Ukraine’s energy grid after attacks by the Russian military.</p><p>While pressuring Kyiv, Mr. Trump has said that he would “love” to see Russia back in the Group of 7 — a gathering of the world’s wealthiest large democracies — and that “it was a mistake to throw them out.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Vladimir V.
