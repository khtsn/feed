Ukraine announced plans on Saturday for a joint weapons venture with France that would be <a href="https://mod.gov.ua/news/ukrayina-zaproponuvala-francziyi-vikoristovuvati-dohodi-vid-zamorozhenih-aktiviv-rf-na-korist-ukrayinskogo-opk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">financed by the interest earned from frozen Russian assets</a>.</p><p>Later in the day, Mr. Zelensky was scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, who has been a supporter of the Ukrainian president in the face of Mr. Trump’s harsh rebukes. On Sunday, Mr. Zelensky will attend a summit of European leaders hosted by Mr. Starmer.</p><p>While much of the focus was on the shocking tone and theatrics of the dressing-down delivered by the American president to a putative ally, Professor O’Brien, the St. Andrew’s scholar, said that Mr. Trump’s comments suggested that the root of the public rupture ran deeper.</p><p>“He was trying to pressure Zelensky into agreeing to a cease-fire along Putin’s lines, and Zelensky refused,” Professor O’Brien said, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. “Trump comes out and says that explicitly at the end.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Trump had shouted at the Ukrainian leader, “You’re buried there,” and said, “Your people are dying. You’re running low on soldiers.”</p><p>As Mr. Zelensky tried to defend himself, Mr. Trump talked over him.</p><p>“No, listen,” he continued. “And then you tell us, ‘I don’t want a cease-fire. I don’t want a cease-fire.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After the meeting between Mr. Zelensky and President Trump, many Ukrainians were moving toward a conclusion: Mr. Trump has chosen a side, and it is not Ukraine’s.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The exchange, Professor O’Brien said, reflects Mr. Trump’s belief that “Ukraine should shut up and take Trump’s and Putin’s terms.”</p><p>The real affront that prompted the spectacle, many Ukrainians and analysts believe, is that Mr. Zelensky pushed back against some of Mr. Trump’s terms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Along the front lines, some soldiers said that the realization was sinking in that Mr. Trump would probably not help Ukraine. “Trump chose his side in this war,” said Pvt. Serhiy Hnezdilov in a telephone interview from the front on Saturday.</p><p>Private Hnezdilov said that he supported Mr. Zelensky’s stance, adding that he thought the attempt to humiliate the Ukrainian leader was probably the goal of the invitation to the White House.</p><p>“The scandal we witnessed was essentially the only purpose of that meeting,” the private said. “It looked utterly absurd, considering that we, Ukrainians, have always regarded America as an example of democracy and, most importantly, of values.”</p><p>Ukrainians may have been naïve, he added.</p><p>Still, many Ukrainians were shaken by the public falling-out in Washington, and Mr. Zelensky sought to reassure his war-weary nation on Saturday.</p><p>“People in Ukraine need to know they are not alone, that their interests are represented in every country and every corner of the world,” he said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Leaders across Europe took to social media to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/trump-zelensky-europe-leaders.html" title="">voice support of Ukraine</a>, and Mr. Zelensky offered his personal thanks for every statement while reposting them.</p><p>But Mr. Zelensky did acknowledge that losing U.S. military support would be a devastating blow.</p><p>“It will be difficult for us,” he told Fox News after the White House meeting. “That’s why I’m here.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain has been a supporter of Mr. Zelensky in the face of Mr. Trump’s comments.

Mr. Zelensky will also be trying to get a role in the negotiations for a peace settlement, though Mr. Trump seems intent on dealing directly with Mr. Putin.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/trump-zelensky-us-ukraine-russia.html" title="">the anger directed at Mr. Zelensky</a> in the Oval Office came against a tense backdrop in which Mr. Trump has increasingly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/world/europe/putin-trump-russia-us.html" title="">aligned himself with the Kremlin</a> in both words and actions.</p><p>Since Mr. Trump picked up the phone on Feb. 12 for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/world/europe/putin-trump-call-russia-ukraine.html" title="">a 90-minute chat with Mr. Putin</a>, he has called Mr. Zelensky “a dictator”; falsely accused Ukraine of starting the war; and pressed the Ukrainian leader to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-says-trump-is-disinformation-bubble-ukraine-2025-02-19/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accede to his administration’s demands</a>, posting that he “better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.”</p><p>Last week, the State Department terminated an initiative that has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to help restore Ukraine’s energy grid after attacks by the Russian military.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>While pressuring Kyiv, Mr. Trump has said that he would “love” to see Russia back in the Group of 7 — a gathering of the world’s wealthiest large democracies — and that “it was a mistake to throw them out.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Vladimir V.
