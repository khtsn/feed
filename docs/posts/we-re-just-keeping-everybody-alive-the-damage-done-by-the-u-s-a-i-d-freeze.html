Kennedy asked Congress to establish the U.S. Agency for International Development in 1961, <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/special-message-the-congress-foreign-aid-1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he rooted its mission</a> in America’s strategic interests and its “moral obligations as a wise leader and good neighbor,” recognizing that poverty and instability threaten America’s prosperity and security. That convergence of interests and values, upheld across Republican and Democratic administrations, is now at risk.</p><p>U.S.A.I.D. is not a perfect agency. No government institution is. But from the Green Revolution to humanitarian relief to the fight against H.I.V., it has built a more stable world while advancing U.S. interests.</p><p>Now, under the guise of a foreign aid “review,” Elon Musk and President Trump have frozen U.S.A.I.D. money and activities and appear to be working to dismantle the agency and almost entirely eliminate foreign aid programs. The few waivers that have been granted have not unfrozen a significant amount of money. As the testimonials below from around the world show, the immediate impact has been damaging and chaotic.</p><p>It is not too late to salvage the agency and its mission. The agency’s partner organizations are hanging on and its overseas missions seem to have remained mostly intact, for now. The laws establishing U.S.A.I.D. in federal statute and its budget appropriation remain in force and unaltered.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But Mr. Musk’s assault appears to be operating outside of any lawful or congressional process, so Congress and the courts must intervene. Multiple lawsuits have been filed, with two prompting restraining orders. But saving foreign aid will ultimately come down to whether Congress uses its constitutional leverage over the administration.</p><p>Lawmakers should consider how they will explain in the coming years why America could no longer stop a disease outbreak overseas from reaching the homeland. Or why thousands of children who depended on lifesaving nutritional supplies made in American plants were left to die. Or why <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/nx-s1-5300108/aid-cuts-and-china-muscles-in" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">China</a> is capitalizing on the vacuums left by America’s retreat.</p><p>None of those effects point to a safer or more prosperous future for America.</p><p><em>The following testimonies were gathered by the Times Opinion staff. Some individuals spoke on condition of anonymity. Some interviews have been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.</em></p><h2 id="link-5d2c63b">Africa</h2><p><strong>Sudan: Humanitarian aid</strong></p><p>U.S.A.I.D. has helped support the network of Emergency Response Rooms across Sudan, civilian-led groups that provide food and other humanitarian aid to hundreds of thousands of people during the country’s continuing civil war, according to Hajooj Kuka, an external communications officer for the E.R.R.s. <a href="https://www.wfp.org/emergencies/sudan-emergency" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Famine</a> has already been confirmed in or is projected to take hold in 10 parts of the country.</p><p>“At this moment, we’re trying our best to utilize the resources we have, but the way we’re doing it is using all the money we have from somewhere else. Really quickly, it’s just going to deplete. We have no clue if U.S.A.I.D. money is going to kick back in, or it’s just gone,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We’re just keeping everybody alive, and Sudan is on the verge of an outbreak of famine… A week of not finding food would actually mean a lot of death.”</p><p>“I’m not sure who the United States is.

Once that permission came through, staff members who would normally distribute the food were unavailable because their employer did not have the funding or permission to let them work.</p><p>Even as these problems get resolved, larger disruptions to the pipeline that supplies this lifesaving food may persist and prevent enough from reaching the area, the official said. “Our teams have requested funding to purchase the food locally to meet the demand. They are anticipating very high needs this summer, and they are concerned the food supply won’t be enough.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“We are plugging leaks in a system that is a dam that’s about to burst,” the official said. “How do we keep up with this, as the supply chains begin to break?”</p><p><strong>Burkina Faso: Human rights</strong></p><p>The government’s war against Islamist insurgents has escalated in Burkina Faso, leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians, the displacement of three million people, rampaging militias supported by the government and the forced conscription of government opponents.</p><p>The Collective Against Impunity and Stigmatization of Communities provides legal and psychological support for victims, as well as food and financial aid. U.S.A.I.D. funds its monitoring program, which employs some 40 people across the vast country to report on acts of violence and repression, said Daniel Salif Gnienhoun, the group’s permanent secretary. When the funds run out, these workers and their families will lose their source of income but worse, human rights violations will go unreported, he said.</p><p>“The human rights will be getting worse and worse,” Mr. Gnienhoun said. “Our rights will be violated, and no voice will be raised denouncing what’s going on in the country,” he said, adding: “The government will have the green light to do whatever they want. They can kill innocent civilians because nothing can be reported.”</p><h2 id="link-1bccb">Asia</h2><p><strong>Afghanistan: Education</strong></p><p>Classes at the American University of Afghanistan, an online school supported by U.S.A.I.D. and one of the last remaining options for higher education for women in the country, have been suspended since January.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“Last year, when I got accepted to AUAF, I was super happy.

Some local groups have had to lay off staff members, including more than 100 outreach workers who assist patients seeking H.I.V. treatment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“A major Indonesian government program to revamp access to primary care is supported in part by a U.S.A.I.D. project focused on maternal and newborn health, which has now been halted.
