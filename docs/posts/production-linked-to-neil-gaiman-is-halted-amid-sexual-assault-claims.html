But the allegations were not the sole reason that the production, which was in development, was paused. Disney would not provide any additional reasons.</p><p>Another production related to Mr. Gaiman has been canceled for unspecified reasons. “Dead Boy Detectives,” a TV series based on a comic book by Mr. Gaiman, will not return for a second season, according to Netflix, which declined to share why the series would not return. There have been no changes to the Netflix series “The Sandman,” which is based on a separate comic book series by Mr. Gaiman.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Amazon would not say whether there would be any changes to “Good Omens,” a series based on a novel by Mr. Gaiman written in collaboration with Terry Pratchett.</p><p>The turmoil around the productions linked to the author has come amid the launch of the podcast, which in July and August released six episodes that detail the women’s accounts. The series has drawn widespread attention among fans, in literary circles and in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Paul Caruana Galizia, a reporter on the podcast, said in an email that the podcast was produced over more than nine months. The podcast’s reporters reviewed messages and documents shared by the women, and featured interviews with the women.</p><p>Two women who spoke to the podcast were identified as Scarlett and K., and could not be reached for comment for this article. Two other women who spoke on the podcast, Caroline Wallner and Julia Hobsbawm, declined to be interviewed. The claims that these four women made on the podcast could not be independently verified by The New York Times.</p><p>There are no publicly known lawsuits or open police investigations related to the allegations against Mr. Gaiman. He and his representatives did not respond to requests for comment for this article.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Gaiman is the author of dozens of literary works, including the critically acclaimed “The Sandman” and the novella “Coraline,” which became an animated film. Mr. Gaiman’s works <a href="https://www.neilgaiman.com/About_Neil/Awards_and_Honors" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have earned numerous accolades</a>, including multiple Hugo Awards, the Newbery Medal and the Carnegie Medal. Time magazine named him one of the <a href="https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2023/6269441/neil-gaiman/#:~:text=Neil&#39;s%20point%20of%20entry%20into,that%20far%20removed%20from%20ours." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">100 most influential people of 2023</a>.</p><p>The allegations surfaced in early July when Scarlett and K. became the first two women to share their experiences on the podcast.</p><p>Scarlett told the podcast that she had made a sexual assault report against Mr. Gaiman to the police in New Zealand after the two had met in 2022. She was later told by the police that there was not enough evidence to pursue a case, she said on the podcast. The authorities in New Zealand declined to either comment on or confirm such a report against Mr. Gaiman, citing privacy laws in the country.</p><p>The most recent woman to come forward on “Master” with claims against Mr. Gaiman has been identified as Claire, a licensed therapist practicing in North Carolina. She said that she chose to use a pseudonym to protect her therapeutic relationship with her clients, many of whom are also survivors of sexual violence.</p><p>Claire told the “Master” podcast that Mr. Gaiman had groped her and kissed her in the back of a tour bus in Nashville in 2013. Claire also shared her story on the podcast series <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/s4-ep2-claire-i-ignored-it-and-i-believed-him-because/id1491575384?i=1000663604978" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Am I Broken: Survivor Stories,”</a> which features interviews with survivors of sexual trauma.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Times interviewed Claire and reviewed text messages and emails between her and Mr. Gaiman.</p><h2 id="link-525dacd7">‘Consent Is Not What Happened’</h2><p>Claire told the “Master” podcast in <a href="https://www.tortoisemedia.com/audio/episode-6-the-pattern/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an episode released on Aug. 27</a> that she first met Mr. Gaiman at an event in Asheville, N.C., on Sept. 16, 2012. Claire had volunteered to be an usher at the event for “The Moth” podcast, a stop on its Unchained Tour, which Mr. Gaiman had joined.</p><p>Mr. Gaiman later invited Claire to attend another stop on the tour in Charlotte, N.C., on Sept. 19.</p><p>After that, Mr. Gaiman and Claire exchanged emails and video calls over the course of several months, she said on the podcast. On one instance in July 2013, she said on the podcast, Mr. Gaiman tried to initiate phone sex with her.</p><p>“The phone sex he initiated was violent and explicit, nothing like the friendly and flirty emails and Skype calls that I had gotten used to over the previous months, and the sudden shift in tone made me deeply uncomfortable,” Claire said in an interview with The Times. “But he told me at the beginning of the call that I didn’t need to speak or participate, so I just stayed quiet and let him finish.”</p><p>They met later that month at a book event in Nashville. Mr. Gaiman was on tour at the time to promote his latest novel, “The Ocean at the End of the Lane.”</p><p>Claire said that before the event, she told Mr. Gaiman that she did not want to have sex with him.</p><p>“He reassured me that I didn’t have to worry and that I was under no obligation to do anything I didn’t want to do,” Claire said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>After the event, Mr. Gaiman took Claire to a room on a tour bus and began to kiss and grope her without her consent, Claire told the podcast. In the account Mr. Gaiman provided to the podcast, he said he tried to kiss Claire while on a bed in the back of the bus. But he stopped when he realized that Claire did not want to be kissed, the podcast reported.</p><p>“Consent is not what happened between me and Neil,” Claire told The Times about that encounter.</p><p>Claire did not report Mr. Gaiman to the police.</p><p>Claire said that she wanted to share the story about her own experience with Mr. Gaiman after hearing Scarlett and K. on “Master.” Claire said that when she had heard the women tell their stories, she felt as if she had “been punched in the chest.”</p><p>“It took me years to reconcile that the Neil Gaiman I thought I knew,” she said, “was the person who had taken advantage of me, and gaslit me into believing it was my fault.”</p><p>Claire said that nearly a decade later, in June 2022, she wrote a letter to Mr. Gaiman to confront him. After she wrote him the letter, they had two phone calls, she said. During the second call, Mr. Gaiman offered Claire $60,000 to be paid over four years, she said. Claire preferred one payment to avoid prolonged contact with Mr. Gaiman.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I didn’t want to hear from him ever again,” she said, “and getting a payment from him every year for four years wasn’t congruent with that.”</p><p>The Times reviewed emails between Claire and Mr. Gaiman about a payment. In August 2022, Claire said, she woke up one morning and saw that $60,000 had been deposited into her bank account.</p><p>“I recognize now that the money was hush money,” she said.</p><p>Claire said that she was thankful she had never had to sign a nondisclosure agreement with Mr. Gaiman, which allowed her to share her story.</p><p>“I feel grateful,” she said, “not to be trapped the way I was on that tour bus.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jesus Jiménez covers breaking news, online trends and other subjects.
