But it quickly pared back some of its losses, as investors tried to make sense of the mixed results along with the company’s reassurance that the employee error, which Macy’s said spanned the fourth quarter of 2021 through the most recent quarter, did not affect its cash flow management or vendor payments.</p><p>Macy’s sales in the third quarter fell 2.4 percent — below analysts’ expectations — to $4.74 billion. The company’s overall sales were dragged down by weak performance at Macy’s stores and its digital business.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But sales at 50 locations that represent the company’s future — based on geography, staffing and other factors — rose 1.9 percent, the third consecutive quarter of growth. And comparable sales rose at both Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury, the company’s luxury brands. Those results are early signs that Macy’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/business/macys-earnings-strategy.html" title="">latest strategy</a> of investing in these parts of the business may be working.</p><p>Macy’s said it had found the accounting error while preparing its results for the quarter, which ended Nov. 2. The results had been set to be released on Tuesday. An investigation was opened, and the employee, who was responsible for small package delivery expense accounting, is no longer with the company, Macy’s said. The investigation has not identified involvement by any other employee.</p><p>In the same three-year period of the accounting issue in which the employee hid up to $154 million, the retailer said it had recorded about $4.36 billion in delivery expenses — the cost to a business in order to transport goods to customers. Macy’s declined to comment further.</p><p>While amounting to a small percentage of the retailer’s total delivery expenses, the millions of dollars that the employee misstated is comparable to Macy’s total net income in 2023: roughly $105 million. The retailer reported a profit of $150 million for the second quarter of 2024, a figure that fell within the range of the hidden delivery costs.</p><p>The chain said it would report earnings by Dec. 11.</p><p>Neil Saunders, managing director at the retail consulting firm GlobalData, said the delay in the results was “not a good look.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“While Macy’s cannot control the actions of every employee, it is worrying that these are intentional accounting errors that go back to 2021,” Mr. Saunders said in a statement. “Such things create more nervousness for investors who are already concerned about the company’s performance.”</p><p>As part of a turnaround plan announced in February, Macy’s said it would close 150 of its stores over the next three years. The company said it had recorded asset gains of $66 million from the sale of closed stores. That was more than the company had expected.</p><p>Macy’s decision to delay its full-year guidance added to uncertainty about winners and losers in the upcoming holiday shopping season. U.S. consumers are still spending, but executives at some of the biggest retailers, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/business/target-earnings-holiday-shopping.html" title="">including Target</a>, have recently flagged shoppers’ continuing cautious spending patterns, with many trading down to lower-priced items. The National Retail Federation projected U.S. holiday sales to grow as much as 3.5 percent this year, in line with averages before the pandemic.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jordyn Holman is a business reporter for The Times, covering the retail industry and consumer behavior.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jordyn-holman">More about Jordyn Holman</a></span></p></div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Bluesky’s Rapid Growth: </strong>The fledgling social media platform, an alternative to X and Facebook, has been flooded with new users since the election. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/technology/bluesky-growing-pains.html">It hasn’t all been easy</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Table Tennis Olympian’s Broken Promises: </strong>Michael Hyatt used his charisma to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/business/michael-hyatt-table-tennis-fraud.html">persuade a string of women to open up their homes and wallets</a>, leaving them disillusioned, bitter and in debt.</p></li><li><p><strong>Substack’s Political Experiment: </strong>The newsletter start-up, which once drew an overture from Elon Musk, is betting on politics content and recruiting stars. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/business/media/substack-politics-newsletters.html">But profits remain elusive</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Cost of Late-in-Life Divorce:</strong> As the number of couples who split after the age of 50 rises, more Americans are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/business/divorce-retirement-savings.html">looking at a retirement that is drastically different</a> than they had expected.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Rise of Niche Streamers:</strong> The streaming wars didn’t kill smaller streaming services like Hallmark+ and BritBox. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/business/media/hallmark-britbox-streaming-growth.html">In fact, they’re thriving</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
