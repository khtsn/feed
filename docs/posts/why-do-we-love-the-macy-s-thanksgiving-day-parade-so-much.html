A totally captive audience, on a day millions of people stay home, certainly helps. So does its role kick-starting a holiday season when people are (generally) in a good mood. The element of a live production — Will it rain? Will it freeze? Will it be too windy for the balloons? — provides a jolt of unpredictability.</p><p>There also seems to be a deep well of nostalgia for a production that, more or less, looks roughly the same year after year: lots of floats, plenty of balloons, a dozen or so performances, the same opening act (the Tom Turkey float) and the same kicker (Santa).</p><p>“Those iconic moments have been part of our history and legacy since the earliest days,” said Will Coss, an executive producer of the parade. “We’re intentional about that. We care about that.”</p><p>Over more than three hours, each segment of the telecast rotates through five to 10 minutes of performances before heading into the next commercial break. The segments are “perfect for our social media-trained brains,” said Sarah Unger, a founder of Cultique, a consulting firm that advises companies on changing cultural norms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“No segment is too long, and there’s spectacle in spades,” she said.</p><p>That is not an accident.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The parade will draw more viewers than the Oscars, the Yankees-Dodgers World Series or the Times Square New Year’s Eve telecast.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Hamja/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“The great thing about the parade is that there are so many elements, there’s something for every viewer,” said Bill Bracken, a producer of the telecast for more than 30 years. “It’s something we explain in our ‘coming up’ bumpers. Let people know, ‘Hey, maybe this wasn’t your favorite, but coming up next is <em>this</em>.’”</p><p>Nor is it afflicted with any political baggage. When award show ratings began cratering, some television executives blamed preachy political monologues and acceptance speeches for turning off swaths of Middle America. A viewer of the parade, on the other hand, could be forgiven for forgetting that presidential elections exist, or even what year it is.</p><p>“It kind of sits outside of time and culture — it’s like this stand-alone thing,” Ms. Unger said. “It’s separate from all the entertainment industry woes and the culture wars. It’s like going into an alternate universe.”</p><p>Producers of the show have long tried to appeal to a wide audience. Performances from Broadway shows are intended, in part, for families that “don’t have the opportunity to visit New York,” Ms. Neal, the NBC executive, said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>And the steady procession of high school and college marching bands from states like West Virginia, South Dakota, Arkansas and Texas also adds “that slice of America straight out of the heartland that we really, really want to make it a truly national event,” Savannah Guthrie, the “Today” anchor who hosts the telecast, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqeYR7GDne4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">once said</a> in a retrospective about the parade.</p><p>(Mr. Bracken, the producer, said that, in the past, the telecast had gleefully highlighted when band members had taken a plane for the first time to participate in the parade.)</p><p>The ratings are evenly distributed across the country. Over the last two years, liberal enclaves like New York, Baltimore and New Haven are among the highest rated local markets for the parade, but so are major markets in dependably red states like Indiana, Florida, Ohio and Missouri.</p><p>The across-the-board appeal is of high interest to advertisers. Last year, NBC charged sponsors an average of $865,000 for 30 seconds of commercial time, and this year it’s charging nearly $900,000, according to Guideline, an advertising data firm. That’s a higher rate than most live entertainment events, including the Grammy Awards, the Emmys, “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve” or the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting, Guideline said. Only the Oscars command a bigger ad rate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Last year, when viewership from an encore telecast and the Peacock streaming service was tallied up, the parade audience ballooned to over 28 million viewers, a new high.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Macy’s and NBC are in negotiations about a new contract for broadcast rights for the parade. The amount that NBC pays Macy’s to televise the event is expected to go up, according to a person familiar with the talks. The Wall Street Journal previously reported on the discussions.</p><p>And a higher rights fee is no surprise given the parade’s ascent.</p><p>“It’s entertainment doing exactly what entertainment is supposed to do,” Ms. Unger said. “It’s uniting, it’s escapist, it’s easy to access.
