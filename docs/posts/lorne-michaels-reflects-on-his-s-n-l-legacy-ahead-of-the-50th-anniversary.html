Night Live,” all the extra attention it has brought him, has been a bit much.</p><p>“I say this not with any sense of modesty — I was famous enough,” Michaels said recently at Orso, one of his favorite New York haunts. Someone who knew him once sardonically suggested Michaels would like to have “LEGENDARY” stitched into his underwear. And he is, after all, known in some circles by one name, like Beyoncé, Cher, Ichiro. But Michaels demurs.</p><p>“Everybody who had to know me, knew me,” he said. “I wasn’t in the public eye. But now, walking over here, a young comedian came up and said, ‘How would I audition?’”</p><p>I said I would have loved to have seen that encounter.</p><p>“You would <em>not</em> love that,” he said in his bone-dry voice and signature cadence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Since the 50th season <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/arts/television/snl-recap-maya-rudolph-jim-gaffigan-dana-carvey.html" title="">premiered last fall</a>, the anniversary of “S.N.L.,” one of a fragmented America’s few remaining communal cultural events, has inspired a steady stream of tributes to the show and its creator. There was a Jason Reitman origin-story movie called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/movies/saturday-night-review.html" title="">“Saturday Night,”</a> as well as hundreds of feature stories and listicles in the press. Last month there was a four-part docuseries on the show and another documentary on just the music. Friday night brings an “S.N.L” concert at Radio City Music Hall, livestreaming on Peacock. A 600-plus page biography of Michaels titled “Lorne,” by Susan Morrison, an editor at The New Yorker, comes out next week.</p><p>It all culminates on Sunday with a live three-hour prime-time special looking back on “S.N.L.” and its singular legacy. Like a Veterans Day parade with troops from different wars marching by, “S.N.L.” stars from different decades, among many other celebrities young and old — guests include Paul McCartney, Robert De Niro, Steve Martin, Sabrina Carpenter, Tom Hanks, Kim Kardashian and Dave Chappelle<strong> </strong>— are swirling around New York, ready to help Michaels celebrate the golden anniversary.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/16/multimedia/16lorne-michaels-1979-vfqj/16lorne-michaels-1979-vfqj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/16/multimedia/16lorne-michaels-1979-vfqj/16lorne-michaels-1979-vfqj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/16/multimedia/16lorne-michaels-1979-vfqj/16lorne-michaels-1979-vfqj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Lorne Michaels in a black and white photo in a studio next to a director’s chair that reads “Lorne Michaels”" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/16/multimedia/16lorne-michaels-1979-vfqj/16lorne-michaels-1979-vfqj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/16/multimedia/16lorne-michaels-1979-vfqj/16lorne-michaels-1979-vfqj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/16/multimedia/16lorne-michaels-1979-vfqj/16lorne-michaels-1979-vfqj-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 680w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/16/multimedia/16lorne-michaels-1979-vfqj/16lorne-michaels-1979-vfqj-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1359w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/f3f92a56-3048-56e9-8244-3a32d7a1dd00" decoding="async" width="600" height="905"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Michaels in 1979. “Saturday Night Live” debuted in October 1975 and will celebrate its 50th anniversary with a prime-time special on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fred Hermansky/NBC Universal, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At 80, Michaels is a unique, towering figure who has shaped comedy for half a century, turning the Art Deco tower at 30 Rockefeller Plaza into a portal for comedy stars on prime-time TV, in the movies, and on late-night shows. It’s hard to think of someone in comedy who <em>hasn’t </em>been touched by Michaels’s magic wand. When he started in the business, he worked with former radio stars; now he is going viral with young viewers who don’t watch the show live or even on a television.</p><p>“Without any hyperbole here, I honestly think that Lorne is the most important and influential person in the history of television, including Johnny Carson and Ed Sullivan,” said Ted Sarandos, the Netflix chief executive, who is a comedy buff and loves to catch “S.N.L.” shows in person.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Michaels said he hadn’t seen or read anything of the anniversary coverage except the documentary about the history of music on “S.N.L.,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/arts/television/questlove-snl-music-documentary.html" title="">directed by Questlove</a>.</p><p>“Only because something in it will hurt my feelings, and I’m on that thing now where I just have to get the show on,” confessed the man famous for his stoic mien. He asked Tina Fey to watch the show’s 40th anniversary extravaganza, from 2015, because he remembered it as being perfect, and he didn’t want to be disillusioned if it wasn’t. Fey watched and assured him that it was perfect, which caused him to worry that he couldn’t reach that level again.</p><p>“There’s going to be a lot of emotional things of seeing people who I last saw when they were 25,” he said. He recalled an encounter two years ago, after the Los Angeles premiere of Fey’s “Mean Girls” musical, one of the scores of “S.N.L.” alumni projects he has produced. At the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/us/california-today-musso-frank-grill.html" title="">Musso &amp; Frank Grill</a>, he was told that the 86-year-old <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/saturday-night-live-garrett-morris" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Garrett Morris</a>, one of the original Not Ready for Prime Time Players, was at another table. Morris came over and “we embraced for a long time,” Michaels said. “We were holding each other because we were in the trenches.”</p><p>After five decades of “S.N.L.,” Michaels is still in something like the trenches, scouting new talent and producing the show each week. But while a glittery all-star retrospective might seem like a good way to close out a career — and while <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lorne-michaels-saturday-night-live-kennedy-center-honors/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michaels himself once suggested</a> he might quit after 50 seasons — he now says he has no plans to abandon his favorite spot beneath the bleachers of Studio 8H, the stage Hanks calls “the sacred temple.”</p><p>“I may be wrong,” Michaels said. “But I don’t feel I’m done.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Michaels advises cast members to find a drop of humanity in the people they impersonate, even if they don’t like them. “In order for your character to work, you have to like the character,” he said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Arnold for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-22a00a23">‘He is aware of his own Lorne-ness’</h2><p>Michaels is known to the public mostly from his deadpan cameos on his show. But in person, he has, as Scarlett Johansson put it, “a Lorne glint in his eyes, a sparkle.” The glint was there at Orso as he showed me a video text he had just gotten from Jon Lovitz, who for some reason was at Mar-a-Lago (unless, like his famous “S.N.L.” character <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLRKhdQnd-k" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tommy Flanagan</a>, he was lying).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>As Michaels dug into his rigatoni, I asked him: Was there ever someone he really wanted to host that he couldn’t get?</p><p>“Gilda was a huge Clint Eastwood fan,” he said. “We offered it to him. He didn’t do it.”</p><p>“Saturday Night Live” has persevered from the days of analog videotape to the streaming age, through 10 different White Houses, from baby boomers to Gen Alpha, amusing (sometimes) at least five generations despite changing tastes in humor. Michaels has often joked that the word he most often sees in reviews — “uneven” — will be engraved on his tombstone.</p><p>Those who have worked closely with Michaels say his greatest gift is spotting raw talent. Adam McKay, the acclaimed filmmaker who was a head writer at S.N.L. in the ’90s, recalled a telling story Lorne once shared about a trip abroad:</p><p>“He saw a guy with a little table and chair who’s selling watermelons and Lorne can’t resist. He goes over to the guy and says: ‘I’m surrounded by a million watermelons. Why would I come to this table?’</p><p>“And the guys says, ‘For my eye.’”</p><p>After watching S.N.L. auditions with his boss, McKay realized that “Lorne’s eye is his superpower.” He added: “He has had a remarkable run of choosing people that no one else was choosing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Michaels backstage at the show’s 40th anniversary special in 2015.

It was a long road to being a sophisticate for the son of a Toronto furrier. When he first arrived in New York and was invited to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/nyregion/city-lore-when-work-was-the-curse-of-the-drinking-class.html" title="">the Astor Bar</a>, the waiter asked if he wanted a cocktail. “The only cocktail I’d ever heard of was a shrimp cocktail so I said, ‘Yes, I’d like a shrimp cocktail,’” Michaels recalled.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In Los Angeles, Michaels wrote jokes for Woody Allen briefly, worked on “Laugh-In,” “The Beautiful Phyllis Diller Show,” “The Perry Como Winter Show” and did award-winning specials with Lily Tomlin. There were some brushes with failure; he toggled between two residences at the Chateau Marmont, a $580-a-month room when he was flush and a $220-a-month one when he was broke.</p><p>It’s been a long time since Michaels was broke. “S.N.L.” debuted in October 1975 and quickly became America’s most reliable generator of comic stars. The soignée executive producer’s tentacles now reach everywhere: He produces Jimmy Fallon’s “Tonight Show” and Seth Meyers’s “Late Night.” He was a producer of Fey’s “30 Rock,” a sitcom based on “S.N.L.,” and of her hit movie “Mean Girls.” He was a producer of “Wayne’s World” with Dana Carvey and Mike Myers, “Tommy Boy” with Chris Farley and David Spade. Fred Armisen’s “Portlandia,” Kenan Thompson’s “Kenan.” And on and on.</p><p>He has always worked very long hours, but he models himself on Fred Astaire, who didn’t grunt when he danced. In years past, some at “S.N.L.” whinged that Michaels swanned around town to dinners with his famous friends, leaving his writers and cast to work stuff out. As his friend Mitch Glazer once wrote, John Belushi’s imitation of the boss was picking up the phone in Michaels’s office and saying, in a Canadian accent: “Hello, Elaine’s? Yes, I’d like the usual table for Saturday night, say 11-ish.”</p><p>Over the years, Michaels’s acolytes have enshrined his image in the popular culture. Myers infused Dr. Evil in the “Austin Powers” franchise with Michaels’s unusual accent and mannerisms; Fey gave the “30 Rock” boss, Alec Baldwin’s Jack Donaghy, some of Lorne’s style, making him the kind of guy, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2013/01/25/170166424/alec-baldwin-bids-goodbye-to-jack-donaghy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as Baldwin said</a>, who would keep his tuxedo at the ready in the glove compartment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From left, Chevy Chase, Michaels, Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi and then-President Gerald Ford in 1976. “S.N.L.” quickly became America’s most reliable generator of comic stars.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fred Hermansky/NBC Universal, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Michaels occupies an outsize proportion of his stars’ psyches; some are scared of him. For decades, an anxious question has reverberated in therapists’ offices from Manhattan to Hollywood: “Does Lorne <em>like </em>me?”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>This is partly owed to his management style. Michaels is an oxymoron: a comedy legend known by the public for his unsmiling face. Leading a cast and writers’ room riddled with neuroses, his poker face and minimalist reactions have often left a trail of insecure young comedians on edge.</p><p><a href="https://www.cracked.com/article_40207_79-brutal-takedowns-of-lorne-michaels-for-his-79th-birthday.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Some former cast members have said</a> Michaels created a kind of royal-court culture prone to petty jealousies. He likes the arch description supplied by his late friend William Shawn, who teased Michaels about the “pseudo-egalitarian” culture on his show. (Michaels gave the longtime New Yorker executive editor an office to work in after he was pushed out of the magazine at 79.)</p><p>But his vision for the show is supreme. Hanks, who has hosted “S.N.L.” 10 times, told me Michaels brings “the grand omnipotent overview” that “takes it from this thing that is almost working to this thing that does work.”</p><p>Michaels is nonconfrontational and not prone to gushing. The actor Bob Odenkirk, a former S.N.L. writer, called Michaels a “distant, strange comedy god.” Mike Myers said: “He is aware of his own Lorne-ness.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Michaels said he finds it tricky getting close to his writers and performers. “What kind of friend cuts your sketch?” he asked. “That’s the job.

She lost her own father at 18, and “the esteem of a man like that, if you’re lucky enough to earn it, is a very powerful healing thing,” she said. “It’s a very tender relationship.”</p><p>“He wants to create a sense of family,” she added. “Not just within the organization but with the audience as well.”</p><p>Michaels is OK with being the daddy, to a point. He doesn’t want paternal confusion, or to feel as though he were solely responsible for someone’s happiness; he does not want to play therapist in his House of Broken Toys.</p><p>He admitted he finds it tricky getting close to his writers and performers. “What kind of friend cuts your sketch?” he asked. “That’s the job. I’m going to put the show first.”</p><h2 id="link-344223c8">‘You have to like the character’</h2><p>Michaels still runs “Saturday Night Live” much the way he’s always run it — the table reads, the hand-lettered cue cards, the after-parties full of “S.N.L.” stars past and present. At the party following the Timothée Chalamet show last month, at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/dining/four-seasons-the-grill-restaurant.html" title="">the Grill</a> in the Seagram Building, Adam Sandler — who appeared on-air to give a very Sandleresque introduction to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/arts/music/timothee-chalamet-bob-dylan-snl.html" title="">Chalamet musical performance</a> — asked to trade places with me so he could slide into a booth and talk to Michaels, his old mentor.</p><p>The job has gotten more complicated, however, since Donald Trump arrived on the national political scene, beginning with Michaels’s decision to let Trump host in 2015.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>I happened to be there that night, when then-candidate Trump got the most laughs in one sketch by gamely <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeORm4LMDk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dancing to Drake’s “Hotline Bling,”</a> a precursor to his “Y.M.C.A.” rally dance. The mood at that after-party was very strange. Some in the cast were furious, believing that the gig could help Trump become president. In 2017, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fellendurney%2Fsnl-uproar-over-donald-trump-2015-hosting-gig&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeadline.com%2F2017%2F10%2Ftaran-killam-donald-trump-snl-hosting-npr-embarrassing-and-shameful-1202190228%2F&amp;xcust=7827302%7C0%7CRSS%7C58504720&amp;xs=1&amp;uuid=hDhYP0Qswkx0cBhh9300" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Taran Killam</a>, a former cast member who sometimes played Trump, told N.P.R. that the Trump episode is “something that only grows more embarrassing and shameful as time goes on.”</p><p>But Michaels, sitting at a back table of the restaurant as usual, looked serene that night. I saw a couple of cast members awkwardly come up to tell him that Trump was not such a bad guy; some of them greeted Trump, while others avoided him. Trump himself was euphoric about his performance, sitting at a table with Bill O’Reilly and his family, strolling around the restaurant like a maitre d’.</p><p>Political sensitivities come into play with a largely liberal cast that is expected to satirize both sides of the aisle. Everything is copacetic when Maya Rudolph does a cozy sketch with Kamala Harris on the cusp of the election. As the famed former “S.N.L.” writer Jim Downey told Morrison, the show sometimes seemed like “the comedy division of the D.N.C.”</p><p>After a show in February 2016 in which Larry David, brilliantly playing Senator Bernie Sanders, was joined by the real Sanders, I <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/09/magazine/is-the-2016-election-beyond-satire-ask-lorne-michaels.html" title="">talked to Michaels</a> about the show’s politics.</p><p>“People are always looking for us to be on the side of Clinton, and that’s not what we do,” he told me. “If Trump is ascendant, then we will be discussing that.” He was prescient then about the reality show star, noting that the scorn heaped on him recalled the scorn initially heaped on another entertainer-turned-politician, Ronald Reagan.</p><p>“There’s a smugness to that attitude that causes the voting public to go, ‘We’re smarter than that,’” Michaels said. “Donald’s giving voice to what polite society sort of sat on for a while, things that are felt but that no one is articulating. There is something happening there, or it wouldn’t be resonating.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p>Michaels told me then: “I don’t go along with the idea that the American people can’t make up their own minds and that if you expose them to these things, they will just be swept along.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Comedy is what works,” Michaels said. “When it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work.

He had no patience for the argument of some at the show that democracy was at stake in 2024, so they had to fight against Trump rather than aiming darts at both sides. (This season, he brought back Carvey to play a President Joe Biden befuddled by age, had a cold open mocking MSNBC anchors and ridiculed the Trumps and Bidens in the show’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AafBunu-k2U" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latest parody</a> of “Family Feud.”)</p><p>“We heard, over the last four years, a lot of ‘this is the most consequential election in American history,’” he told me at Orso. “I go, ‘Are we just jumping over Lincoln?’”</p><p>Will Ferrell once worried that his affectionate portrayal of George W. Bush on “S.N.L.” had helped the Texan win the White House. McKinnon, the former cast member who played Hillary Clinton on the show and was a fan, said it was hard when her antipathy toward Trump collided with Michaels’s admonition to avoid preaching to the choir.</p><p>She said that “ultimately I had to take a break” from political sketches, adding: “It has been nice in a way to not be in the pressure cooker of doing political satire in this environment because of how strongly I feel internally about it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Michaels’s theory of the comedy case — mocking all sides — was illustrated with Elon Musk, another controversial choice <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/09/arts/television/elon-musk-snl.html" title="">for host in 2021</a>, whose blunt feedback about skits that he found unfunny <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/chloe-fineman-says-elon-musk-snl-cast-member-made-cry-hosted-show-rcna179703" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made some cast members cry</a>. On the show, Musk talked about how he had “always loved S.N.L.” But in November, when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/arts/television/saturday-night-live-election-bill-burr.html" title="">Carvey unveiled</a> his hilarious impression of Musk hyperactively jumping around the stage and yelling about Dark MAGA, Musk pouted on X: “SNL has been dying slowly for years, as they become increasingly out of touch with reality.”</p><p>Michaels advises cast members to find a drop of humanity in those they regard as blackguards. “In order for your character to work, you have to like the character,” he said. I told Michaels that the show’s current caricature of Trump by James Austin Johnson, who replaced Baldwin in the role, captures the way the president’s wacky humor distracts from his cruel remarks and outlandish actions.</p><p>“I think Alec was the sort of Satanic Trump,” Michaels said. “I think James is somehow a more familiar Trump and maybe slightly diminished. He’s not world-ending every time.”</p><p>Over the years, some critics have wondered if you can be a multimillionaire and run a satirical comedy show that’s supposed to challenge power, particularly in an era dominated by corporate studios and streaming services.</p><p>Michaels shot back on this point to me: “They’ve said this in so many different ways since Season 2. We are a comedy variety show, and each generation has what they think is funny and the music keeps changing as well. And we are still on the air.” He joked: “Our audience is mostly rich now.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><p>Michaels has faced criticism before that he was perhaps too cozy to power. Back in the ’90s, when his superiors at NBC fired Norm Macdonald over Michaels’s objections, David Letterman felt the “S.N.L.” chief should have thrown down the gauntlet. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki6z4ohppbE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">He mocked Michaels on-air</a> as “Mr. Bigshot, Mr. Table-at-Orso’s.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-33"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kate McKinnon, center, with Michaels and Tina Fey in 2018, said that Michaels “wants to create a sense of family, not just within the organization but with the audience as well.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dolly Faibyshev for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>But Michaels has never forgotten the lesson he learned from the Smothers Brothers just before he created “S.N.L.” At the height of their popularity, in 1969, they lost their CBS variety show after fighting the censors and irking the CBS president, Bill Paley. When they tried to make a comeback at the Troubadour in Los Angeles in 1974, Michaels was there with Tomlin and watched a drunk, belligerent <a href="https://americansongwriter.com/remember-when-a-drunk-john-lennon-and-harry-nilsson-were-kicked-out-of-an-l-a-club-for-heckling-the-smothers-brothers/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">John Lennon heckle the brothers</a> from the audience. It taught Michaels to always operate with the big picture in mind, taking care to pick your battles.</p><p>“Don’t be a martyr — Judaism doesn’t celebrate that,” says the man whose given name is Lorne Lipowitz. “Don’t get so carried away that you forget that they’re in power.”</p><h2 id="link-3ea9a148">‘Comedy is what works’</h2><p>As the fizzy countdown to going live at 11:30 p.m. begins in the studio, an expressionless Lorne, in suit and tie, paces amid the moving cameras.</p><p>“What do these guys need cocaine for?” Hanks asked me, laughing. “It’s like the liftoff of the Apollo 13, for crying out loud.”</p><p>The scandalous days when “S.N.L.” stars fueled up on liquor and coke, when drug dealers with hand-tooled leather bags roamed the halls, are long gone. (As Michaels told Marc Maron on a podcast, “It’s a small point of pride that nobody has ever died <em>doing </em>the show.”) Now, cast members are more likely to shoot up Ozempic, as Morrison notes in her book, and their powder of choice is Emergen-C.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>Sensitivities have changed too. The anniversary specials and the show’s hugely popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqFzWxSCi39LnW1JKFR3efg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube feed</a> leave out old clips that haven’t aged well, like Morris’s “News for the Hard of Hearing” and Belushi’s Samurai sketches. But Michaels does not think, as some comedians claim, that woke broke comedy.</p><p>“Comedy is what works,” he said. “When it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work. There’s evidence, because no one is laughing.”</p><p>After doing mushrooms and cocaine in his salad days, Michaels gradually gave up his vices, including marijuana and cigarettes. (That’s why he always has a basket of popcorn and a bowl of Tootsie Rolls in his office.)</p><p>A couple of years ago, he decided to give up alcohol, too. He sips nonalcoholic beer now in a room under the bleachers with a monitor on Saturday nights. (Steven Spielberg, Sandler and Lin-Manuel Miranda dropped by the small space for the Chalamet show, in which Miranda reprised his “Hamilton” role at the top.)</p><p>“I was just watching my friends make the transition to another zone,” he said mordantly about dying. “I went, ‘Uh huh.’ I’d like to die with all my original parts. I’d also like to maintain this energy level as long as I can.”</p><p>Certainly, Michaels looks as sharp as he did when I first met him two decades ago. At dinner, he was wearing his Rolex and Fitbit, a crisp white Oxford shirt, gray slacks and a 20-year-old pair of suede Gucci loafers. I asked him how he relaxes now, without his old chemical helpers. He said he walks, five miles at a clip, and reads voraciously.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-19"><div><p>“It’s the only way to shut down for me,” he said. “Particularly after you stop smoking pot.”</p><p>In addition to his house in the Hamptons and Upper West Side apartment in Manhattan, he bought a farm near the water on the Eastern tip of Maine, where blueberries grow and cheese is made. He now gives staff — including the Lornettes, as his assistants have long been known — jam and blueberries for Christmas. He likes to take friends up to his place to walk through the remote forest.</p><p>Armisen said, “You think he’s a city guy, but we’ve done all these walks in nature.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-39"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Michaels once suggested he might quit after 50 seasons, but he has changed his mind. “I may be wrong,” he said. “But I don’t feel I’m done.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Arnold for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-20"><div><p>Michaels has been married three times; he wed his current wife, Alice Barry, a former assistant, in 1991. They have three grown children: Henry, a writer; Eddie, who works for his father’s company; and Sophie, a willowy blond Yale grad who worked as a talent coordinator at “S.N.L.” and is headed off to business school. At the Chalamet after-party, she sat next to her father in his back booth.</p><p>Although there has been chatter about successors — Fey could “easily” do it, <a href="https://www.etonline.com/media/videos/lorne-michaels-says-tina-fey-could-easily-be-his-snl-successor-exclusive-218001" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he has said</a>, and Meyers and Colin Jost are also possibilities — the reigning king is not currently considering abdicating.</p><p>I asked him if he wants the show to finish in suttee, the ritual in which a Hindu wife is immolated upon her husband’s funeral pyre. Would he prefer that “S.N.L.” end with him? “I’m not that guy,” he said with a smile.</p><p>I asked Michaels how it feels to have so many big names obsess on him as a mythic figure — talking to their shrinks about him, jabbering about him at dinners, trying to fathom what’s behind that inscrutable mask, trying to figure out where they stand with him.</p><p>He looked bemused. “I am, in most instances, a benign force,” he said. “Nevertheless, that’s more when you look back at it than when you’re living through it.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maureen Dowd is an Opinion columnist for The Times.
