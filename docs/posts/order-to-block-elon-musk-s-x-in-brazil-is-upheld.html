Justice Moraes has said Mr. Musk is illegally obstructing his work to clean up the Brazilian internet and remove hate speech and attacks on democracy, while Mr. Musk says Justice Moraes is censoring free speech.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Monday’s vote was an important affirmation of the ban because Mr. Musk has criticized the action against his company as an abuse of power by a single, crusading judge. The panel’s ruling on Monday shows that four other Brazilian justices side with their colleague.</p><p>The vote gives the ban firmer legal standing, but it is likely to still head to the full court for a vote by all 11 justices. The court sometimes uses such panel votes to get a swifter review of important orders issued by single justices. Justice Moraes was one of the five justices on the panel that voted Monday.</p><p>Justice Moraes said he blocked X because the company lacked a physical presence in Brazil. Mr. Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/world/americas/elon-musk-x-brazil.html" title="">closed X’s office</a> in the country last month, after Justice Moraes threatened arrests for not complying with his orders to suspend certain X accounts. On Saturday, X began publishing some of Justice Moraes’ sealed orders, which did not appear to include explanations on why he was ordering those accounts to be suspended.</p><p>In his vote, Justice Dino compared Mr. Musk’s refusal to comply with court orders to suspend accounts to the operator of a private highway refusing to stop traffic to prevent the escape of a dangerous criminal. “Would it be reasonable for this company to choose whether or not to comply with the court order, arguing that stopping the highway would violate the criminal’s freedom of movement?” he asked.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Starlink satellite internet antenna in a village of the Marubo Indigenous people in Brazil.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor Moriyama for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>There were some signs of discomfort with one part of Justice Moraes’s order: the threat to impose hefty fines on people in Brazil who employed common privacy software called virtual private networks, or VPNs, to circumvent the ban and use X.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Justice Luiz Fux said that people should not be fined unless they are using X to spread “racism, fascism or Nazism, obstruct criminal investigations or incite crimes in general.” He added that he might not vote in support of the order if it goes to the full court.</p><p>Justice Moraes has slightly amended his order to add that people would face fines if they employed VPNs to use X and “engage in conduct that defrauds the court decision.” It is unclear how that would affect enforcement.</p><p>Justice Moraes has become perhaps Brazil’s most polarizing figure as he has undertaken a sweeping crackdown on vitriol on the internet, ordering social networks to remove thousands of posts over the last several years. Lawyers and academics have been split over his approach, but in recent days, even some of his defenders have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/world/americas/brazil-x-ban-free-speech.html" title="">criticized his proposal</a> to fine people nearly $9,000 a day, or more than what the average Brazilian earns in a year, if they used VPNs to get around the ban.</p><p>Mr. Musk has continued to defy the Brazilian authorities. On Monday, he posted a string of criticisms of Justice Moraes, including a call for his imprisonment, and encouraged Brazilians to use VPNs to keep using X.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Starlink, the satellite-internet service controlled by Mr. Musk, is also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/world/americas/elon-musk-brazil-starlink-x.html" title="">refusing to comply with the order to block X</a> in Brazil. Brazilian regulators said that Starlink told them on Sunday that it would not block the social network for its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/02/world/americas/starlink-internet-elon-musk-brazil-amazon.html" title="">250,000 customers</a> in Brazil unless Brazilian officials unfroze its assets. Justice Moraes blocked Starlink from making transactions in Brazil in a bid to collect on more than $3 million in fines he has issued against X, saying that the two companies are linked.</p><p>Mr. Musk and Starlink have called that move illegal and said the service would offer connectivity to its Brazilian customers for free until it can process transactions in the country again. Another Supreme Court justice blocked a petition from Starlink on Friday to overturn the sanctions.</p><p>Mr. Musk said he owns 40 percent of SpaceX, the private space company that runs Starlink. He controls the company by holding a majority of its voting shares.</p><p>By Monday afternoon in Brazil, as most internet providers had blocked X, the social network was still accessible using a Starlink connection.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-9"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Paulo Motoryn<!-- --> contributed reporting from Brasília.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jack Nicas is the Brazil bureau chief for The Times, based in Rio de Janeiro, where he leads coverage of much of South America.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jack-nicas">More about Jack Nicas</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/alexandre-de-moraes">Alexandre de Moraes</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The World of Elon Musk</h2><h3>The billionaire’s portfolio includes the world’s most valuable automaker, an innovative rocket company and plenty of drama.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Brazil’s Ban on X: </strong>Starlink, the satellite internet service controlled by Elon Musk, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/world/americas/elon-musk-brazil-starlink-x.html">refusing to comply</a> with an order from Brazil’s Supreme Court to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/world/americas/brazil-elon-musk-x-blocked.html">block the social network</a> in the country.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tesla’s Superchargers: </strong>Musk’s plan to open Tesla’s well-regarded charging network to electric vehicles from other carmakers is proceeding slowly. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/business/energy-environment/tesla-electric-vehicle-charging.html">Nobody is entirely sure why</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Twitter Blue’s Chaotic Revamp: </strong>The overhaul of the subscription service that lets users buy verified badges was the first big test for Musk as the platform’s new owner. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/technology/elon-musk-twitter-blue.html">It didn’t go well</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Leaving San Francisco: </strong>X, founded in San Francisco as Twitter, is moving its headquarters to Texas as a shadow of its former self. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/technology/elon-musk-x-san-francisco.html">City officials are far from heartbroken</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Musk’s Trump Talk on X: </strong>Problems in the livestream of Musk’s chat with Donald Trump renewed questions about X’s ability to handle big events, but it also showed how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/technology/elon-musk-x-donald-trump.html">the platform can still grab attention</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
