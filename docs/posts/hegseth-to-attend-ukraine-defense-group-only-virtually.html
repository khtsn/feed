But cease-fire negotiations with Washington, Kyiv and Moscow <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/world/europe/russia-ukraine-us-peace-talks.html" title="">have failed to yield</a> an end to fighting that has led to the deaths of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-soldiers-loss.html" title="">an estimated</a> 100,000 Ukrainian and 150,000 Russian soldiers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>U.S. leadership of the contact group had provided a lifeline of arms and materiel for Ukraine’s armed forces, but the flow of goods has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/trump-ukraine-weapons.html?smid=url-share" title="">largely petered out</a> since Mr. Trump’s second inauguration.</p><p>Ukraine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/world/americas/ukraine-us-weapons-suspension.html" title="">particularly needs</a> air-defense munitions, such as the Patriot missiles the United States previously shipped. That was brought into sharp focus last week when a Russian missile attack in central Ukraine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/europe/ukraine-kryvyi-ri-attack.html" title="">struck near a playground</a>, killing 19 civilians, including nine children.</p><p>Mr. Hegseth handed leadership of the contact group to Britain before its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/world/europe/nato-ukraine-war-eu.html" title="">last meeting</a>, held on Feb. 12. Britain’s defense secretary, John Healey, is now the chairman.</p><p>The Pentagon has referred questions about the contact group to the British Defense Ministry, which has not responded to repeated requests for comment on whether Mr. Hegseth will speak at Friday’s meeting.</p><p>Mr. Hegseth’s predecessor, Lloyd J. Austin III, said goodbye to the organization in January during its 26th meeting at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. He had spent years offering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/29/world/europe/us-ukraine-military-war-wiesbaden.html" title="">military advice</a> to the group based on his decades of combat leadership, which included multiple command tours as a general in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The coalition to support Ukraine must not flinch,” Mr. Austin said in his closing remarks at the summit. “It must not falter. And it must not fail. Ukraine’s survival is on the line. But so is all of our security.”</p><p>Mr. Austin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/04/26/world/ukraine-russia-war-news/allies-will-keep-moving-heaven-and-earth-to-supply-ukraine-the-us-defense-chief-says" title="">created the group</a> just two months after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/politics/ukraine-russia-weapons-coalition.html" title="">became a potent tool</a> for supporting Kyiv.</p><p>At the gathering in January, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/politics/with-trump-arriving-zelensky-urges-allies-not-to-drop-the-ball-now.html" title="">implored the group</a> to “not drop the ball now” when it came to supporting his nation in the form of weapons and other kinds of military hardware.</p><p>The Biden administration approved 74 packages of military aid for Ukraine drawn from the Pentagon’s stockpile and worth more than $34 billion. Ukraine received roughly the same amount of U.S. funding to purchase military hardware directly from American defense firms.</p><p>The Trump administration has not announced any new aid for Ukraine since Inauguration Day, even though roughly $3.85 billion remains untapped, according to the Pentagon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The lack of new military support is not the only way the Trump administration has frozen Ukraine out.</p><p>According to Pentagon statements, Mr. Hegseth has spoken privately or met with leaders from 16 nations since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/24/us/pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-vote" title="">taking office</a>. He spoke briefly with Ukrainian officials at the contact group’s January meeting, but is not otherwise known to have spoken or met with any representatives from the government or military in Kyiv.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Ismay is a reporter covering the Pentagon for The Times.
