The United States is heavily dependent on semiconductors from Taiwan and elsewhere in Asia, a reliance that Democrats and Republicans alike have described as a major national security risk.</p><p>Mr. Trump has argued that the tariffs would encourage companies to produce more chips domestically, though some critics have questioned how effective tariffs would be at relocating an industry largely centered in Asia.</p><p>Speaking Sunday night from Air Force One, the president said tariffs on electronics would “be announced very soon,” but suggested there might be room for exemptions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We’ll also talk to companies,” the president said. “You know, you have to show a certain flexibility. Nobody should be so rigid. We have to have a certain flexibility.”</p><p>The measures would come after Mr. Trump abruptly changed course on taxing electronic imports in recent days.</p><p>Amid a spat with China, Mr. Trump last week raised tariffs on Chinese imports to an eye-watering minimum of 145 percent, before exempting smartphones, laptops, TVs and other electronics on Friday. Those goods make up about a quarter of U.S. imports from China.</p><p>The administration argued that the move was simply a “clarification,” saying those electronics would be included within the scope of the national security investigation on chips.</p><p>But industry executives and analysts have questioned whether the administration’s real motivation might have been to avoid a backlash tied to a sharp increase in prices for many consumer electronics — or to help tech companies like Apple that have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/us/politics/trump-tariffs-china-chips-technology.html" title="">reached out to the White House</a> in recent days to argue that the tariffs would harm them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Trump has abruptly raised and lowered many tariff rates over the past week, roiling financial markets and changing the stakes for companies globally. The president announced a program of global, “reciprocal” tariffs on April 2, including high levies on countries that make many electronics, like Vietnam. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-tariff-pause-be-cool.html" title="">after turmoil in the bond market</a>, he paused those global tariffs for 90 days so his government could carry out trade negotiations with other countries.</p><p>Those import taxes came in addition to other tariffs Mr. Trump has put on a variety of sectors and countries, including a 10 percent tariff on all U.S. imports, a 25 percent tariff on steel, aluminum and cars, and a 25 percent tariff on many goods from Canada and Mexico. Altogether, the moves have increased U.S. tariffs to levels not seen in over a century.</p><p>The semiconductor tariffs would be issued under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the president to impose tariffs to protect U.S. national security. The president has already used that legal authority to issue tariffs on imported steel, aluminum and automobiles. The administration is also using the authority to carry out investigations into imports of lumber and copper, and is expected to begin an inquiry into pharmaceuticals soon.</p><p>Mr. Trump has argued that tariffs on chips will force companies to relocate their factories to the United States. But some critics have questioned how much tariffs will really help to bolster the U.S. industry, given that the Trump administration is also threatening to pull back on grants given to chip factories by the Biden administration. And foreign governments like China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan all subsidize semiconductor manufacturing heavily with tools like grants and tax breaks.</p><p>Globally, 105 new chip factories, or fabs, are set to come online through 2028, according to data compiled by SEMI, an association of global semiconductor suppliers. Fifteen of those are planned for the United States, while the bulk are in Asia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Trump has criticized the CHIPS Act, a $50 billion program administered by the Biden administration and aimed at offering incentives for chip manufacturing in the United States. Mr. Trump has called the grants a waste of money and insisted that tariffs alone are enough to encourage chip companies to produce in the United States.</p><p>Some tech companies have been responsive to the president’s requests to build more in the United States. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s largest chip manufacturer, announced at the White House in March that it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/technology/tsmc-investment-trump.html" title="">spend $100 billion</a> in the United States over the next four years to expand its production capacity.</p><p>On Monday, Nvidia announced that it would produce supercomputers for artificial intelligence made entirely in the United States. In the next four years, the company would produce up to $500 billion of A.I. infrastructure in the United States in partnership with TSMC and other companies, it said.</p><p>“The engines of the world’s A.I. infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, said in a statement.</p><p>Tony Romm<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ana Swanson covers trade and international economics for The Times and is based in Washington.
