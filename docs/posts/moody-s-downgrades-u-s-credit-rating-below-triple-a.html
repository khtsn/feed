It found that Democrats and Republicans alike had failed to meaningfully curtail rising U.S. debt, which now towers above $36 trillion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Nor had the U.S. government tended to myriad well-known, and long-term, financial challenges, Moody’s said, especially the rising costs and persistent underfunding of programs like Social Security and Medicare.</p><p>While Moody’s described the U.S. financial system as stable, and found the dollar to be strong and reliable, it also acknowledged the vast policy uncertainty — and it obliquely referred to the ways in which political stability and constitutional order can be “tested at times.”</p><p>“Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,” the report from Moody’s said. “We do not believe that material multiyear reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration.”</p><p>Moody’s specifically referred to the Republican push to renew the tax cuts adopted under Mr. Trump in 2017, estimating that an extension would add $4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. </p><p>Still, even with the lower assessments from the rating agencies, investors are likely to snap up the American government’s debt. That’s a reflection of the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency, meaning people from all over the world want to stash their savings in U.S. Treasury bonds even as the government accrues more and more debt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The decision from Moody’s comes as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/house-republicans-policy-bil.html" title="">Republicans struggle to agree</a> to a sprawling fiscal package cutting taxes and reducing spending, with the effort briefly stalling on Friday as some hard-right conservatives demanded steeper spending cuts.</p><p>Even with cuts to Medicaid and food stamps that could strip benefits from millions of poorer Americans, Republicans are still not expected to cover anywhere near the $3.8 trillion cost of the tax cut they have prepared. The Trump administration’s blitz to fire much of the federal work force and unilaterally withhold spending has also not generated significant savings.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tony Romm is a reporter covering economic policy and the Trump administration for The Times, based in Washington.</p></div><div><p>Andrew Duehren covers tax policy for The Times from Washington.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’:</strong> The domestic policy bill that would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/us/politics/house-gop-tax-bill-trump.html">deliver Trump’s agenda includes</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/us/politics/house-gop-tax-bill-trump.html"><strong> </strong></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/us/politics/house-gop-tax-bill-trump.html">a large tax cut,</a> as well as more money for defense and immigration enforcement.
