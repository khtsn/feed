But he was unable to bring charges related to a cache of photos found on the officer’s work computer featuring lurid images of minors created by artificial intelligence. When the computer was seized, in November, creating digital fakes was not yet considered a crime.</p><p>Since then, a <a href="https://www.palegis.us/statutes/unconsolidated/law-information/view-statute?txtType=PDF&amp;SessYr=2024&amp;ActNum=0125.&amp;SessInd=0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statewide ban</a> on such content has taken effect. While it came too late to apply to the police officer’s case, the state’s attorney general, Dave Sunday, has already used the law to charge <a href="https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/ag-sundays-child-predator-unit-files-its-first-a-i-involved-child-sexual-abuse-material-charge-since-passing-of-new-pa-law/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">another man</a> who was accused of having 29 files of A.I.-generated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/technology/ai-csam-cybertipline.html" title="">child sexual abuse material</a> in his home.</p><p>Over the past two years, American legislators have grown increasingly alarmed by the threat of malicious deepfakes. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/30/us/politics/ai-child-sex-abuse.html" title="">Sexual images</a> of middle school students <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/08/technology/deepfake-ai-nudes-westfield-high-school.html" title="">have been digitally faked</a> without their permission. Vice President JD Vance <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1904222280655286776" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">disavowed</a> an <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/viral-posts-share-phony-leaked-audio-of-vance-criticizing-musk/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">almost certainly inauthentic clip</a> that mimicked his voice to criticize Elon Musk. An ad featuring an A.I.-generated version of the actress Jamie Lee Curtis was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-05-13/jamie-lee-curtis-explains-why-she-pushed-back-against-fake-ai-instagram-ad" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">removed</a> from Instagram only after she posted <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJkBA6nRO3I/?img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a public complaint</a>.</p><p>Legislators are responding. Already this year, 26 laws governing various kinds of deepfakes have been enacted, following 80 in 2024 and 15 in 2023, according to the political database <a href="https://legislation.ballotpedia.org/ai-deepfakes/home" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ballotpedia</a>. This month <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/22/bree-smith-inspired-bill-battling-online-deep-fakes-passed-in-legislature/83210340007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in Tennessee</a>, sharing deepfake sexual images without permission became <a href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/Billinfo/default.aspx?BillNumber=SB1346&amp;ga=114" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a felony</a> that carries up to 15 years of prison time and as much as $10,000 in fines. Iowa enacted <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2024/03/06/bills-addressing-ai-created-porn-misleading-content-pass-iowa-house/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two bills</a> related to sexually explicit deepfakes last year, one of which established sexual images of children generated by A.I. as a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,245 fine for the first offense. In New Jersey, a <a href="https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562025/approved/20250402a.shtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently approved</a> ban on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/08/technology/deepfake-ai-nudes-westfield-high-school.html" title="">malicious deepfakes</a> could result in a fine of up to $30,000 and prison time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An unapproved ad featuring an A.I.-generated version of the actress Jamie Lee Curtis was removed from Instagram only after she posted a public complaint.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ryan Pfluger for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We’re in a very dangerous time, and we’re playing defense on everything that we do,” said Josh Lowenthal, a Democrat in the California Assembly, while introducing a session last week in Sacramento on the dangers of deepfakes.</p><p>Mr. Lowenthal, who co-sponsored a <a href="https://legiscan.com/CA/sponsors/AB621/2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently introduced bill</a> targeting sexually explicit deepfake material, later watched <a href="https://civai.org/explore/all" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a demonstration</a> of the technology spit out a realistic image of him in a prison cell and produce a fake news story about comments he never made.</p><p>“I would’ve thought that was me,” he said after hearing deepfake audio of his voice, generated on the spot.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Reining in deepfakes has also become a federal priority, and a markedly bipartisan one. Congress overwhelmingly passed the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/us/politics/house-revenge-porn-bill.html" title="">Take It Down Act</a>, which criminalizes the nonconsensual sharing of sexually explicit photos and videos, including A.I. content, and requires tech platforms to quickly remove the content once they are notified. President Trump signed the bill in the White House Rose Garden on Monday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/us/melania-trump-take-it-down-act.html" title="">accompanied by his wife, Melania</a>, who backed the legislation.</p><p>But lawmakers’ enthusiasm for deepfake legislation has also set off a surge of pushback. Critics complain that many of the laws stifle free speech, constrain American competitiveness and are so complicated to enforce that they are, in effect, toothless.</p><p>Because of those concerns, some Republicans in Congress are trying to curb the state actions. They are now considering a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/13/house-reconciliation-bill-state-ai-preempt/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10-year moratorium</a> that would stop states from enforcing and passing legislation related to artificial intelligence, giving the federal government sole regulatory authority and lessening the pressure on A.I. companies. Soon after re-entering office, Mr. Trump revoked an <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/01/2023-24283/safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> from his predecessor that sought to ensure the technology’s safety and transparency, issuing his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/removing-barriers-to-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">own executive order</a> that decried “barriers to American A.I. innovation” and pushed the United States “to retain global leadership” in the field.</p><p>Regulating artificial intelligence requires balance, said Representative Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat from New Jersey who has helped write multiple deepfake bills. For all its potential dangers, he said, the technology could also become a powerful engine for job creation and creative expression.</p><p>“It’s an ever-evolving space,” said Mr. Gottheimer, a candidate for governor who last month <a href="https://x.com/Josh4Jersey/status/1916821400154734959" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted a video</a> that featured, with a disclosure, a digitally generated version of himself boxing with Mr. Trump. “The key is making sure that people are protected as we harness the opportunities here.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Some state laws have also been challenged in court. In California, a conservative YouTube creator who posted an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/27/us/politics/elon-musk-kamala-harris-deepfake.html" title="">edited campaign video</a> spoofing former Vice President Kamala Harris’s voice sued the attorney general last fall over two laws focused on election-related deepfakes. His argument: The regulations force social media companies to censor protected political speech, including parodies, and allow anybody to sue over content that he or she dislikes.</p><p>The lawsuit now <a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/tracker/kohls-v-bonta/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">includes plaintiffs</a> such as The Babylon Bee, a right-wing satirical site; Rumble, the right-wing streaming platform; and X, the social media company owned by Mr. Musk (which last month also <a href="https://x.com/globalaffairs/status/1915175720906858723?s=46" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sued Minnesota</a> over a similar law). A federal judge ordered that enforcement of one of the California laws be temporarily <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.caed.453046/gov.uscourts.caed.453046.40.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paused</a>, saying it “acts as a hammer instead of a scalpel.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Dubuque County, Iowa, Sheriff Joseph L.

Occasionally, the companies behind the websites or apps that people use to make A.I. images are uncooperative, especially if they are based in a country where an Iowa law has no power, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“That’s where you can hit snags and are short on options for what you can do,” he said. “Sometimes, it just seems like we’re chasing our tails.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump signed the Take It Down Act on Monday, accompanied by the first lady, Melania Trump.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>While most deepfake bans are focused on sexual, political or artistic content, the technology also has banks and other businesses on high alert. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/business/economy/fed-barr-vice-chair.html" title="">Michael S. Barr</a>, a member of the Federal Reserve’s board of governors, said <a href="https://www.bis.org/review/r250428f.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a speech</a> last month that the technology “has the potential to supercharge identity fraud.”</p><p>One deepfake scam bilked Arup, a British design and engineering company that worked on the Sydney Opera House and Beijing’s Bird’s Nest stadium, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/02/deepfake-ai-cybercrime-arup/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">out of $25 million</a> last year. Fraudsters also tried to target Ferrari last summer, using <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-ferrari-hit-the-brakes-on-a-deepfake-ceo/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WhatsApp messages</a> that mimicked the southern Italian accent of the automaker’s chief executive. </p><p>“If this technology becomes cheaper and more broadly available to criminals — and fraud detection technology does not keep pace — we are all vulnerable to a deepfake attack,” Mr. Barr said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tiffany Hsu reports on the information ecosystem, including foreign influence, political speech and disinformation</p></div></div></div></article></div>
