They said Hamas was holding his body, and described him as “a fallen soldier held hostage by a terrorist organization.”</p><p>The military did not explain why it was announcing Mr. Neutra’s death now. In the past it has cited new intelligence or forensic evidence when updating the status of those believed to be held in Gaza.</p><p>Mr. Neutra grew up near New York City and was doing military service when Hamas invaded southern Israel, killing over 1,200 people and capturing 250 hostages.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Neutra’s parents, Orna and Ronen, have been high-profile public campaigners for the release of their son and the roughly 100 other hostages still held in the Gaza Strip, about half of whom are believed to remain alive.</p><p>“We are private and not very political, and yet we find ourselves caught up in the middle of the most controversial geopolitical war in decades,” Orna Neutra, his mother, wrote in an <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/01/world-news/our-son-has-been-held-captive-by-hamas-for-300-days/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opinion essay</a> for The New York Post in August. “Our life as we knew it, is gone.”</p><p>Since their son’s capture, Mr. Neutra’s parents have addressed the Republican National Convention, met at the White House with President Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, and visited the Pentagon and the House of Representatives.</p><p>They have also criticized Mr. Netanyahu, writing in The Post that they “questioned his sincerity and sense of urgency” in pursuing the release of the hostages. On Monday, the prime minister praised their son as “a hero of the Israeli army.”</p><p>“Omer was a man of values, blessed with talents and a Zionist in every aspect of his being,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement. “He immigrated to Israel to enlist in the I.D.F., chose a combat path and was chosen to command and lead,” he said, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Thanksgiving, the Neutra family had renewed calls for their son’s release, and drew attention to those still held in Gaza.</p><p>“For us, it’s no holiday,” Ronen Neutra said in an <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/28/politics/omer-neutra-family-israeli-hostage-ceasefire/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> on CNN last week. “Our holiday table is empty a second year in a row.
