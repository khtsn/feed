    <h1>Omer Neutra, Thought to Be Hostage in Gaza, Died on Oct. 7, IDF Says</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Neutra’s parents, Orna and Ronen, have been high-profile public campaigners for the release of their son and the roughly 100 other hostages still held in the Gaza Strip, about half of whom are believed to remain alive.</p><p>“We are private and not very political, and yet we find ourselves caught up in the middle of the most controversial geopolitical war in decades,” Orna Neutra, his mother, wrote in an <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/01/world-news/our-son-has-been-held-captive-by-hamas-for-300-days/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opinion essay</a> for The New York Post in August. “Our life as we knew it, is gone.”</p><p>Since their son’s capture, Mr. Neutra’s parents have addressed the Republican National Convention, met at the White House with President Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, and visited the Pentagon and the House of Representatives.</p><p>They have also criticized Mr. Netanyahu, writing in The Post that they “questioned his sincerity and sense of urgency” in pursuing the release of the hostages. On Monday, the prime minister praised their son as “a hero of the Israeli army.”</p><p>“Omer was a man of values, blessed with talents and a Zionist in every aspect of his being,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement. “He immigrated to Israel to enlist in the I.D.F., chose a combat path and was chosen to command and lead,” he said, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.</p></div></div>
