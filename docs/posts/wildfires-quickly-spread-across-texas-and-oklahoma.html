Preliminary reports showed that at least four people had died in crashes around Amarillo, according to Sgt. Cindy Barkley with the Texas Department of Public Safety.</p><p>Images on social media showed a dystopian view of the area. Emergency workers were confronting a heavy dust storm as they went car by car looking for anyone trapped inside. A man making one of the videos could be heard saying, “You want to go to Mars?

She was staying in the basement of a Methodist church about 20 miles away. Many people had gotten rooms at her motel to seek refuge from the highway winds.</p><p>“Go east,” Ms. Morland, 57, said she told her guests when she learned they had to leave.</p><p>Ms. Morland said she could smell the fire when she packed into her vehicle with her dog, a Rhodesian Ridgeback named Stella, and a stranger. She said about 50 other evacuees were staying with her in the church basement.</p><p>“I was frightened,” she said.</p><p>Alanreed, another small community in Gray County, about 60 miles east of Amarillo, was also advised to evacuate on Friday because of the threat of fire, said Dustin Miller, an emergency management spokesman for the city of Pampa, the county seat. He said that wind gusts in the area had reached 101 miles per hour, diminishing visibility and making travel treacherous.</p><p>“It’s dying down slowly, but not enough,” Mr. Miller said.</p><p>He said there were no injuries or property damage reported as of Friday afternoon in the county.
