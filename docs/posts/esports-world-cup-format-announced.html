			<p>Honestly it&#39;s not that big of a deal to watch this in some form, as long as you know, and you don&#39;t share it, hype it, watch it live, etc. I don&#39;t really fault the participating teams or talent either, gotta make money somehow. If the Saudis want to give away lots of their oil money to esports orgs, let them.</p>
<p>Just don&#39;t recognize it as real sports/esports. </p>		</div></div>
