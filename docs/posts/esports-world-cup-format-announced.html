		<p>The Esports World Cup has <a href="https://x.com/EWC_EN/status/1901634635723100551?t=Uyc168rYg0-9uqQfl0RfUQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank">announced</a> the dates and format for their Valorant event after Valorant was confirmed last month to be a part of the EWC through 2027.</p>

<p>The six-day tournament will begin on July 8, just before the beginning of Stage 2. 16 participating teams will first compete in a four-group group stage, which will include a reported 12 matches on the first day, four on the second, and four on the third. The top two teams from each group will advance to an eight-team single-elimination playoff bracket to determine the winner. The announcement does not include information about which games will be played as best-of-ones, best-of-threes, or best-of-fives.</p>

<em>The official tournament format for Valorant at EWC.</em></p>

<p>The event will fall on the first week of the wider annual seven-week EWC event, which will be held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Information has not yet been released about how the competing teams will be selected. While the EWC notably <a href="https://esportsworldcup.com/en/news/ewcf-club-partner-program-2025" target="_blank">announced</a> the 40 organizations participating in their Club Partner Program for 2025 earlier today, with the majority of them being involved in VCT, participation in this program focuses on financial sponsorship and does not guarantee a spot in the event.</p>

		<p>EWC is funded by the Saudi regime. The Saudi govt restricts women&#39;s rights, LGBT rights, freedom of speech, etc. They&#39;re trying to buy most of global sports with their oil money, because everybody loves sports, right? Aka, sportswashing.</p>

			<p>Honestly it&#39;s not that big of a deal to watch this in some form, as long as you know, and you don&#39;t share it, hype it, watch it live, etc. I don&#39;t really fault the participating teams or talent either, gotta make money somehow. If the Saudis want to give away lots of their oil money to esports orgs, let them.</p>
