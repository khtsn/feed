Trump called for the creation of a government efficiency commission in an economic speech in New York on Thursday, adopting a policy idea that was pitched to him by the billionaire businessman Elon Musk.</p><p>Mr. Trump said that Mr. Musk would also lead the commission, which would conduct a sweeping audit of the federal government and recommend “drastic reforms” for cutting waste. He said the commission would save “trillions of dollars.”</p><p>In a wide-ranging and sometimes meandering speech that lasted more than an hour, Mr. Trump recast his first-term record as an economic miracle and renewed his pitch for lowering taxes and raising tariffs on imports, often disregarding some of the potential implications of his new proposals.</p><p>The trade wars that Mr. Trump started had painful consequences for American farmers, and the new tariffs that he called for would also likely trigger backlash and retaliation from other countries. Mr. Trump claimed that his new tax cuts would be paid for by spurring economic growth, but the 2017 tax cuts he enacted increased the national debt and his growth projections never panned out.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s embrace of the concept of a government efficiency commission — a favorite Washington solution for delaying dealing with hard problems — comes as he is trying to define how his stewardship of the economy would differ from that of his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. He has assailed her economic vision as one that would saddle the economy with wasteful spending and burdensome regulations.</p><p>During his speech, Mr. Trump also vowed to eliminate 10 existing government regulations for every new regulation added under his potential new administration. Mr. Trump — who during his presidency issued an executive order vowing a similar two-for-one rule — argued that the cost of regulations was being passed onto consumers.</p><p>Trump advisers said it was not yet clear how a government efficiency commission would be staffed. But having Mr. Musk lead such a commission could pose potential conflicts of interest. His rocket company, SpaceX, has contracts from the federal government. And his car company, Tesla, has benefited from tax credits and government incentives meant to spur the production and adoption of electric vehicles.</p><p>Mr. Trump, in his address to the Economic Club of New York on Thursday, also made the case for a repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which was President Biden’s signature climate and tax legislation.</p><p>On tax policy, Mr. Trump said that he would lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 21 percent. However, companies would be eligible for that reduction, he said, only if they make their products in the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Trump previously cut the rate from 35 percent in 2017. Ms. Harris has proposed raising it to 28 percent.</p><p>And on trade, Mr. Trump signaled that another aggressive round of protectionist measures would be in store for companies that do not produce their goods in the U.S. He branded these “smart tariffs” as a way to shield domestic industries from foreign competition, and insisted that they would not fuel inflation.</p><p>Mr. Trump has previously called for imposing a 10 to 20 percent tariff on most imports, as well as a more than 60 percent tariff on Chinese products. He suggested on Thursday that the tariff rates could be higher than what he has proposed.</p><p>“We will be bringing in billions and billions of dollars, which will directly reduce our deficits,” Mr. Trump said.</p><p>Building on his frequent promise to boost domestic energy production, Mr. Trump said he would declare a national emergency to help cut through bureaucratic regulations and boost drilling for oil, new pipelines and new power plants. American oil and gas production has hit record levels under Mr. Biden, but Mr. Trump said that it would be “four times higher” had he been elected in 2020.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Joseph Costello, a Harris campaign spokesman, criticized Mr. Trump’s economic plans, pointing to reports by experts that have suggested his tariffs would raise costs for consumers rather than lower them. “His agenda will shrink the economy, crush job growth, raise taxes on the middle class, drive up inflation, and explode the national debt,” Mr. Costello said in a statement.</p><p>Mr. Trump had previously discussed the idea of an efficiency commission but he stopped short of saying he would adopt it, in a live-streamed conversation with Mr. Musk last month on X, the entrepreneur’s social-media platform.</p><p>Though Mr. Musk was once a strong supporter of Democrats and a vocal Trump skeptic, he has grown closer with Mr. Trump as his own politics have shifted. As the tech billionaire became more conservative, Mr. Trump and his team began courting his support.</p><p>Mr. Musk endorsed Mr. Trump in July, just hours after Mr. Trump survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania. Their closeness led to Mr. Trump’s return to X, which was formerly Twitter and was long Mr. Trump’s favored social-media platform before he was barred in 2021 and launched a competitor.</p><p>Mr. Trump has a tendency to divert any policy-focused speech toward his talking points from his rallies. He veered at times on Thursday to criticize the Biden administration’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, to accuse Ms. Harris of leftist policies on policing and immigration and to stoke fear around migrants and crime.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>His speech included some of his frequent false claims, including his assertion that all the job growth during the Biden presidency had gone to undocumented immigrants.</p><p>Still, the crowd at Thursday’s speech was more disciplined than the audience at a typical Trump rally. Hundreds of men and women in business attire gathered inside Cipriani’s cavernous bank-turned-banquet hall on East 42nd Street, seated at round tables dressed with white linens.</p><p>The audience included many former members of Mr. Trump’s administration, including Steven Mnuchin, his Treasury secretary; Wilbur Ross, his commerce secretary; and Robert Lighthizer, the trade adviser. Financial leaders — Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan; John Paulson, the hedge fund investor; and Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of Blackstone — were also in attendance.</p><p>After his speech, Mr. Trump took four questions from members of the Economic Club. Reshma Saujani, the founder of both Moms First and Girls Who Code, asked Mr. Trump what legislation he might prioritize to address rising child care costs.</p><p>In a jumbled answer, Mr. Trump said he would commit to legislation but did not offer any specifics, insisting that his other economic policies, including tariffs, would “take care” of child care. “As much as child care is talked about as being expensive, it’s, relatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we’ll be taking in,” Mr. Trump said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Harris’s campaign, in a statement, called Mr. Trump’s economic plan an effective “tax hike on middle class families” that would not make child care more affordable.</p><p>Mr. Trump was also asked how he might alter existing economic sanctions, particularly on Russia.</p><p>Acknowledging that he had imposed some during his presidency, Mr. Trump said he would aim to “use sanctions as little as possible” in a bid to avoid other countries turning to Chinese currency. Though he has often cited the sanctions he imposed on Iran as a signature policy achievement, Mr. Trump also suggested that he believed the Biden administration was leaving existing sanctions on other countries in place for too long.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Gold is a political correspondent for The Times covering the campaigns of Donald J.
