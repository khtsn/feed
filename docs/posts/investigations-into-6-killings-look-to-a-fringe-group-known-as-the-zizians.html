The group’s goals aren&#39;t completely clear but <a href="https://zizians.info/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">online writings</a> about their beliefs touch upon veganism, artificial intelligence and gender identity.</p><p>The latest arrests in Maryland have brought renewed attention to the rash of cases across state lines, and prosecutors have said that they have the group’s leader in custody on trespassing and weapon charges. Legal representatives listed in court records for some of the defendants could not be immediately reached or had no comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here’s what we know.</p><h2 id="link-74a4a33d">Three are held on trespassing charges in Maryland.</h2><p>On Feb. 16, law enforcement authorities in Allegany County, Md., arrested Jack LaSota, 34, Michelle Zajko, 32, and Daniel Blank, 26, for an incident in Frostburg, Md., a small city about 130 miles west of Baltimore. LaSota and Zajko were accused of trespassing, obstruction, and possessing a handgun. Blank did not face the weapon charge, but was arraigned on the other charges, while Zajko was also charged with resisting arrest.</p><p>They were located after a resident reported three “suspicious” people on his property who had requested to camp there for a month, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/us/leader-zizian-group-held-without-bail/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to CNN</a>. When police arrived, two of the suspects were sitting in a box truck wearing gun belts with ammunition, <a href="https://6abc.com/post/police-arrest-apparent-leader-cultlike-zizian-group-linked-multiple-killings-us/15925626/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Associated Press and ABC 6 in Philadelphia</a> reported.

James Elliott, the state’s attorney in Allegany County, noted in that hearing that LaSota had faked their own death. During the hearing, LaSota denied having done anything wrong and expressed a “mild state of delirium” because of lack of food.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>LaSota’s beliefs are centered around upending moral norms, practicing extreme veganism and accepting the concept of gendered brain hemispheres, according to Zizians.info, a website that is critical of the group. The group itself does not appear to have an official presence online, outside of old blog posts.</p><p>The three defendants were held without bail and will next appear in court on March 24.</p><h2 id="link-4330721a">A federal agent is shot in Vermont.</h2><p>In January, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/us/border-patrol-agent-shooting-arrest.html" title="">federal authorities arrested</a> Teresa Youngblut in connection with a confrontation that led to the fatal shooting of a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Coventry, Vt.</p><p>The Border Patrol said that Youngblut drew a handgun and fired it at agents without warning during a routine traffic stop on Jan. 20.
