    <h1>Supreme Court to Hear Louisiana Congressional Map Dispute</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Louisiana is one of several Southern states forced by the courts to revise its congressional maps after accusations of racial discrimination. According to the 2020 census, nearly a third of the population in the state is Black.</p><p>In response, the Republican-led Legislature redrew the map, but a federal judge barred the state from using it, finding that the map likely violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 because only one of the six congressional districts had a majority Black population.</p><p>In January, Louisiana lawmakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/19/us/politics/louisiana-voting-map.html" title="">approved a version of the map</a> that added a second district with a majority of Black voters.</p><p>Under the new map, the second district links communities in Baton Rouge, the state’s capital, in the southeastern part of the state, with Shreveport, in the state’s northwest.</p><p>A group of residents who identify as non-African American and who are known in court filings as the “Callais plaintiffs,” challenged the new version of the map, saying it amounted to a racial gerrymander. They added that lawmakers had moved to “segregate voters based entirely on their races,” and had improperly stitched together “communities in far-flung regions of Louisiana.”</p></div></div>
