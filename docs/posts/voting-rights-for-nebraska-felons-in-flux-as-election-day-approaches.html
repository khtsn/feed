felonies to cast a ballot immediately after completing their sentences, it was a moment of bipartisan unity.</p><p>That moment did not last.</p><p>Just before the <a href="https://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/108/PDF/Slip/LB20.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">measure</a> was set to take effect last month, the state’s Republican attorney general, Mike Hilgers, issued a written opinion that the law was unconstitutional. He did not stop there. Mr. Hilgers added that a law on the books since 2005, allowing felons to vote two years after finishing their sentences, was also based on a flawed interpretation of the Nebraska Constitution.</p><p>In the weeks since, people convicted of crimes and election administrators have been caught in legal limbo. Had thousands of former criminals been wrongly allowed to vote for 19 years, as the attorney general argued, or were potential new voters being unfairly blocked from registering this year, as supporters of the new law claimed?</p><p>Hastily scheduled arguments held in front of the Nebraska Supreme Court on Wednesday are the best hope of settling those questions before Election Day, when Nebraska’s vote could carry special import because of the way the state splits its Electoral College votes by congressional district.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“I am hopeful that the Nebraska Supreme Court will quickly issue a decision prior to the November general election,” Secretary of State Bob Evnen, a Republican who last month instructed county election officials to stop registering people convicted of felonies who had not been pardoned, said in a statement. “We will follow whatever direction the court gives us regarding felon registrations.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mike Hilgers, the attorney general of Nebraska, issued a written opinion that the law was unconstitutional.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In a lawmaking season in Lincoln filled with discord over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/12/us/nebraska-drugs-needle-exchange.html" title="">needle exchanges</a>, <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/08/20/legislature-passes-slimmed-down-property-tax-relief-package-ends-nebraskas-special-session/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">property taxes</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/04/us/politics/nebraska-winner-take-all-trump.html" title="">election procedures</a>, the bill to expand voting rights for felons passed with limited opposition in the unicameral Legislature, which is officially nonpartisan but dominated by Republicans. Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican, allowed the bill to become law without his signature.</p><p>The bill’s sponsor, State Senator Justin Wayne, a Democrat from Omaha, told his colleagues during a floor debate that, “at the end of the day, when you have completed your sentence, when you are done, you should be able to participate in our society fully and completely.” </p><p>Other lawmakers said they were more comfortable with the status quo. “I think somebody should wait two years, to make sure that they haven’t gone back into criminal activity,” said State Senator Robert Clements, a Republican.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Nebraska was among at least 26 states in recent decades that made it easier for people convicted of felonies to vote, according to an <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/reports/expanding-the-vote-state-felony-disenfranchisement-reform-1997-2023/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysis by The Sentencing Project</a>, a nonprofit group that seeks to limit imprisonment. The new Nebraska law built on an earlier measure that abolished a lifelong ban on voting for former criminals, but required them to wait two years after completing sentences.</p><p>Mr. Hilgers, who was elected in 2022, said both laws were improper. In an 18-page opinion published last month, Mr. Hilgers wrote that only the Nebraska Board of Pardons, not the Legislature, could restore a felon’s voting rights.</p><p>The State Constitution, he wrote, made clear that “the act of restoring civil rights is a pardon and within the exclusive power of the Board of Pardons.” The Board of Pardons is composed of the attorney general, the secretary of state and the governor. Mr. Hilgers declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Justin Wayne, a lawmaker from Omaha, told his colleagues during a floor debate that, “at the end of the day, when you have completed your sentence, when you are done, you should be able to participate in our society fully and completely.” </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rebecca S.

He later said that people who already had registered to vote under the prior law would not be purged from the voter rolls until the State Supreme Court decided the case. </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Nebraska debate comes as Republican officials in several states seek to tighten voter registration rules or reconsider when people with felony convictions should be eligible to cast ballots.</p><p>This month, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed Arizona to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/us/politics/supreme-court-arizona-voter-registration-law.html" title="">require</a> that people using a state form to register to vote show proof of citizenship. In Virginia last year, Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, said he had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/06/us/virginia-youngkin-voting-former-felons.html" title="">rescinded</a> a policy of automatically restoring voting rights to residents who completed felony sentences. And former President Donald J. Trump’s campaign this month <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/us/politics/trump-walz-felony-voting-rights.html" title="">criticized</a> Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, the Democratic nominee for vice president, for <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/03/politics/tim-walz-minnesota-voting-rights/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">signing</a> a law that allows people with felony convictions to vote after they complete their prison sentences. (Mr. Trump was convicted of felonies in New York this year.)</p><p>Supporters of the Nebraska law, on behalf of three people who said they hoped to vote, sued over the implementation of the attorney general’s opinion. They argued in legal filings that the Legislature was fully within its rights to allow people convicted of felonies to vote, and said that Mr. Hilgers’s opinion had injected uncertainty into the election season. One group, Civic Nebraska, said it had to cancel voter registration events for former criminals after the opinion was published.</p><p>“Once someone has done their time, they deserve a second chance,” Jeremy Jonak, a plaintiff in the case who has a felony conviction, said in a statement provided by the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska. He added: “I hope I can help make a difference — not just for my sake — but everyone else who has earned their second chance and has a right to vote.”</p><p>During oral arguments on Wednesday, a State Supreme Court justice asked Nebraska’s solicitor general whether and how the fact that many people with felony convictions were allowed to vote for 19 years should affect their decision. The solicitor general, Eric Hamilton, said it should have no bearing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“The last 19 years are contrasted against 130 years of unbroken practice in this state of re-enfranchisement through executive clemency,” Mr. Hamilton said.</p><p>The court’s eventual ruling could help shape the electorate in races with national consequences. Though Nebraskans reliably vote Republican in statewide elections, the state splits its Electoral College votes by congressional district, and both parties compete for a single electoral vote from an Omaha-based district that supported President Biden in 2020 and Mr. Trump in 2016.</p><p>That district could also help determine partisan control of the U.S. House of Representatives. The incumbent Republican, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/us/politics/republican-don-bacon-wins-in-biden-district.html" title="">Don Bacon</a>, a relatively moderate retired Air Force general, is facing a challenge from State Senator Tony Vargas, a Democrat who has attracted funding from national groups.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mitch Smith is a Chicago-based national correspondent for The Times, covering the Midwest and Great Plains.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mitch-smith">More about Mitch Smith</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/08/28/us/nebraska-felon-voting.html">53</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/08/28/us/nebraska-felon-voting.html">53</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
