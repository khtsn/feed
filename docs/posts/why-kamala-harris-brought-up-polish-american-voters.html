Yes or no?”</p><p>After Trump basically said no, Harris detailed her 2023 visit to Poland and Romania on NATO’s eastern flank and her role in the “righteous defense” of Ukraine. She explained why our NATO allies are “so thankful that you are no longer president.” If Trump had been in office then, “Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe. Starting with Poland. And why don’t you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor.” She ended by calling Putin “a dictator who would eat you for lunch.”</p><p>That was a smart line of attack for reasons beyond Pennsylvania and the Polish American vote. It appeals to veterans and to swing voters looking for a candidate who will stand up for American interests in the world. Many of these voters understand that persuading other nations to contribute more to our common defense (which Biden and Harris have done) is not our only foreign policy objective.</p><p>More broadly, the exchange over the war in Ukraine made Harris look strong and Trump weak. He came across as not just a patsy for dictators (and an autocrat who uses the Hungarian strongman, Viktor Orban, as a character reference), but clueless in claiming that he could settle a complex conflict overnight. While foreign policy is rarely a critical issue in elections during which no American soldiers are in combat, Harris’s fluency in its nuances signaled to voters that she is presidential.</p><p>It’s hard to predict how all of this will play with a bellwether constituency in a bellwether state. Polish American voters have sided with the losing candidate only three times in more than a century. A gaffe by President Gerald Ford in a debate with his challenger, Jimmy Carter, (“I don’t believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.”) helped sink Ford in the 1976 election. But an overheard ethnic slur against Poles by the vice-presidential candidate Spiro Agnew in 1968 did not cost Richard Nixon the election that year.</p><p>In Pennsylvania, Polish Americans were essential to Joe Biden’s victory over Trump there in 2020, following Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss in the state. They identified with Biden as a Scranton native and fellow Catholic, advantages that Harris does not possess.</p><p>It may be “wishful thinking,” as one Pennsylvania professor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/kamala-harris-polish-americans-pennsylvania.html" title="">told The Times</a> last week, to assume Harris can make inroads with this constituency, which cares a lot about the immigration issue. But at least Harris is trying. Attacking Trump for selling out to Putin on the future of Poland is more than just good politics. It’s a sign that she is ready to be the leader of the free world.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="40" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2MxMWU1MWExLTEyMjktNWNiMi04MDc5LWZhZWNmYjRiY2Q5ZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#parenting-costs-usa" data-source-id="100000009694103"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/pamela-paul"><img alt="Pamela Paul" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-16T16:43:02.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 16, 2024, 12:43 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Last month, the surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/08/28/us-surgeon-general-issues-advisory-mental-health-well-being-parents.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued an advisory</a> on the mental health and well-being of parents. Too many parents, Murthy noted, are stressed out by the demands of parenthood in an environment dominated by gun violence, social media and drug epidemics. Murthy recommended policies to support parental mental health, improve child care access, increase parental leave and improve community support.</p><p>That’s nice.</p><p>As for Kamala Harris, if she becomes president, she <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/issues/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wants to offer</a> $6,000 child tax credits to families with newborns and make high-quality child care more affordable.</p><p>That’s also nice.</p><p>But it’s a drop in the bucket. Across the developed world, parents are stressed over social media and their kids doing well at school. But in many European countries, parents can <em>afford</em> to stress about those things because they have access to free or heavily subsidized child care, health care and education. (These countries also have sensible gun laws, but that’s another story.)</p><p>Here in America, we get none of that. If American parents didn’t have to sweat over saving <a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2017/01/13/cost-raising-child" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> to pay for these larger things, they might have the time and mental space to attend to child-rearing’s ordinary challenges. If they didn’t have to panic over their kids’ futures being subject to these same expenses and a merciless job market, they wouldn’t be quite so frantic about their children’s education and whether it will adequately prepare them for an economically secure future.</p><p>My European friends think what American parents put up with is bonkers, but unlike many Americans, they don’t blame parents. They recognize that American parents are trapped in an impossible system.</p><p>Fifteen years ago, I wrote a book called “<a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780805089240/parentinginc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Parenting, Inc.: How the Billion-Dollar Baby Business Has Changed the Way We Raise Our Children</a>.” That book was largely about how companies exploit parents’ fears to sell them products and services intended to make their children “succeed.” That market has since metastasized, but its underlying cause remains the same. “The cost of raising children is rising far faster than our earnings,” I wrote. “That leaves even couples who make decent salaries belaboring the decision to have children based on the bottom line.” Republicans like JD Vance have <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jd-vance-child-tax-credit-5000-what-to-know/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested a similarly meager tax credit</a> in their push to get Americans reproducing. And even Democrats are too tentative to push for systemic change in health care, child care or education. The picayune proposals currently on the table amount to petty change, not to any material change at all.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="37" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzMyZjZmOGQwLWNhM2YtNTRkNS04NzNkLTEzZDFjZDkwZTc0ZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#american-voters-in-the-shadow-of-another-gunman" data-source-id="100000009693475"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-healy"><img alt="Patrick Healy" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-16T09:04:01.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 16, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p><em>Every Monday morning on The Point, we start the week with a tipsheet on the latest in the presidential campaign. Here’s what we’re looking at this week:</em></p><ul><li><p>After the Kamala Harris-Donald Trump debate last week, I held a focus group with young, undecided voters and we discussed the 2024 election.</p><p>“It feels like something out of a dystopian movie,” a 22-year-old said.</p><p>“Full of twists and turns,” one 24-year-old replied.</p><p>“A confusing whirlwind,” a 21-year-old called it.</p></li><li><p>These three voters grew up in a country and a world shaped and scarred by 9/11, the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina, Twitter, the Great Recession, Sandy Hook, a rapidly warming planet, the famines and food crises across Africa, President Donald Trump, Charlottesville, Covid, George Floyd, Jan. 6, deep fakes, Ukraine, Oct. 7, Gaza. I call these young voters the wrong-track generation: For pretty much their entire lives, a majority of Americans have said that the country was on the wrong track, and were dissatisfied with how things were going. I’m 53 and I can’t imagine growing up and, through no fault of their own, only knowing an America where so many people thought so many things were so bad.</p></li><li><p>Yesterday I was editing the transcript of this undecided voter focus group when I got an email from the Trump campaign at 2:23 p.m. saying, “President Trump is safe following gunshots in his vicinity.” I thought of those young voters who described last week’s debate as another twist and turn, as more dystopian confusion, and wondered, what will they think of America now?</p></li><li><p>Some have historical perspective, of course: we don’t live in a nation where a senator is caned in the chamber, or assassinations feel commonplace, or the KKK is marching en masse, they told me last week. In our focus groups, one thing people argue about the most is whether America’s best days are behind us or ahead of us. I find those arguments fascinating — the participants feel a deep stake in America, no matter what side they take. And yet I can’t imagine what it is to be a young person in America today, processing so much in a real-time information deluge. What I can imagine is why some young voters are still undecided. Many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/22/opinion/young-voters-focus-group.html" title="">loathe Trump and found Jan. 6 traumatic</a>; at the same time, they care a great deal about trust, and don’t confer it easily — and they don’t feel like Kamala Harris has earned their trust with the handful of big policy speeches, interviews and debates she’s done. People ask me, how can these voters be undecided? But I feel only empathy for them. Thinking about what America has given them in the last two decades, I reply, can you really blame them?</p></li><li><p>This week, these voters and the rest of us will learn more about the F.B.I.’s investigation of what may be an attempted assassination and of the suspected gunman. Trump and Harris both have <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/14/kamala-harris-to-make-blue-wall-campaign-stop-in-wisconsin-next-week/75223412007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">events</a> in which Sunday’s news — and the state of America — will get full airings, I’m sure. The lies about Haitian migrants will most likely continue, and the economy will swing back into public focus with a probable Fed interest rate cut. More twists and turns, in other words, as a lot of voters look for some meaning in it all and think about America’s best days.</p></li></ul></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="36" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzY1NTFiOTk4LTYwZTMtNWFmMC1iNjRhLWQwMjBmZDNjODRmZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#week-bad-political-behavior" data-source-id="100000009691364"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michelle-cottle"><img alt="Michelle Cottle" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-13T21:43:14.920Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 13, 2024, 5:43 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p><em>With less than two months to go until Election Day, it is impossible to keep track of all the political madness afoot.

Loomer started things off by snarking on X that if Kamala Harris wins the presidency, “the White House will smell like curry &amp; White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.” Get it? Because Harris is half Indian.</p><p>The smear wasn’t clever or funny and, in fact, was so thuddingly racist it prompted a public scolding from Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (yep, you read that right: Marjorie. Taylor. Greene), who denounced Loomer’s post as “<a href="https://x.com/mtgreenee/status/1834006729966723558?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1834006729966723558%7Ctwgr%5E63d35bad8e5c15b88f98e2572ac4f97c469a826f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailybeast.com%2Fmaga-civil-war-erupts-as-laura-loomer-and-mtg-trade-blows-in-public" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appalling and extremely racist</a>” and later told CNN that Loomer lacked “<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-calls-far-right-activist-laura-loomer-s-rhetoric-huge-problem-that-doesn-t-represent-maga/ar-AA1qtqpy?ocid=BingNewsSerp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the right mentality</a>” to advise a presidential campaign. Loomer responded by slamming Greene as the real racist — and, oh, yes, also “<a href="https://twitter.com/LauraLoomer/status/1834345178460557673" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gutter trash</a>.”</p></li><li><p>But wait! There’s more. One of the Senate’s top Trump toadies, Lindsey Graham, also publicly warned his MAGA king against associating with the “toxic” Loomer, prompting Loomer <a href="https://twitter.com/LauraLoomer/status/1834305481436967305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1834305481436967305%7Ctwgr%5Eaac1537431bd7d53161ca4c898e229e4949f2b32%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rawstory.com%2Flaura-loomer-lindsey-graham%2F" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to go hard</a> at Graham, with an attack on the senator’s loyalty to Trump and on his sexual orientation.</p><p>I guess this is what happens when you build a political movement on the idea that nastiness and pugilism are signs of courage and integrity.</p></li><li><p>It looks as though Mayor Eric Adams of New York may have a Trumpian predilection for surrounding himself with questionable characters. Various aides have been swept into multiple federal investigations of possible corruption at City Hall and the Police Department. The mayor, a Democrat, has had his phone seized and his judgment questioned, since many of those under investigation were his direct appointees, including the police commissioner, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/nyregion/edward-caban-resigns-nypd-commissioner.html" title="">who resigned on Thursday</a>.</p><p>How is Adams responding to the gathering storm? By explaining to New Yorkers what’s going on or by vowing to clean up his administration? Don’t be silly. He is instead cloaking himself in the good book <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/nyregion/eric-adams-black-churches.html" title="">by comparing himself to Job</a>, the biblical innocent whose suffering was imposed by God as part of a divine test.</p><p>“I wish I could tell you that I had one moment in my life that was a Job moment,” he said at an evangelical Black church in Brooklyn on Sunday. “But I did not have one. I had many.”</p><p>Lord, deliver us from this shameless posturing.</p></li><li><p>Just when you thought Trump’s migrants-munching-pets hullabaloo couldn’t get any more delicious, up pops Marianne Williamson, the erstwhile Democratic presidential hopeful, <a href="https://twitter.com/marwilliamson/status/1834230977788313677" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">with this</a> spiritually themed warning on X:</p><p>“Continuing to dump on Trump because of the ‘eating cats’ issue will create blowback on Nov. 5. Haitian voodoo is in fact real, and to dismiss the story out-of-hand rather than listen to the citizens of Springfield, Ohio confirms in the minds of many voters the stereotype of Democrats as smug elite jerks who think they’re too smart to listen to anyone outside their own silo.”</p><p>I’m just going to leave this here for you to unpack on your own.</p></li></ul></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="34" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzBlYmM1ZDM5LTY3YzAtNWE4OS04ZDk0LWE5YTg5ODg5ZWE2Ng=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#kamala-harris-undecided" data-source-id="100000009691055"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/pamela-paul"><img alt="Pamela Paul" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-13T18:30:03.267Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 13, 2024, 2:30 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>For those for whom the presidential election offers an obvious and decisive choice, there is nothing more baffling than undecided voters.</p><p>What could they possibly be waiting for?</p><p>Donald Trump has made it endlessly clear who he is. Those who count themselves as his fans somehow look at this whiny, wounded figure and see a tough guy and strongman who will stand up for people like them or at least someone who will serve their interests. As for JD Vance, the more he seems to explore who he is, the more he seems to alienate everyone else.</p><p>People who say they don’t know enough about Kamala Harris, on the other hand, have a point. Harris’s strategy is to stay vague, and it’s an astute one: It enables her to capture Never Trumpers, independents, moderates and liberals without alienating the progressive wing, third-party flirters and potential abstainers. This may frustrate those keen on more detail, but her campaign knows too well that every detail risks turning off potential voters.</p><p>Like many people in the broad Harris coalition, I am sure I will dislike some of Harris’s policy decisions and actions. That’s beside the point.</p><p>Or, as the conservative journalist David Frum put it on <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/david-frum-villains-and-monsters" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the “Bulwark” podcast</a> last week, “That’s tomorrow’s problem.” Frum has his own reasons to foresee disagreement with a Harris administration. But, he explained, “today’s problem is you have to save the Constitution, save NATO, save trade, save American leadership in the world.”</p><p>It’s a simple point, but it offers a clarifying framework. For those who are still wavering, consider not only the stakes but also the timeline. If you are at all concerned about those larger issues, you can sweat the smaller ones later. Regardless of any disagreements — petty or significant, ideological or practical — you may have with her, Harris is an intelligent, capable and healthy individual who will be subject to ordinary checks and balances.</p><p>You might say that’s a low bar.

No previous attorney general has had to say these things, because no previous attorney general has been faced with a presidential nominee who has openly promised to politicize the Justice Department if elected (and who took clear steps in that direction when he was last in office).</p><p>That’s the fine line Garland has to walk. He conspicuously did not utter Donald Trump’s name on Thursday, no doubt out of respect for the department’s rule against getting involved in electoral politics, but the hard truth remains: Those conspiracy theories, the threats of violence, the undermining of law enforcement — they are inspired and even promoted by one man, a man who is the single biggest threat to independent justice and the rule of law in America.</p><p>And, unfortunately, a man whom Garland tried his best to ignore until it was too late.</p><p>“There is not one rule for friends and another for foes, one rule for the powerful and another for the powerless, one rule for the rich and another for the poor, one rule for Democrats and another for Republicans,” Garland said in his speech.</p><p>The right words, for sure, but not really true. By delaying any investigation or prosecution of Trump until almost two years after he became attorney general, Garland hamstrung Jack Smith, the dogged and beleaguered special counsel, leaving little time for the predictable unpredictabilities of two high-stakes prosecutions. Both were as solid as federal cases get, and now neither has any chance of being completed before the election, leaving voters without clear legal conclusions about Trump’s responsibility for the Jan. 6 riot and the highly classified documents he took from the White House.</p><p>In short, for Donald Trump there was, and always is, a separate rule. Contrary to the bogus complaints of “lawfare,” the Justice Department has treated Trump better, not worse, than everyone else. If Trump wins in November and orders Justice to drop the prosecutions against him, that will be a lasting tarnish of Garland’s legacy.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="31" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzE0MWI5YmU1LTJjN2MtNTE4Ny05OTNiLWZkN2Y2M2I3MmFkNg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#boston-bulger-busing-anniversary" data-source-id="100000009689971"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/farah-stockman"><img alt="Farah Stockman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-13T09:04:16.904Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 13, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David L.

It stopped at South Boston High School, where white parents threw stones and insults at Black children from Roxbury who were arriving for their first day of class. It made its way to Freedom House in Roxbury, where Black parents, educators and activists strategized about how to keep children safe and continue their struggle for more equitable education.</p><p>On the bus, Ira Jackson — chief of staff to Kevin White, who was mayor of Boston in those fateful days in 1974 — took the microphone and told the incredible story about how the mayor learned on the eve of that first day of school that Whitey Bulger, the notorious Irish American mobster, was planning to kill Black children on those buses. The city was already a tinderbox. An evil act like that would have set it ablaze.</p><p>Mayor White begged Washington for federal marshals, but President Gerald Ford refused. The mayor ended that night at the home of Whitey Bulger’s brother, William, a powerful politician at the time, warning him to dissuade his brother. City Hall then did what it could to beef up the police presence on the streets.</p><p>So while the nation watched in horror that day as a bastion of liberalism revealed its inner Selma, Ira Jackson called the mayor and reported the good news: Nobody had died.</p><p>But if you look back, no one benefited more from the chaos and disorder of those years than Whitey Bulger. Police officers lost their credibility, because they were enforcing an unpopular order. South Boston “became a no man’s land,” Jackson said. Amid the chaos and violence, white students dropped out of South Boston High in droves and never went back. Bulger recruited them to sell drugs.</p><p>That’s the irony: Bulger, who portrayed himself as protecting his white Irish community from dangerous Black people, proved to be his own people’s deadliest scourge, as Michael Patrick MacDonald points out in his memoir, “All Souls: A Family Story From Southie.”</p><p>Standing in the auditorium of South Boston High, MacDonald read from his book for the people on the bus tour and noted how much the people of South Boston and Roxbury had in common then, and now. They were poor and getting a substandard education. And today, they are priced out of the neighborhoods where they were born.</p><p>“What kills me is how easy it is to bring them together,” he told me, of his community organizing work. “When I am working with Black moms and white moms who have lost kids to incarceration or drugs, they see themselves in each other.”</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="30" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzExZjgxZjkyLTFiNzctNTBiMC1iZTAzLTY0ZDgxODgwYTIwNw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#harris-charlotte-supporters-questions" data-source-id="100000009689836"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mara-gay"><img alt="Mara Gay" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/opinion/mara-gay-circular/mara-gay-circular-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/opinion/mara-gay-circular/mara-gay-circular-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/opinion/mara-gay-circular/mara-gay-circular-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-12T22:34:58.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 12, 2024, 6:34 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mara-gay" itemprop="name">Mara Gay</a></p><p>Editorial Board Member, reporting from Charlotte, N.C.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Damon Winter/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Kamala Harris’s buoyant rally in Charlotte, N.C., on Thursday — her first rally since her successful trouncing of Donald Trump at their debate on Tuesday — was full of some of her most faithful supporters. But even here, several voters said they wanted to hear more details about what she intends to do in office.</p><p>“I’d like to see her talk a little more about immigration,” Terra Barnhill, 51, told me after the rally in this battleground state. “A lot of my friends who are on the fence are concerned about that,” Barnhill said.</p><p>Even fully decided voters still had questions about how Harris planned to make their lives better. Muriel Harley, 66, an accountant from Raleigh, said the rally had been thrilling.</p><p>“To me it was emotional, just as a Black woman,” Harley, 66, told me outside the Bojangles Coliseum afterward. Even so, Harley, who wore a shirt with an image of Harris as a child, said she had at least one issue in mind she hoped the candidate would directly address.</p><p>“She needs to talk about student loan forgiveness,” Harley said. “I went back to grad school,” she explained, shaking her head about the loan debt she faced.</p><p>Polls have consistently shown Trump with an edge among voters concerned about the economy, and that concern was reflected even among Democrats who told me they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/opinion/harris-economy-message.html" title="">want to hear more</a> from Harris about what can be done to help Americans grappling with the higher prices they’ve experienced under President Biden, especially at the grocery store.</p><p>At the rally, attended by more than 8,000 very excited supporters, Harris seemed to lean harder into those concerns. She reminded voters of her middle-class upbringing and said she wanted a country where “every American has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business.”</p><p>Harris also repeated her promise of a tax cut for small businesses. “I know they are the backbone of America’s economy,” she said.</p><p>But while Harris has said she would expand the child tax credit and give a tax break to small businesses, she has yet to offer many specifics on what she would do as president to lower prices. She did, however, bring up her plan to offer $25,000 in aid to first-time home buyers — a good idea that would provide direct relief to Americans (though it would certainly require building more housing, something Harris has said she would support).</p><p>Addressing the higher costs Americans are grappling with is thorny: The causes of these economic pressures are complex, and the president’s role in driving down costs is somewhat constrained. Harris will have to find a way to give Americans more specifics anyway. Doing so could be crucial to making sure voters don’t look for relief anywhere else.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="28" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzc2YjI2NjZlLTc3YWQtNTg1MS04MzcwLWZlZGY5NzJlMzIzZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#hurricane-francine-global-warming" data-source-id="100000009689152"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-wallace-wells"><img alt="David Wallace-Wells" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/16/reader-center/author-david-wallace-wells/author-david-wallace-wells-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/16/reader-center/author-david-wallace-wells/author-david-wallace-wells-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/16/reader-center/author-david-wallace-wells/author-david-wallace-wells-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-12T20:21:05.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 12, 2024, 4:21 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gerald Herbert/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>A week ago, the much-hyped hurricane season was looking like a fascinating dud. Forecasters had projected an incredibly busy summer and fall, with many predicting the worst season in modern history. But after an early encounter with Hurricane Beryl, which made an unusual June landfall in Grenada as a Category 4 storm, there has been hardly any activity at all in the Atlantic basin, leading meteorologists and climate scientists alike to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/weather/hurricane-season-atlantic-storms-climate/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wonder</a> what happened and why the terrifying-seeming season fizzled out so spectacularly.</p><p>The waters of the Atlantic remained astonishingly high, meaning that any storm to pass through the waters of the Caribbean or the Gulf of Mexico was likely to become a powerhouse. Nonetheless, weather patterns farther offshore seem to have shifted the geography of storm formation. Tropical cyclones were not appearing off the coast of Africa, where they typically begin their trip westward, but over the continent instead, producing pretty much unheard-of meteorological activity and delivering historic amounts of rainfall to the Sahara.</p><p>Hurricane Francine, which made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 2 on Wednesday, isn’t exactly a historic storm, though it has produced widespread flooding and power outages for hundreds of thousands all along the Gulf Coast. But as a sort of “tweener” weather event, it does illustrate several features of the new phase of climate history we are all now living through, having left behind the window of global temperatures that enclose all of human history — and all of our previous experiences of hurricanes.</p><p>First, even quiet seasons and unexceptional storms can generate an awful lot of damage and disruption. Some of that reflects the increasing level of valuable stuff we keep building blithely in harm’s way. But it also means that even relatively small increases in the actual intensity of extreme events can produce enormous increases in weather damage. Increasingly in the United States, “normal” seeming meteorological events are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-06-13/florida-rain-and-flooding-is-brought-to-you-by-climate-change" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imposing</a> costs in the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars.</p><p>Second, though many people assume that warming will increase the number of hurricanes, in fact, climate science is much more confident that it will make a larger share of them high intensity storms (perhaps even necessitating the creation of new levels on the category scale).</p><p>And third, the behavior of individual storms is itself being changed by warming, which seems particularly effective at getting them to intensify much more rapidly (as Hurricane Otis <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/opinion/acapulco-saw-the-future-of-hurricanes-more-sudden-and-furious.html" title="">did last year in Acapulco</a>, Mexico, growing from a tropical storm to a Category 5 in barely one day). Warming can also make them slow down or even stall right at landfall, often producing more damage in a single place.</p><p>At the moment, Francine feels like a book end to a surprisingly quiet season, but there may well be more to come, given that roughly half of the season lies still ahead of us. In the further future, the pattern is even more forbidding, with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01511-4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one recent paper</a> suggesting that without rapid emissions reductions, nearly three-quarters of the planet could experience unprecedented weather events over just the next 20 years.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="27" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzk1ZTJjZDUyLTIyNzgtNTFmNy1iOGYyLTNmOWU2ODdmYjlkZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#trump-vance-loomer-weird" data-source-id="100000009688774"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-healy"><img alt="Patrick Healy" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-12T17:20:06.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 12, 2024, 1:20 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Right-wing absurdities — Donald Trump’s comments about Haitian migrants eating pets, JD Vance’s comments about “childless cat ladies” (among other things), Project 2025’s ideas, the conspiracist Laura Loomer being in Trump’s inner circle — are breaking through to regular Americans and undecided voters to a degree that undermines the Trump campaign’s goal of positioning the former president as the more moderate, change-oriented candidate in the race. To me, this is the biggest political dynamic coming out of Tuesday’s debate.</p><p>On Wednesday night, I spent a couple of hours with our Times Opinion panel of 14 undecided young voters — a group we are talking to weekly this fall — and I asked them to tell me something they had changed their minds about since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/22/opinion/young-voters-focus-group.html" title="">our first conversation in mid-August</a>. Two of them quickly brought up how much they had soured on Vance. Another young person had heard about Fred Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/politics/donald-trump-nephew-book-fred-trump.html" title="">assertions about Donald Trump and disabled people</a> and felt disgusted with the former president. While many of them still have reservations about Harris after Tuesday’s debate, they were more dismayed with Trump’s behavior and remarks. Some were disgusted by his false allegations about migrants eating pets in Ohio. Two others brought up the images of Loomer and Trump.</p><p>Mark, a 24-year-old chef from California who remains undecided in the race, reflected the sentiments of several in the group when he said of Trump:</p><blockquote><p>He doesn’t necessarily scare me. I think he’s incompetent. What scares me is the people he’s surrounded himself with and how they can use him. Laura Loomer was on the plane with them. The Heritage Foundation and all the plans they have. It just seems like he’s a vessel for other people who are way more competent and have way more plans to do stuff that I personally don’t agree with. I feel like they’re going to use him and get policies enacted that I personally don’t agree with.</p></blockquote><p>A lot of regular people are starting to tune into the presidential race. After the debate, when they looked on TikTok, they saw wacky, unsubstantiated comments about people eating cats on one side and an endorsement from Taylor Swift on the other. Trump and his campaign have tried to position him as the more moderate candidate who would change the economy for the better. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/us/politics/trump-and-harris-times-siena-poll.html" title="">Some polls indicate</a> people see him that way. But the more the wacky stuff breaks through to regular people — and it is breaking through — the worse it will be for Trump.</p><p>He won in 2016 by being someone people felt they could take a chance on. Listening to our undecided young voters, I didn’t expect to hear such disgust over Vance, Loomer and Project 2025. That stuff is catching on. It’s not hard to imagine many Americans deciding in late October to take a chance on Harris (like they did in 2016 with Trump) rather than see a candidate they don’t like take the White House.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="25" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzBhYjhjOTdlLTM0ZGYtNWY3ZC1iMWQwLTg0ODg2Zjc2OWRlYg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#what-harris-shouldnt-say-about-the-economy" data-source-id="100000009688118"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/paul-krugman"><img alt="Paul Krugman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-12T14:15:47.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 12, 2024, 10:15 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>When Kamala Harris talks about economic policy, she talks a lot about the present and the future — about how we currently have low inflation and unemployment, and about things she will do to raise incomes and hold down prices. I’ve seen a number of commentators, however, saying that this isn’t enough, that she also needs to look back, to do more to defend the economic record of the administration in which she has been serving.</p><p>That’s a terrible idea. And I say that as someone who believes that the Biden administration did an excellent job coping with the aftermath of the pandemic. The trouble is that making the case for that record takes a fair bit of explaining. And as the old political saying goes, if you’re explaining, you’re losing.</p><p>Of course, this dictum applies to politicians, not policy wonks. So let me use two charts to do the explaining Harris shouldn’t, then talk about why none of this should be in her speeches.</p><p>First, here’s the evolution of prices and wages since just before the pandemic:</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Why start there, rather than from the month Biden took office? Because economic numbers during the pandemic slump were deeply weird. Oil prices crashed, even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/opinion/trump-gas-prices.html" title="">going negative</a> at one point; average wage data were distorted by the fact that many low-wage workers were laid off; and so on. So better to start in February 2020.</p><p>What you can see right away is that inflation surged in 2021-22 but that the surge was temporary: Over the past year consumer prices have risen only 2.5 percent, and even that number largely reflects a price nobody pays — “owners’ equivalent rent,” an estimate of what homeowners <em>would</em> be paying if they were renters. A <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/research-series/r-hicp-home.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">measure</a> that corresponds to the practice in many other countries, which don’t include that rent equivalent in their inflation numbers, is up only 1.3 percent over the past year.</p><p>Why did we have that temporary inflation surge? The best explanation is that it reflected pandemic-related disruptions. One strong piece of evidence for this proposition is that cumulative inflation since the beginning of the pandemic, using comparable measures, has been similar in many wealthy countries:</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Source: Eurostat</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Still, prices are considerably higher than they were four and a half years ago. But going back to that first chart, so are wages, which for most workers have risen substantially more than prices.</p><p>This is, objectively, a pretty good story. We had a one-time jump in prices, which was probably unavoidable given the effects of the pandemic, or at any rate could have been avoided only at the cost of a severe recession; but inflation is back under control, and workers’ purchasing power is higher than ever.</p><p>But Americans in general are unhappy with the fact that things cost more than they used to and aren’t mollified by the fact that wages have gone up even more.</p><p>This shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a <a href="https://socialeconomicslab.org/research/publications/why-do-we-dislike-inflation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">longstanding result</a> that everyday people don’t think about inflation the way economists do. At times when both prices and wages are rising, people tend to believe that higher prices are taking away their hard-earned wage gains, rather than seeing rising wages and rising prices as two sides of the same coin.</p><p>So should Harris be giving lectures on Econ 101, telling voters, “Look, you just don’t understand”? Any adviser suggesting such a thing should be fired on the spot.</p><p>No, leave it to people like me to argue that Biden was right to allow a temporary spike in inflation — no matter how big the avalanche of hate mail it inevitably produces. I don’t pretend to be an expert on political strategy, but everything I see says that on economics, Harris is right to focus on what can be, unburdened by what has been.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="24" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzliMTJkM2I0LTc3YzctNWUwMi05Njk3LWMwOTQ5YTE5YjM5OA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#one-of-trumps-insidious-lies-on-abortion-is-grounded-in-an-old-truth" data-source-id="100000009687046"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jesse-wegman"><img alt="Jesse Wegman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-11T20:31:10.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 11, 2024, 4:31 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saul Loeb/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>As the debate over the Debate rages a day later, it’s tempting to try to catalog all of the lies Donald Trump told to an audience of tens of millions of Americans. But more interesting than the fact of his lies is <em>how</em> he lies.</p><p>Take a look at the former president’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-trump-presidential-debate-transcript/story?id=113560542" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rambling answer</a> on abortion and reproductive rights. Linsey Davis of ABC News corrected Trump when he claimed, falsely, that Democratic-led states allow “execution after birth.” But he followed that one up with another lie, more insidious and, in its way, more Trumpian.</p><p>“Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, they all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote,” he said.</p><p>Let’s stop right there. The first part — “every legal scholar,” whether liberal or conservative — is not only untrue but obviously so. Just <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/dobbs-v-jackson-womens-health-organization/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">look at the briefs</a> filed at the Supreme Court in the Dobbs case, which overturned Roe v. Wade. You will find an overwhelming number of liberal scholars weighing in on the side of preserving the constitutional right to an abortion.</p><p>But as with so many of Trump’s lies, it is wrapped around a grain of truth. In this case, the grain is that <em>some</em> high-profile liberals once criticized Roe v. Wade. Famously, Ruth Bader Ginsburg <a href="https://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/ECM_PRO_059254.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">did so</a> before she became a Supreme Court justice, arguing that Roe was decided too quickly and too broadly.</p><p>Of course, anyone who listened to her reasoning would learn that she did not want Roe overturned. Rather she wanted it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/05/06/ruth-bader-ginsburg-roe-wade/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to be grounded </a><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/05/06/ruth-bader-ginsburg-roe-wade/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>more</em></a><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/05/06/ruth-bader-ginsburg-roe-wade/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> explicitly in the Constitution</a>, on equal protection grounds, rather than on the right to privacy. In the 1970s, the liberal law professor John Hart Ely <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/06/john-hart-ely-dobbs-roe-legacy.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">strongly denounced Roe</a>, but by 2022, when Justice Samuel Alito quoted Ely in his decision overturning Roe, attitudes like that were near impossible to find on the left.</p><p>This was all part of the political and legal evolution of the debate over abortion rights, but Trump doesn’t do nuance. So he ignored the inconvenient parts of the story and never explained the nature of the objections to Roe. And he changed “some” scholars to “all,” as though through sheer maximalism — the biggest building, the smartest guy, the perfect phone call — he could lull voters into his simplistic, zero-sum view of the world.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that, contrary to Trump’s claim, I have yet to meet anyone who actually <em>wants</em> abortion to be decided on a state-by-state basis. Why would they? No matter where you stand on the issue, it involves profound matters of life and death, bodily autonomy and human equality. What abortion opponent is fine with a rule that lets unborn babies be killed in California but not in Kentucky? What abortion rights supporter is content with protecting women from forced birth in New York but not in Texas?</p><p>This is why we have a federal Constitution that is supreme over the states — it’s how we protect and defend the fundamental rights of all Americans, regardless of where they happen to live. One of those rights — which Americans continue to support <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by at least a 2-to-1 majority</a>, even after Roe was struck down — is a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="22" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzEyNzk3YjRjLWE2ZTQtNWM1NS05NDIwLWMyZmM0MzlmMzhlYw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#inflation-numbers-annual" data-source-id="100000009685970"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/peter-coy"><img alt="Peter Coy" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/27/opinion/author-peter-coy-2/Peter_Coy_Final-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/27/opinion/author-peter-coy-2/Peter_Coy_Final-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/27/opinion/author-peter-coy-2/Peter_Coy_Final-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-11T18:27:22.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 11, 2024, 2:27 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Imagine you’re listening to a football game on the radio and the play-by-play guy says: “Patrick Mahomes takes the snap, throws … and that’s 71 yards gained over the last 12 plays!”</p><p>Ridiculous, right? But that’s exactly what journalists and economists do every month when the inflation numbers come out. Instead of saying what happened in the latest month — the latest “play” — we usually focus on what happened to prices over the past 12 months.</p><p>Can’t blame the government for this. The headline on the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news release</a> from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that came out on Wednesday was this: “<a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" title="CPI for all items rises 0.2% in August; shelter up" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">C.P.I. for All Items Rises 0.2% in August; Shelter Up</a>.” That’s the one-month change in the Consumer Price Index. It’s the equivalent of telling people what happened on the latest play from the line of scrimmage.</p><p>But reports about that announcement said things like this: “Inflation fell in August to 2.5 percent, down from 2.9 percent in July.” Summing up the price change over the past 12 months through August is the equivalent of summing up the total yardage over the past 12 plays.</p><p>The justification for focusing on the price change over the past year is that the monthly numbers are volatile. Looking over an entire year smooths out those ups and downs.</p><p>The problem is that the fresh news gets swamped by stuff that happened in the past. If the Kansas City Chiefs happened to gain 98 yards on a kickoff runback a few plays ago, that will “inflate” the total yardage gained over the past 12 plays. Economists call that a base effect. As time goes on, the 98-yard gain will fall out of the 12-play total and suddenly yardage gained — like measured inflation — will abruptly fall.</p><p>I’m not against measuring the year-over-year change in prices, but I’d like to see more attention on the latest monthly change, which is really the only new thing. What <em>did</em> happen on that Mahomes pass play?</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="21" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2RhM2NlN2YzLTI3N2MtNTM4My1iODRkLTRiODM4NTI1MGMyNg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#krugman-trump-ukraine-europe" data-source-id="100000009685780"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/paul-krugman"><img alt="Paul Krugman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-11T13:01:04.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 11, 2024, 9:01 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>It wasn’t the biggest whopper of the night, but during the debate, Donald Trump — who refused to say that Ukraine should win its war — said some false things about the role our allies are playing. Again, let me give you the full statement, with no <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/trump_incoherent_media_sanewashing.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sanewashing</a>:</p><p>“I want the war to stop. I want to save lives that are being uselessly — people being killed by the millions. It’s the millions. It’s so much worse than the numbers that you’re getting, which are fake numbers. Look, we’re in for $250 billion or more because they don’t ask Europe, which is a much bigger beneficiary to getting this thing done than we are. They’re in for $150 billion less because Biden and you don’t have the courage to ask Europe like I did with NATO. They paid billions and billions, hundreds of billions of dollars when I said either you pay up or we’re not going to protect you anymore. So that may be one of the reasons they don’t like me as much as they like weak people. But you take a look at what’s happening. We’re in for $250 to $275 billion. They’re into $100 to $150. They should be forced to equalize.”</p><p>I’m not sure why he thinks it necessary to claim that the casualty numbers are fake.

In more than 90 minutes of contentious debate, Harris continued to prosecute the case against a second Donald Trump presidency more effectively than perhaps any of his other rivals has since 2015. But was it enough to satisfy those voters who say they still need to know more about her in order to cast a ballot in her favor this November?</p><p>Over the weekend, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/08/us/politics/times-siena-poll-likely-electorate-crosstabs.html" title="">survey by The New York Times and Siena College</a> found that 60 percent of likely voters said they believed America was headed in the wrong direction, and many reported that they didn’t know enough about where Harris stands on several key issues. Any poll is just a snapshot in time, and it is admittedly hard to interpret exactly what those respondents are looking for from her. Do they want a better understanding of how she plans to govern from the Oval Office in terms of policy? Or are they more interested in her character and what type of leader she would be?</p><p>For those voters looking for answers on policy, the debate is unlikely to have left them feeling better informed. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/10/us/elections/trump-harris-attacks-debate-tracker.html" title="">According to the Times tracker,</a> the vice president spent nearly half of her speaking time attacking Trump. She rightfully called out his lies and his dangerous embrace of dictators. She was also strong in defending reproductive rights, as well as President Biden’s record on foreign and domestic policy. And she mentioned a handful of plans she’d pursue if she won the White House.</p><p>Yet we learned very few new details about those plans. On the economy, which voters often rank as the issue of most importance to them, she only scratched the surface in discussing how she’d enact tax cuts, build more affordable housing and help parents of young children. On foreign policy, she committed herself to a two-state solution in the Middle East and to supporting Ukraine in victory over Russia, but she didn’t expand on how she’d seek to achieve either goal. She pledged not to ban fracking but said little on how she would plan to invest in climate solutions. She also continued to dodge questions about why she recently distanced herself from positions that she took in her quest to be the Democratic nominee in 2020.</p><p>Most important, she did very little to distinguish her plans from Biden’s in an election in which the electorate seems hungry for change.</p><p>To be clear, Trump utterly failed to present or defend his policy goals. In many ways, the former president confirmed what has been obvious for years: His main aim, should he win another term, would be to do whatever is best for Donald Trump. He is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/11/opinion/editorials/donald-trump-2024-unfit.html" title="">not fit to serve</a>.</p><p>But on a night when Harris set traps every which way for Trump (and he took the bait essentially every time), the one moment those tables were turned was when the former president asked her what she would do differently from the past three and a half years. Some voters may still be left looking for that answer.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="18" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzJmNzc2ZDRhLWE1NjAtNThjMC04ODViLWE2YTQzNmE1ZDkzMA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#harris-trump-debate-gender" data-source-id="100000009685010"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jessica-bennett"><img alt="Jessica Bennett" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/04/opinion/jessica-bennett-opinion/jessica-bennett-opinion-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/04/opinion/jessica-bennett-opinion/jessica-bennett-opinion-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/04/opinion/jessica-bennett-opinion/jessica-bennett-opinion-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-11T03:50:50.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 10, 2024, 11:50 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>She didn’t shout.

He wouldn’t look at her. He refused to speak her name. He kept referring to “her boss”(President Biden), diminishing her power. But by the end of the debate, I was tallying the ways that Harris had done the reverse: picking at his brittle ego, cracking the fragile facade of his blustering machismo.</p><p>She dismissed the size of his rallies. She mocked his “love letters to Kim Jong-un.” She called him “weak,” referred to him as “this fella” and said Vladimir Putin would “eat you for lunch.” She talked about his multiple bankruptcies (code for him failing as a man and a provider) and noted that he had been “fired by 81 million people” and was clearly “having a hard time processing that,” like a gentle mother, patting her tantruming child on the head.</p><p>And she managed to do it without being shrill or angry or coming off as petty. Worst of all, she laughed at him. It wasn’t a forced or controlled or premeditated laugh. It was a real laugh. A big laugh. The sort of laugh she couldn’t hold in and made those of us watching laugh along with her.</p><p>“Talk about extreme,” she said, as he stared dead-eyed into the distance. She immediately hammered home all of the former generals and advisers who had declared him unfit for office. He could only fidget uncomfortably in response.</p><p>Eight years ago, the same man, perhaps less sleepy but no less angry, hulked over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/us/politics/debate-trump-clinton-harris.html" title="">Hillary Clinton</a> as she tried to ignore him and keep speaking. Now the woman running for this country’s highest office was no longer turning the other cheek. Instead, she laid bare the smallness of Trump’s manhood and asserted her own power, competence and confidence in the face of it. In the end, only a woman could do that for us.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="16" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2M3NGUzMmZmLTBkMDMtNThhMC05NTgyLWMyOGFhY2Y0YzkwNw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#trump-debate-lies" data-source-id="100000009685064"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-firestone"><img alt="David Firestone" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-11T02:58:50.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 10, 2024, 10:58 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adam Gray/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>For the first 10 minutes or so of Tuesday night’s debate, it looked as though the restrained version of Donald Trump might have shown up in Philadelphia, the one who learned his lesson from his failure to curb his impulses in the 2020 debates with Joe Biden. He stayed silent while Kamala Harris ripped up his economic plan, which she correctly noted was based on a tax cut for the wealthy and a sales tax on all imported goods. When it was his turn to respond, he accurately pointed out that the Biden administration had made no attempt to end the tariffs he imposed on China.</p><p>But it didn’t last, and no one who has watched Trump over the past decade thought it could. Within minutes, he descended from a discussion of tariffs into a description of immigrants — one he returned to over and over again during the evening — that could only be described as a form of nativist hysteria.</p><p>“They are taking over the towns,” he said. “They’re taking over buildings. They’re going in violently. These are the people that she and Biden let into our country. And they’re destroying our country. They are dangerous. They’re at the highest level of criminality, and we have to get them out. We have to get them out fast.”</p><p>This was the level of delusion that Harris and her campaign had clearly hoped Trump would demonstrate to voters, and it just got worse from there. “They’re eating the dogs,” he said, referring to Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio — a particularly heinous calumny that began on social media and was spread by his running mate, JD Vance. “The people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating — they’re eating the pets of the people that live there.” When the moderator David Muir pointed out that local officials had seen nothing of the kind, Trump said he heard about it on television.</p><p>Throughout the evening, in moments just like that, Harris was able to do something that Biden had failed to do when he was campaigning for re-election: push Trump in ways that exposed his spattering of lies and wild fantasies.</p><p>This was even true about the frightening attempt on Trump’s life. There has been no evidence that it was politically motivated, but that didn’t stop Trump from claiming it was. “I probably took a bullet to the head because of the things that they say about me,” he said, referring to his false claim that the indictments against him were evidence of “weaponizing” the justice system.</p><p>And asked about his role in undermining the democratic process, he said it was actually Harris who had done so, by usurping Biden’s role atop the ticket. “You talk about a threat to democracy — he got 14 million votes, and they threw him out of office. And you know what? I’ll give you a little secret. He hates her. He can’t stand her. But he got 14 million votes. They threw him out. She got zero votes.”</p><p>The debate was an unqualified success for Harris not just because she was able to define herself and her plans but also because she was able to push a few buttons and let Trump show off his truest self.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="15" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzRiY2UxZDUwLWZmNWEtNWZjNS1iYjYzLTRiZmQ2MDk3MGM2ZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#harris-trump-debate-abortion" data-source-id="100000009685011"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mara-gay"><img alt="Mara Gay" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/opinion/mara-gay-circular/mara-gay-circular-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/opinion/mara-gay-circular/mara-gay-circular-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/opinion/mara-gay-circular/mara-gay-circular-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-11T02:19:51.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 10, 2024, 10:19 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Photo Illustration by Tam Stockton for The New York Times; Source Photograph by Damon Winter/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>When running for office after taking away the reproductive freedoms of roughly half the American public, the best thing to do may simply be to lie about what you have done.</p><p>That was the political calculus made by Donald Trump during Tuesday night’s debate. His bald and outrageous lies about abortion and his role in overturning Roe v. Wade were fantastical, even for him. There’s lying, and then there’s the world of fairy tales, and he chose the latter.</p><p>Trump said Roe v. Wade had “torn our country apart” and that “every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative” wanted the issue to be sent back to the states.</p><p>This is a lie. A majority of Americans supported the protections for abortion under Roe and still do.</p><p>He accused Democrats of supporting killing babies. “In other words, we’ll execute the baby,” he said. This is another lie, and one of the ABC News moderators, Linsey Davis, called him on it. He accused Harris’s running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, of saying “execution after birth” is “absolutely fine.” This, too, is a lie.</p><p>Trump misled those who were watching the debate, saying he believes in “exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.” Yet it is thanks to Trump that states have been able to enact abortion bans that include no such exceptions.</p><p>Vice President Kamala Harris, rightly, pointed out that a majority of Americans believe in a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body and pointed out the pain that has been caused so many women in Republican-led states since the Supreme Court’s decision.</p><p>Abortion bans are a losing issue for Republicans, and Trump did nothing to change that.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2FkZmM4MDU4LWEwZTUtNWE2ZC1hZDFjLTMxOTNkM2JlYmYzYg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#harris-trump-debate-" data-source-id="100000009685014"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-healy"><img alt="Patrick Healy" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-11T01:52:54.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 10, 2024, 9:52 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Damon Winter/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Within the first half-hour of the debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, I heard from four veteran Democratic presidential campaign officials, and all of them had the same reaction to Harris: a strong and confident performance that often put Trump on the defensive, with the potential to win the face-off as he sputtered over abortion rights and students loans.</p><p>Harris went on offense from the start, as she strode across the stage to Trump’s podium and reached out, shook his hand and introduced herself. Her performance was — in pretty much every way — a total contrast to President Biden’s in the June debate, and if Trump had a playbook to win the debate, it wasn’t clear as he scrambled to fight back against her attacks over the economy, tariffs, in vitro fertilization and China.</p><p>Trump’s go-to line — “another lie” — probably pleased many in his MAGA base, but I’m skeptical it was persuasive for many undecided and swing voters. That’s because a lot of those voters have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/series/focus-groups" title="">told The Times</a> that they are tired of Trump’s complaining when they want to hear specifics about what he would do in office.</p><p>Time and again, Harris laid the bait, and Trump took it. “People start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom,” Harris said at one point. When the ABC moderators tried to ask Trump about immigration, he said, “First let me respond to the rallies.” But Harris also found ways to send Trump off on tangents, like when he pushed the lie that migrants in Ohio are killing pets for food. The moderators fact-checked him, but he wouldn’t let it go. And then Harris lowered the boom.</p><p>“Talk about extreme,” she said, laughing.</p><p>The Democratic strategists were struck by how much Harris owned Trump, who raised his voice more and more as the debate unfolded. They saw her as strong but likable and substantive on the issues. As for Republicans, one Trump ally argued that the former president spoke with confidence and strength and that many voters would still be unforgiving of Harris over the Biden-era economy.</p><p>The first 20 to 25 minutes of a debate are often the most important part: America is a country with a short attention span where first impressions count, where politicians try to set the tone and tempo of a debate from the start, and you can often tell quickly if someone will have an off night. Trump is often at his most disciplined (relatively speaking) at the start of a debate; as time goes on, he tends to meander in his answers and get snappish.</p><p>In this case, though, whatever discipline Trump had fell away pretty quickly in the face of a Harris onslaught. If she came under pressure, it was from the ABC moderators who pressed her on her changes in policy positions like on fracking. But I’m skeptical that the pressure from a moderator’s question will break through to voters like the pressure that Harris subjected Trump to on abortion and his proposed tax cuts for the wealthy.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzIzMGE4YTQyLTI0ZGYtNTJkMC04NjQyLWFiZjQ0YjczZDhkOA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#trump-shutdown-voting-citizenship" data-source-id="100000009684725"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michelle-cottle"><img alt="Michelle Cottle" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-10T21:51:05.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 10, 2024, 5:51 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Donald Trump took time out from his pre-debate “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/07/us/politics/trump-harris-debate-prep.html" title="">policy time</a>” on Tuesday to stick his out-of-joint nose into Congress’s fight over funding the government:</p><p>“If Republicans in the House, and Senate, don’t get absolute assurances on Election Security, THEY SHOULD, IN NO WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM, GO FORWARD WITH A CONTINUING RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET,” he <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113114568252208569" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raved on Truth Social</a>. “THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO ‘STUFF’ VOTER REGISTRATIONS WITH ILLEGAL ALIENS. DON’T LET IT HAPPEN — CLOSE IT DOWN!!!”</p><p>Such feistiness! Love to see it. Especially since the former president must know, or at least suspect, that he is spitting into the wind — shrieking at his minions to go hard on a poison-pill measure that has less chance of becoming law this season than JD Vance has of winding up the new V.P. of <a href="https://cfa.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Cat Fanciers’ Association</a>. (The poison pill is a measure to require proof of citizenship to vote, even though the law already forbids noncitizens from voting, and Republicans have never shown any evidence that this is a problem.)</p><p>Then again, it’s not totally unreasonable for Trump to expect Republican lawmakers to blindly do his bidding. I mean, earlier this year, they tanked a serious bipartisan bill on what is ostensibly one of the party’s top priorities — border security — because Trump told them that doing so was in his electoral interests. Why not then force a government shutdown in pursuit of a measure that would cast further doubt on the integrity of our election system?</p><p>I’ll tell you why not. Because a government shutdown in the final stretch of a tick-tight, high-stakes election cycle would be political madness — especially if it looked as though the shutdown occurred not because of substantive disagreements over spending but because Trump was bullying his congressional team into indulging his delusions about election fraud. Again.</p><p>MAGA die-hards might be jazzed. The rest of the electorate, not so much.</p><p>Republican lawmakers may be loath to upset their nominee, but they value nothing above their own political fortunes. Most of them aren’t stupid enough to sign up for this kind of self-immolation.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="10" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzQ4ZTFiMDlhLWNjMzItNThkMS1iOGQzLTk0NDMyYTQ2ZTc5Mg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#women-domestic-abuse" data-source-id="100000009677418"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alicia-p-q--wittmeyer"><img alt="Alicia P.Q.

I found this startling; this seemed like such a basic statistic. After I spoke about this at Stanford Law School in 2020, the executive directors of the Criminal Justice Center — Debbie Mukamal and David Sklansky — pushed for a large-scale survey of women in prison for homicide, which became the basis for the piece.</p><p><strong>Wittmeyer:</strong> What was it like being in a prison as a proctor instead of a journalist?</p><p><strong>Snyder:</strong> It was so humbling. Debbie made me go through training about not<em> </em>harming people while you’re talking with them and, honestly, I think it’s forever changed the way I interact with people. For example, when I do these incredibly intense interviews now, I never get off the phone with someone without asking what their plan is to take care of themselves. Will they call a friend? Go to church?</p><p>Doing this in person mattered. Formerly incarcerated women who were our consultants said that inmates get surveyed ad nauseam, especially through the mail: all these faceless, nameless people asking for the worst moment of their lives. Stanford ensured that clergy and/or a social worker was available on survey days so that the women would have some emotional support.</p><p><strong>Wittmeyer:</strong> I know the researchers hope to eventually expand their survey to every state in the country. Ambitious, important — daunting! Any sense of the states that might be next on their list?</p><p><strong>Snyder:</strong> To some extent, it depends on where we get permission — getting permission to do in-person research is a whole complicated process that, in our case, took nearly two years (in part, because of Covid).</p><p>California, Florida and Texas contain a huge percentage of the women who are incarcerated for homicide nationwide. But Texas is complicated because its facilities are smaller, and a survey would require visiting more of them, so just logistically it’s difficult. There are states with certain laws that make them potentially interesting to us, like Oklahoma and Illinois, for example. But it costs money to do this kind of research, and no one wants to fund it, honestly.</p><p>As a society, we don’t like messy victims. The anti-domestic violence advocacy world prioritized resources for victims who don’t get convicted of committing crimes. Incarcerated women simply don’t have a ton of people on the outside really advocating for them among potential donors. So, in part, the next state will depend on who is willing to fund this research.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="9" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzIyOWY3NGYyLWRlZjUtNTMwOC04MDA5LWM3ODM2MDgzYzIxNg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#vance-smear-haitians-pets" data-source-id="100000009683082"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jamelle-bouie"><img alt="Jamelle Bouie" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/24/opinion/jamelle-bouie/jamelle-bouie-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/24/opinion/jamelle-bouie/jamelle-bouie-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/24/opinion/jamelle-bouie/jamelle-bouie-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-10T15:56:30.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 10, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Attracted by job opportunities around Springfield, Ohio, thousands of Haitian immigrants have migrated to the area in search of a better life. And while there have been real tensions — especially after a recent arrival caused a school bus crash that killed one child and injured 23 others — it is also true that the new Haitian community has revitalized a town that was on the path to terminal decline.</p><p>For every problem — the migrants have overwhelmed key city services — there are also opportunities for both newcomers and longtime residents. As my newsroom colleague Miriam Jordan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/us/springfield-ohio-school-bus-crash-haiti-immigrants.html" title="">detailed</a> in a recent article, Springfield is a microcosm for all that is good, and difficult, about immigration.</p><p>Part of this story is a furious backlash. Some of it is ordinary and even understandable resentment, and some of it emanates from the ugliest corners of American life. Last month, for example, an armed neo-Nazi group <a href="https://daytonjewishobserver.org/2024/08/hate-on-parade-in-springfield/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">marched</a> through Springfield denouncing Haitian immigrants in a display reminiscent of the deadly “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Unite the Right</a>” riot in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017.</p><p>A responsible leader would use the situation in Springfield — the anger and acrimony from some, as well as the decency and generosity from others — as an opportunity to try to bring people together and come, as much as possible, to a mutual understanding. A leader would see it as a chance to do democracy, to bring people together as equals so that they can figure out how to live together.</p><p>Senator JD Vance of Ohio is not that responsible leader.</p><p>Faced with troubles and tensions that could, under the wrong circumstances, escalate into outright violence, Vance fanned the flames.</p><p>In July, during a Senate committee hearing, Vance <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/us/politics/trump-vance-haitians-ohio.html" title="">referred to Springfield</a> as an example of how “high illegal immigration levels under the Biden administration” have raised housing costs, a highly contested assertion that rests on the false claim that the new Haitian residents of Springfield are undocumented. (The vast majority have legal residency under the Temporary Protected Status program.)</p><p>On Monday, Vance shared the outrageously false claim that Haitian immigrants in Springfield were abducting and eating their neighbor’s pets. “Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country,” <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1833148904864465117" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote Vance on X</a>. “Where is our border czar?”</p><p>Vance was amplifying a lie that has its origins in a viral, and entirely fabricated, social media post spread by <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/haitian-migrants-not-eating-cats-ohio-1235098109/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Malaysia-based right-wing influencer</a>. Springfield authorities <a href="https://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/springfield-police-say-no-reports-of-pets-stolen-after-viral-social-media-post/3WSIZQNHQVE4NP4TS5BVHBB2PY/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">say</a> there are “no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.” The Trump campaign has not provided evidence to support the claim.</p><p>On Tuesday, Vance <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1833505359513661762" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conceded</a> that the smears may “turn out to be false” but <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1833506757534175484" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">urged his followers</a> to continue spreading the lie.</p><p>Vance entered the political scene as a literary wunderkind of sorts. In highlighting this claim and spreading it to his followers on social media, he has shown that these days, he’s little more than a petty demagogue — the junior partner to another, even pettier demagogue.</p><p>The charge that a foreign people steal and eat pets is a classic attack meant to dehumanize its targets and legitimize persecution and removal. This is important to note because it comes just days after Donald Trump warned that the mass expulsion of immigrants from the United States — the centerpiece of his second-term agenda — will be a “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/09/trump-reiterates-there-will-be-blood/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bloody story</a>.”</p><p>JD Vance, it seems, is playing his part.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2FhMGRlODRmLTY2OWItNTZmMi1iNmZiLWI3NzBmNDMxOWI4NQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#harris-trouble-debate" data-source-id="100000009682878"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-healy"><img alt="Patrick Healy" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-10T11:47:07.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 10, 2024, 7:47 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>In 20 years of covering presidential politics, I never saw a run of buoyant campaign rallies, boffo fund-raising, ecstatic social media and rank-and-file rapture for a candidate like Kamala Harris had in July and August, capped off by her Democratic convention speech.

But most of all, I think, she didn’t leave strong positive impressions on undecided voters and lukewarm independents and Democrats.</p><p>The CNN interview looms large for me in part because Harris is running against a man who is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/11/opinion/editorials/donald-trump-2024-unfit.html" title="">unfit for office</a>, who did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/18/opinion/trump-presidency-record.html" title="">enormous damage</a> to the nation as president, who frequently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/us/politics/debate-trump-age-capacity.html" title="">veers into incoherence and lies</a> in his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/08/us/trump-press-conference-fact-check" title="">news conferences</a> and interviews — and yet who, <em>for all that</em>, is tied with Harris in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/us/politics/trump-and-harris-times-siena-poll.html" title="">leading</a> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harris-trump-poll-pennsylvania-michigan-wisconsin-debate/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">polls</a>.</p><p>Something seems to have happened in the past couple of weeks. As my newsroom colleague Nate Cohn <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/upshot/trump-harris-poll-analysis.html" title="">wrote</a> on Sunday: “Is Kamala Harris’s surge beginning to ebb?” CNN was one interview, not a trend, but I think it was revealing that a joy-driven campaign takes you only so far.</p><p>I checked in recently with our Times Opinion panel of young, undecided voters, which we are tracking through Election Day. Most in this group of 14 voters praised Harris’s convention speech; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/opinion/harris-trump-undecided-voters.html" title="">five said it made them more likely to vote for her</a>. By contrast, seven said her answers on CNN made them less likely to vote for her.</p><p>“Harris did a poor job of explaining how she would ease inflation,” said Laura, a 20-year-old legal intern in Maryland, who was one of those less likely to support Harris after the interview. Lillian, a 27-year-old Virginian who gave Harris strong marks for her convention speech, could not come up with one positive takeaway from the interview.</p><p>For most in our group, Tuesday’s debate is critical in choosing a candidate. They want a better handle on who she is; they want stronger answers that build trust in her.</p><p>Big tent-pole events have an outsize impact in a tight race. The debate is one of Harris’s best chances to win over the doubters and undecideds and energize her momentum against Trump. No debate has ever felt more important.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="6" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2FmZDRkYTRmLTdhMjQtNTQ4NC1iNDgzLTZmNWMxMWRmMThmMA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#sex-trafficking-hoax-reality" data-source-id="100000009681593"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jeneen-interlandi"><img alt="Jeneen Interlandi" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/01/opinion/jeneen-interlandi-author/jeneen-interlandi-author-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/01/opinion/jeneen-interlandi-author/jeneen-interlandi-author-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/01/opinion/jeneen-interlandi-author/jeneen-interlandi-author-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-09T20:43:27.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 9, 2024, 4:43 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Tim Ballard, the former Homeland Security agent who started a global anti-sex-trafficking nonprofit group that became the subject of a hit movie and made him an international superhero, is facing extremely credible charges of sexual predation and assault. His entire apparatus — Operation Underground Railroad, which claimed to conduct undercover rescue operations across the world — appears to be a grim ruse designed only to help Ballard (and possibly others) get access to and abuse women and children.</p><p>The charges, laid out in a searing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/us/tim-ballard-sound-of-freedom-sex-trafficking.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;sgrp=c-cb" title="">New York Times</a> investigation by Mike Baker on Monday, are as horrific as they are heartbreaking: Not only did the operation not rescue anyone, but by using loads of money to entice possible traffickers, Ballard’s scam actually helped create a market for more trafficking than might otherwise have occurred.</p><p>The revelations make Operation Underground Railroad just one more in a long roster of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9531675/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">false heroes and false narratives</a> to populate the national sex trafficking discourse. The sheer volume of such stories — from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/30/world/asia/anti-trafficking-activist-quits-amid-charges-stories-were-fabricated.html" title="">Somaly Mam</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/technology/fact-check-this-pizzeria-is-not-a-child-trafficking-site.html" title="">Pizzagate</a> — make it tempting to assume that the entire issue is a mere boogeyman, that sex trafficking really happens only in the heads of QAnon’s most fervent loyalists.</p><p>But that would be a mistake.</p><p>Here’s a true story: By the time he was caught by a cross-border task force this past April, a Florida pharmacist, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdfl/pr/local-pharmacist-charged-attempted-sex-trafficking-minor-and-child-sex-tourism" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stefan Andres Correa</a>, had traveled to Medellín, Colombia, 45 times in two years — to rape girls as young as 9. He paid a sex trafficker $75 to procure the children and according to court records offered $75 extra plus an iPhone to at least one of the girls “if she behaved.” The case captured headlines in the United States and Colombia for its egregiousness, but officials in both countries say that it was not an anomaly.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/the-dark-side-of-colombia-tourism-child-sex-trade-in-medellin-2c583fad" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal has reported</a>, the rise of work-anywhere digital nomads triggered by the pandemic and the growing perception of Medellín as a city that is finally safe for tourists have conspired to touch off a boom in child sex trafficking. The operation that led to Correa’s arrest turned up perpetrators from Florida to Ohio as well as some 250 underage victims, fewer than 100 of whom have been found and brought to safety so far.</p><p>The investigators working to track down the rest are up against dozens of crime syndicates — including an offshoot of the original Medellín cartel — and a slew of modern tools (Airbnb, digital encryption, cryptocurrency) that have made traffickers exceedingly difficult to apprehend.</p><p>They are also up against a profound blind spot. Encouraged by exploitative politicians like Donald Trump, Americans routinely work themselves up into a frenzy over the moral character of people entering their country. (Murderers! Sex traffickers! Bad hombres!) They pay considerably less attention to the havoc their countrymen bring to other nations when they leave here.</p><p>This is never more true than during election season. In the coming weeks, as anti-immigration rhetoric reaches its familiar fever pitch, voters and politicians alike will wring their hands anew over the type and number of people seeking to penetrate the United States’ southern border. They should bear in mind that an untold number of American men are flocking in the opposite direction, to commit exactly the kind of heinous acts they are most terrified of.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzM0NWUxOWM5LTM3OTctNTA5MS1iZWU3LWJjNzAwMjUzZDExNA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#north-carolina-democratic-women" data-source-id="100000009681605"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mara-gay"><img alt="Mara Gay" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/opinion/mara-gay-circular/mara-gay-circular-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/opinion/mara-gay-circular/mara-gay-circular-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/opinion/mara-gay-circular/mara-gay-circular-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-09T19:34:32.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 9, 2024, 3:34 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mara-gay" itemprop="name">Mara Gay</a></p><p>Editorial Board Member, reporting from Raleigh, N.C.</p></div></div></div></div><p>On the campaign trail here in Raleigh, N.C., Gwen Walz and Doug Emhoff turned on the charm on Monday afternoon.</p><p>Walz, in a peppy Midwestern lilt, encouraged Democrats to bake cookies for the volunteers at the phone bank for her husband, Tim Walz, and Kamala Harris. “We need treats!” she said. “And the next night, go in and make the calls yourself.”</p><p>Emhoff, the second gentleman, joked that he and Harris had resorted to going for a walk on the tarmac recently to try to spend some quality time together. “Aw,” several women cooed at the event, in Raleigh’s City Market.</p><p>The crowd of some 200 Democrats — largely women — received Gwen Walz and Emhoff warmly.

Fail to utter them or continue to disguise her policy shifts with the incoherent statement she used in the CNN interview — that while her positions might have changed on fracking and immigration, “<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/29/kamala-harris-cnn-interview-democrats" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my values have not changed</a>” — and she will struggle.</p><p>Madam V.P., if you say your positions have changed but your values haven’t, what does that even mean?

Our <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/us/politics/trump-and-harris-times-siena-poll.html" title="">latest poll</a> shows too many voters still don’t know.</p><p>It’s OK to say: “I learned a lot as vice president. I’m proud of our record of putting America on a sustainable path to a clean energy future. It will make us more secure and more prosperous. But I also see that we can’t get there overnight. For reasons of both economic security and national security, we need an all-of-the-above energy strategy right now. So you can trust that in a Harris presidency, America will continue to lead the world in exploiting our oil and gas advantages but we will do it in the cleanest way possible while making the transition as fast as possible.”</p><p>It’s OK to say: “President Biden and I inherited a cruel Trump border policy that included separating parents from their children. Maybe, out of an excess of compassion, we rolled it back too far. But we learned from it — we learned that only comprehensive, bipartisan immigration reform can give us the solution we need, controlling illegal immigration — while continuing to be a beacon for legal immigration. So our administration sat down with one of the most conservative Republicans in the Senate, James Lankford of Oklahoma, and hammered out a bipartisan immigration bill that would have done just that. And what did Trump do? <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/gop-senators-angry-trump-immigration-deal/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">He ordered Republicans to kill it,</a> so he could keep exploiting immigration as a wedge issue.

As James Carville recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/opinion/harris-trump-election.html" title="">put it</a> in a Times Opinion guest essay, “A leader who can openly admit a change in her understanding would feel like a breath of spring air for a lot of voters.”</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzQxOTQ5ZWJhLTk3ZWQtNThhNi05NDUzLTgyNzQ3YWMxMTE4Ng=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/11/opinion/thepoint#trump-harris-debate-poll" data-source-id="100000009680327"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katherine-miller"><img alt="Katherine Miller" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-09T09:04:08.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 9, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden on Sept. 29, 2020.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Watson/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Every Monday morning on The Point, we start the week with a tipsheet on the latest in the presidential campaign. Here’s what we’re looking at this week:</em></p><ul><li><p>It’s debate week. Presidential debates are sometimes explosive and shape the terrain of elections (like the one in June, or that first Biden-Trump debate in 2020). And sometimes they are intense, but except for a single moment that becomes a shorthand for a candidate’s appeal or limitations, they fade quickly from memory. Tuesday night’s debate may be the only one between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, who will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/harris-howard-university-debate-prep.html" title="">meet</a> for the first time. Will it change or harden how people view one or both of them, or will we be back where we began again this time next week?</p></li><li><p>As much as Harris’s newness and questions about her have shaped the last month, in the last week, Trump has called a news conference to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/us/politics/trump-news-conference-allegations.html" title="">revisit</a> years-old sexual misconduct allegations against him and attack the women who lodged them, and posted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/07/us/politics/trump-election-fraud-prosecute.html" title="">at length</a> about arresting various people if 2024 is like 2020, when he lost. That’s how Trump is, but is that how he’s going to be on the debate stage? More subdued, as he was in June, or more aggressive, as he was in 2020?</p><p>Last week, Trump’s <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-stumbles-whether-prioritize-child-care-costs-rcna169922" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">meandering answer</a> to a question about child-care costs wasn’t the first time he’s been asked about that in a public setting — he was basically <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/read-biden-trump-debate-rush-transcript/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked</a> the same question at the June debate and replied about something unrelated. The first debate ended up being consumed by President Biden’s awful performance and questions about his presidency, and voters’ expectations of Trump can seem fairly baked in, but not always. How he is on Tuesday could also shape the next few weeks in big ways.</p></li><li><p>On Sunday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/us/politics/trump-and-harris-times-siena-poll.html" title="">the latest Times/Siena poll</a> hit and, with Harris down a couple of points, there’s been some nervousness about choices her campaign has made in substance and strategy, though it’s hard to know anything certain in a race this close. On Tuesday, one of the more complex things she has to deal with is Biden’s presidency, which has often not been popular, but from which she hasn’t distanced herself too much, and can’t significantly do so anyway, since she’s a part of it.</p><p>Theoretically, the debate will force the issue a little bit, since debates tend to deal with the economic and foreign policy issues of the moment. But it’s often hard to know whether voters are looking for specific policies or a sense of command. Sounding decisive and clear about why she’s making decisions a certain way might be just as important on a debate stage as how she approaches some policy issues or broader questions.</p></li><li><p>After the debate, Harris will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/us/politics/harris-biden-trump-sept-11-nyc.html" title="">attend</a> the 9/11 memorial in New York on Wednesday, and Trump may as well; Harris will spend the rest of the week in the battleground states. But even though Trump’s public persona can overwhelm everything, by the end of Tuesday night, there really might be a clear contrast between them on subjects like the courts, gun control, artificial intelligence and NATO.</p></li></ul></div></div></section></div></div>
