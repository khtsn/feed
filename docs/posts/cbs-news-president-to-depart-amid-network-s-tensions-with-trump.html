Many legal experts have called the suit baseless, but Paramount’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/business/media/trump-paramount-mediator-60-minutes.html" title="">has said</a> she favors settling the case. She is seeking the Trump administration’s approval for a multibillion-dollar sale of her company to a Hollywood studio, Skydance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The situation prompted the executive producer of “60 Minutes,” Bill Owens, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/media/cbs-60-minutes-trump-bill-owens.html" title="">to resign last month</a>, saying he no longer enjoyed his usual journalistic independence. At the time, Ms. McMahon took pains to signal her support for Mr. Owens, saying that “standing behind” the producer “was an easy decision for me.”</p><p>Her embrace of Mr. Owens and “60 Minutes” put Ms. McMahon at odds with Paramount executives who were anxious about the show’s reporting about the Trump administration. Within CBS News, some journalists expected Ms. McMahon to be gone within months. But the timing of her announcement, less than 24 hours after Sunday’s season finale of “60 Minutes,” still raised eyebrows.</p><p>Ms. McMahon’s tenure atop CBS News, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/15/business/media/cbs-news-chief-executive-wendy-mcmahon.html" title="">she took over</a> in August 2023, has been rocky at times.</p><p>An overhaul of “CBS Evening News,” introduced earlier this year, has failed to connect with viewers, and ratings for the flagship newscast have fallen sharply. Besides the tussle with Mr. Trump, the news division also faced internal criticism from Ms. Redstone over a “60 Minutes” segment in January about the war between Israel and Hamas.</p><p>And Ms. Redstone <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/business/media/ta-nehisi-coates-cbs-interview-shari-redstone.html" title="">openly criticized</a> Ms. McMahon’s handling of an October incident involving the “CBS Mornings” anchor Tony Dokoupil, who in an interview had challenged the author Ta-Nehisi Coates’s views about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p><p>CBS News executives <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/business/media/coates-dokoupil-cbs-mornings.html" title="">rebuked</a> Mr. Dokoupil on a newsroom-wide call, saying his interview fell short of editorial standards. Ms. Redstone said that move was “a mistake” and that Mr. Dokoupil “did a great job with that interview.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael M.
