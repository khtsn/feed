Trump is likely to justify his plans to seal off the border with Mexico by citing a public health emergency from immigrants bringing disease into the United States.</p><p>Now he just has to find one.</p><p>Mr. Trump last invoked public health restrictions, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/14/us/migrants-condition-title-42-ends.html" title="">known as Title 42,</a> in the early days of the pandemic in 2020, when the coronavirus was tearing across the globe. As he prepares to enter office again, Mr. Trump has no such public health disaster to point to.</p><p>Still, his advisers have spent recent months trying to find the right disease to build their case, according to four people familiar with the discussions. They have looked at tuberculosis and other respiratory diseases as options and have asked allies inside the Border Patrol for examples of illnesses that are being detected among migrants.</p><p>They also have considered trying to rationalize Title 42 by arguing broadly that migrants at the border come from various countries and may carry unfamiliar disease — an assertion that echoes a racist notion with a long history in the United States that minorities transmit infections. Mr. Trump’s team did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The plan to invoke the border restrictions based on sporadic cases of illness or even a vague fear of illness — rather than a major disease outbreak or pandemic — would amount to a radical use of the public health measure in pursuit of an immigration crackdown. Even when the coronavirus was spreading, the use of the health authority to turn away migrants prompted scrutiny from the courts and public health officials.</p><p>But Mr. Trump’s immigration advisers, led by Stephen Miller, his pick to be deputy chief of staff, believe they are entering a political environment that will welcome more aggressive border enforcement, particularly after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/28/us/politics/covid-title-42-border-migrants-biden.html" title="">some Democrats embraced using restrictions</a> like Title 42, according to people familiar with the planning. President Biden used it to turn away thousands of migrants before eventually deciding to lift it, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/09/us/politics/biden-border-immigration.html" title="">well after his public health advisers said the restrictions were no longer useful</a> for the purpose of stopping the spread of disease.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
