for release on Friday could mark a turning point for the American economy, making it one of the most important and closely watched pieces of data in years.</p><p>The employment numbers will shed crucial light on whether a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/business/economy/july-jobs-report-what-to-know.html" title="">recent jump</a> in the unemployment rate, which tracks the share of people who are looking for work but have not yet found it, was a blip or the start of a problematic trend.</p><p>The jobless rate rose notably in July after a year of creeping higher. If that continued in August, economists are likely to increasingly worry that the United States may be in — or nearing — the early stages of a recession. But if the rate stabilized or ticked down, as economists forecast, July’s weak numbers are likely to be viewed as a false alarm.</p><p>The answer is coming at a pivotal moment, as the Federal Reserve moves toward its first rate cut since the 2020 pandemic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Central bankers have been clear that they will lower interest rates at their meeting on Sept. 17-18. Whether that cut is a normal quarter-point reduction or a larger half-point move <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/business/economy/fed-rates-powell-jackson-hole.html" title="">could hinge on</a> how well the job market is holding up. It is rare for so much to ride on a single data point.</p><p>“It matters a lot,” said Julia Coronado, founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives, a research firm. “It’s going to set the tone for the Fed, and that’s going to set the tone for global monetary policy and markets.”</p><p>The question is what the data will show.</p><p>The job market has clearly cooled in recent months. Most notably, the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unemployment rate</a> rose to 4.3 percent in July, up from 3.4 percent as recently as April 2023. That leaves joblessness higher than it was heading into the 2020 pandemic, and the speed of the recent pickup has drawn the attention of both Fed officials and economists who study the labor market.</p><p>“We do not seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/business/economy/fed-rates-powell-jackson-hole.html" title="">his latest speech</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Big and rapid increases in unemployment rarely happen outside recessions, which is why the recent pop has garnered so much attention.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="datawrapper_kEmMK" data-id="100000009674415" data-source-id="100000009674415"></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Those concerns have been compounded by other signs of the labor market’s slowing. <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTSJOL" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Job openings</a> have been steadily declining after soaring in 2021 and 2022, and are nearing their prepandemic level. Unemployment is <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=1tpaN" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rising swiftly</a> for people who tend to struggle to find work or lose jobs when the labor market is starting to weaken, including Black workers and people in their early 20s.</p><p>But there are reasons to think that the job market is not collapsing but simply returning to normal after a spurt of strong labor demand. Many economists have viewed the recent slowdown as a benign moderation.</p><p>That’s partly because some signs hint that July’s weak jobs report was a fluke.</p><p>For instance, the number of people who lost jobs because they were <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=1tph5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">temporarily laid off</a> surged in July. When that happens, it typically reverses in the next report — even bigger jumps in those who experienced temporary layoffs in August 2010 and October 2013 <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=1tphm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quickly</a> disappeared. It bears noting, though, that when a jump in temporary layoffs did not fade quickly, like in <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=1tq5Z" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">early 1980</a>, the economy was in recession.</p><p>Plus, bad weather may have been behind the spike in July layoffs.</p><p>While some analysts initially speculated that Hurricane Beryl might have kept people at home that month, both the Bureau of Labor Statistics and economists at Goldman Sachs have said that was probably not the case. Temporary layoffs came from the Midwest and California, not the hurricane-suffering South. But high temperatures could have caused part of the trend.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“It seems possible that some of them are linked to extreme heat in California,” said David Mericle, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs.</p><p>Even if July wasn’t an anomaly, there are plenty of other signs that the job market is holding up.</p><p>“Base line is that things will be fine,” Mr. Mericle said, explaining that labor demand is returning to normal after a very hot period but not freezing up altogether. “It looks more like 2019 strong than 2022 strong.”</p><p><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICSA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jobless claims</a> remain low, though they have been nudging higher. WARN notices, which give early warning about mass layoffs, have yet to increase sharply, according to Goldman Sachs data.</p><p>For the White House, even a gradually weakening job market could dim the most important bright spot in the Biden administration’s economic record.</p><p>But that comes with a trade-off: If a slowing economy translates into faster Fed rate cuts, those cheaper borrowing costs could make voters feel better. Christopher Krueger, managing director of TD Cowen’s Washington Research Group, said he thought that voters were most focused on the outlook for interest rates and the recent slowdown in price increases.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“At the end of the day, it’s still price at the pump, groceries and what a Happy Meal costs,” he said. In line with that, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/08/02/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-the-july-jobs-report/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">immediately focused</a> on the fact that price increases had also been cooling when jobs growth slowed last month.</p><p>In fact, the election itself could be behind some of the hiring slowdown, based on an anecdote in the Fed’s so-called <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_20240904.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Beige Book</a>, which is a collection of business and worker experiences from around the country.</p><p>In the New York region, “hiring has shifted to be primarily for replacement, rather than growth, and with uncertainty pertaining to the presidential election ahead, many firms have put hiring plans on hold,” the report said.</p><p>Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, came up with <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the popular rule</a> suggesting that a sudden increase in unemployment signals a recession. But even though the recent jump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/05/business/stocks-market-crash-economy#the-sahm-rule-points-to-a-recession-heres-what-the-rule-maker-thinks" title="">has triggered her rule</a>, she does not think it is a sign of an impending downturn this time. That is in part because the rise has come as many new people have entered the job market and taken time to make their way into positions.</p><p>Still, Ms. Sahm said the slowdown in demand for labor was a reason to worry. Even if it doesn’t cause an economic crash, it means that would-be workers are stuck on the sidelines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“What is very concerning about the labor market right now is the direction it’s traveling,” she said. “My base case is not a recession, and there are a lot of reasons I think that’s not where we are headed — yet that is such a low bar for success.”</p><p>When the labor market weakens even a little bit, she said, “there are costs.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jeanna Smialek covers the Federal Reserve and the economy for The Times from Washington.<span> </span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/federal-reserve-the-fed">Federal Reserve (The Fed)</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
