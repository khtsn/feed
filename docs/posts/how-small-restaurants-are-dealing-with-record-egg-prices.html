    <h1>How Small Restaurants Are Dealing With Record Egg Prices</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p><em>“Making It Work” is a series about small-business owners striving to endure hard times.</em></p><hr/><p>Bird flu outbreaks that wiped out about 15 percent of the nation’s egg-laying chickens and drove wholesale egg prices to a peak of more than $8.50 a dozen in February have vexed grocery shoppers and prompted big breakfast chains to add surcharges to diners’ checks. But for owners of small eateries, paying double or triple for an ingredient they crack by the hundreds each day could potentially put them out of business.</p><p>These business owners are getting creative: changing recipes; using liquid or powdered eggs, which haven’t gotten as expensive as quickly; and selling whatever items they can that don’t include eggs — things like falafel or packaged snacks or even fresh flowers.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/business/egg-prices-wholesale.html" title="">Prices</a> have come down in recent weeks but remain historically high, and worry about new outbreaks is keeping business owners on edge. The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicted on Tuesday that egg prices would climb <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly 58 percent</a> this year. Food trends like all-day breakfast menus and protein-heavy diets are keeping demand — and therefore prices — high, according to analysts at CoBank, a bank that lends to farmers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Eggs are too perishable to be stockpiled and small businesses generally don’t have extra cash for refrigerator space to keep extra eggs even for brief periods, said Rob Handfield, a professor and the director of the Supply Chain Resource Cooperative at North Carolina State University.</p><p>“It’s not like you can stock up on a month’s worth of eggs,” he said. “You really rely on those weekly or daily deliveries of eggs if you’re a small business.”</p><p>Restaurant and bakery owners could charge more for their baked goods or breakfast sandwiches, but they fear that hiking prices will drive away customers.</p><p>“That’s the big challenge for a lot of owners right now,” said Holly Wade, executive director of the NFIB Research Center at the National Federation of Independent Business.</p><p>Here’s how the owners of four small businesses are trying to be creative in adapting to the jump in egg prices.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-4"><div><figcaption><span>Eggs are the star of the Square Diner’s signature omelets and of its “lumberjack” breakfast platter.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Dolly Faibyshev for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><h2 id="link-5b039454">Square Diner, New York City</h2></p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-6"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="square-diner-egg-embed" data-id="100000010050615" data-source-id="100000010050615"><div slug="square-diner-egg-embed" data-sourceid="100000010050615" id="embed-id-100000010050615">

During the pandemic, prices spiked as high as $100 a case.</p><p>Today, Mr. Karounos would be thrilled with that price. “This year’s been scary,” he said. “I’ve never seen $200 before.” Now, he is paying $239 per case — a nonnegotiable cost, considering that he serves about 360 eggs a day at the Square Diner, a classic restaurant with booths, a long row of counter stools and vintage signs adorning the walls.</p><p>Eggs are the star of the diner’s signature omelets and of the “lumberjack” breakfast platter that includes eggs and pancakes, which also incorporate eggs in the batter. In total, Mr. Karounos estimated that about 60 percent of his menu included eggs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Karounos raised prices 7.5 percent last year to keep pace with inflation, he said, and is considering hiking them again. The margins on something as workaday as a two-egg breakfast have shrunk drastically, he said: “You’re talking about a dollar per plate of lost profit.”</p><p>“This is not an ingredient we can go without,” he added. “Right now we’re just absorbing the hit.”</p><h2 id="link-125eec3e">Oh My Cupcakes!, Sioux Falls, S.

That’s not unexpected for a bakery, but Ms. Johnson, founder and chief executive of Oh My Cupcakes! in Sioux Falls, S.D., said the price of eggs led her to add other types of inventory.</p><p>“The more items we can come up with that don’t include eggs but still supplement our income, the better off we’ll be,” she said. She has added bags of snack mix and dry pancake batter mix to the shelves, along with gift items like candles and fresh flowers.</p><p>Ms. Johnson considered adding a surcharge to offset some of the increase in egg costs.

Recently, the cost of eggs prompted her to halve the number of fried eggs in her signature maple-sausage-and-cheddar biscuit sandwich down to one, and to set a daily market price for eggs ordered on the side ($6.50 for two eggs in mid-March).</p><p>Side Piece’s weekly specials no longer feature eggs, Ms. Hernandez said. “We’re spending more time really transforming ingredients” to elevate cheap items like chickpeas into an appetizing dish, she said. “This week we made falafel from scratch.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
