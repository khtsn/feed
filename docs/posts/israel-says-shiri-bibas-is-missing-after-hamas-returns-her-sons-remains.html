And later it would be revealed that only three of the four were actually returned. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At a grotesque handover ceremony in Gaza on Thursday morning, with loud music blaring in the background, the coffins were put on display on a podium bearing images from family photos that were also used in Israel for hostage posters: Ariel in a little white polo shirt; Kfir with a wide, toothless grin clutching a bright pink cuddly toy; and Shiri Bibas, smiling and radiant before the family’s world fell in.</p><p>The masked gunmen, though, appeared to have mixed up the children’s pictures and names.</p><p>In the early hours of Friday morning, the Israeli military announced in a statement that the remains of Ariel and Kfir had been positively identified by Israel’s National Center of Forensic Medicine and the Israel police.</p><p>Mr. Lifshitz’s body had been positively identified earlier on Thursday.</p><p>But in a shocking and gut-wrenching twist, the military said that the identification process had determined that the additional body received was not that of Shiri Bibas, and that no match was found for any other hostage. “This is an anonymous, unidentified body,” the military said, calling the apparent ruse a “violation of utmost severity” of Hamas’s cease-fire agreement with Israel.</p><p>The revelation, which came as most Israelis were probably sleeping, was likely to further jolt the country, jeopardize the cease-fire and prolong the collective agony surrounding the Bibas tragedy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Yarden Bibas, Ms. Bibas’s husband and the children’s father, was abducted separately during the Oct. 7 assault, bleeding from a head wound. He was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-hostages-gaza.html" title="">released</a> alive this month as part of the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas that came into effect in January.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yarden Bibas being handed over this month.

Ms. Bibas’s elderly parents were also killed in the October 2023 attack.</p><p>“Dear citizens of Israel, on this day we are all united in grief that is too heavy to bear,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday, in a somber message to an aching nation. “Today, every home in Israel bows its head.”</p><p>A month after the war set off by the Hamas attack began, the group’s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, claimed that Ms. Bibas and her two children had been killed in an Israeli airstrike. Fears grew in Israel when they were not among the other captive mothers and children released during a weeklong cease-fire that month.</p><p>But the Israeli authorities had not confirmed their deaths, let alone the circumstances, saying only that there was “grave concern” over the hostages’ fates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Relatives held out hope until the very end.</p><p>After Hamas announced on Tuesday that it would release the Bibases’ remains, the family expressed anger over the early eulogizing in the news media of Ms. Bibas and the children before Israel had even determined that they had been killed.</p><p>“Should we receive devastating news, it must come through the proper official channels after all identification procedures are completed,” the family said in a statement on Wednesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hamas handing over the bodies of four Israeli hostages to the Red Cross in the Gazan city of Khan Younis on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Israeli military’s statement on Friday said that the available intelligence and forensic findings indicated that the two Bibas boys had been “brutally murdered by terrorists in captivity in 2023,” without elaborating. The Israeli government did not immediately provide details of the cause of Mr. Lifshitz’s death, but said he had been “murdered in captivity” by Islamic Jihad, a smaller Palestinian armed group that has been holding a number of hostages. Hamas asserted that Mr. Lifshitz, too, had been killed in an Israeli airstrike. None of the claims could be independently verified.</p><p>Hamas turned over the bodies as part of a series of negotiated exchanges in the first phase of the cease-fire agreement. In recent weeks it has released 19 living Israeli hostages.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The agreement provides for the release of 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for more than 1,500 Palestinian imprisoned in Israel during the first phase, which, barring an extension, is set to expire in early March.</p><p>The Israeli government said last month that Hamas had provided a list indicating that 25 of the 33 hostages were alive and that eight had been killed.</p><p>Roughly 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas-led 2023 attack and more than 250 abducted, according to Israel. Nir Oz was one of the hardest-hit communities, with about a quarter of its 400 residents either killed or taken hostage. Kfir was the youngest to be seized.</p><p>The attack prompted Israel to declare war on Hamas and invade Gaza in a 15-month military campaign that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians and combatants and left much of the coastal enclave in ruins.</p><p>On Thursday, groups of Israelis stood in the rain and held silent vigils along the route as the four coffins were transferred in a convoy from Gaza to the National Center of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A vigil in Tel Aviv on Thursday, hours after the bodies of four Israeli hostages were returned home,</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Oded Balilty/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Eylon Keshet, Mr. Bibas’s cousin, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-child-hostages-families.html" title="">described</a> Ariel in November 2023 as a boy who loved being the center of attention and playing with toy tractors and cars.
