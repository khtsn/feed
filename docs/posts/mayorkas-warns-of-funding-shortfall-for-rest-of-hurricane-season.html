    <h1>Mayorkas Warns of Funding Shortfall for Rest of Hurricane Season</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>And on Tuesday, a bipartisan group of 12 senators from the states affected by Helene <a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/10124disastersupplementalletterfinal.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">urged colleagues in a letter</a> to be prepared to return from recess and send the agency more funding.</p><p>“Although the true level of devastation is still unfolding, it is clear that Congress must act to meet the unmet needs in our states and address the scope and scale of destruction experienced by our constituents,” the letter said. “This may even require Congress to come back in October to ensure we have enough time to enact legislation before the end of this calendar year.”</p><p>While the stopgap bill Mr. Biden signed into law last week contained an additional $16 billion for FEMA, preliminary assessments of the damage from Moody’s and others predict a cleanup effort that could cost tens of billions.</p><p>As Mr. Biden traveled to South Carolina on Wednesday to extend his support, Mr. Mayorkas described a sprawling response that included airdrops of food and other aid, and the deployment of more than 6,000 members of the National Guard in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.</p><p>“We are meeting the moment, but that doesn’t speak about the future and the fact, as I mentioned earlier, that these extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and severity,” Mr. Mayorkas said. “We have to be funded for the sake of the American people — this is not a political issue.”</p></div></div>
