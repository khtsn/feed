The hostilities have also forced more than 150,000 people on both sides of the border to leave their homes for temporary shelters. That has put pressure on the Israeli government to make the north of the country safe for residents again by pushing Hezbollah back from the border region.</p><p>The pagers that exploded across Lebanon on Tuesday came a day after Israeli leaders warned that they were considering stepping up their military campaign against Hezbollah. Israel hasn’t commented on whether it was behind the attacks, but tensions between the two countries were already rising.</p><p>Here’s a look at Hezbollah and what a wider war would mean for Lebanon.</p><h2 id="link-7810ae94">What is Hezbollah?</h2><p>Hezbollah has opposed Israel since the group’s very beginnings. It was founded in the 1980s, after Israel, responding to attacks, invaded and occupied southern Lebanon, intending to root out the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was then based in the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But Israel soon ran into a new enemy, one whose guerrilla fighters quickly grew effective at bedeviling the far-better-equipped Israeli forces: Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim popular movement that made driving Israel out of Lebanon a major goal.</p><p>By 2000, Israel had withdrawn from Lebanon, making Hezbollah a hero to many Lebanese. It fought Israel again in 2006, launching a military operation into its southern neighbor that led to a fierce counterattack. In that war, Israel rained bombs on southern Lebanon and Beirut, the capital; the fighting killed more than 1,000 Lebanese.</p><p>Yet, the Israeli military never managed to overwhelm Hezbollah in 34 days of war, allowing the group and its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, to emerge as stars in an Arab world wearily accustomed to being defeated by Israel.</p><p>Hezbollah soon allied with Iran, and they became close partners.</p><p>Though the group retains a large and loyal following among Shiite Muslims because of the social services and political power it offers them — as well as the authoritarian tactics it uses to quell any dissent — many Lebanese see the group as an obstacle to progress that keeps threatening to drag the country into an unwanted war.</p><p>Hezbollah, considered a terrorist group by the United States and other countries, has evolved from a fighting force into a dominant political one, accruing significant influence in Lebanon’s government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-51d24701">What would a wider war mean for Lebanon?</h2><p>Lebanon can hardly afford a new conflict with Israel.</p><p>The country is reeling from years of an economic crisis that has left countless Lebanese in poverty and a political one that has stripped citizens of many basic services. The strikes at the border have displaced about 100,000 Lebanese civilians, depriving many of their income and their homes, and have cost the country billions of dollars in lost tourism and agricultural revenue, Lebanese officials say.</p><p>Even some of Hezbollah’s traditionally loyal Shiite Muslim constituents in southern Lebanon are questioning the price of the current fighting. As a result, analysts say, Mr. Nasrallah knows he has to step carefully. He has said that Hezbollah does not want a broader conflict, while warning that his fighters are prepared for one — and that Israel will face serious consequences if it comes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A fresh market in Beirut last year.

Such a conflict could draw in Iran, as well as the United States, which has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/us/politics/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-iran.html" title="">working to avert</a> further escalation.</p><p>Though jitters have grown with the frequency and deadliness of each side’s strikes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/world/middleeast/lebanon-israel-hezbollah.html" title="">Israel, Hezbollah and Iran do not want a full-fledged war</a>, analysts and U.S. officials say. Yet, the only near-certain way to avoid one, they say, is to end the fighting in Gaza with a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas, whose Oct. 7 attack led to the war in the enclave.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-706ed708">How strong is Hezbollah?</h2><p>Through propaganda videos and calibrated strikes, Hezbollah has repeatedly displayed signs of a <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/coming-conflict-hezbollah" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bulked-up arsenal</a> that analysts say is capable of inflicting heavy damage on Israeli cities. Its forces are also battle-tested after years of fighting against rebels in Syria, where Hezbollah sent thousands of fighters during that country’s civil war to help prop up the government of President Bashar al-Assad, a close ally of Iran and Hezbollah.</p><p>Estimates vary about just how many missiles Hezbollah has and just how sophisticated its systems are. The Central Intelligence Agency’s World Factbook says the group may have more than 150,000 missiles and rockets of various types and ranges. It also estimated that the group had up to 45,000 fighters, though Mr. Nasrallah has claimed to have 100,000.</p><p>But analysts and Israeli officials say Hezbollah’s arsenal is considerably more dangerous than Hamas’s because of its precision-guided missiles, which could target critical Israeli infrastructure and military assets.</p><p>Hezbollah has also displayed exploding drones that can elude Israel’s Iron Dome, the detect-and-shoot-down system designed to protect the country from incoming rockets and missiles. The group also appears to have anti-tank missiles that fly too fast and too low for the Iron Dome to intercept.</p><p>Euan Ward<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vivian Yee is a Times reporter covering North Africa and the broader Middle East.
