These beats informed everything — the costumes, hair, and overall silhouette.” She added: “We’re not aiming for a one-to-one recreation but rather an interpretation that captures his essence.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Willem Dafoe and Lily Rose Depp were able to transform into inhabitants of 19th-century Europe, thanks to Linda Muir’s research.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Focus Features</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p><strong>About the costumes:</strong> For “Nosferatu,” Robert Eggers’s otherworldly vampire movie, Ms. Muir engaged in meticulous research to create the film’s decadent Gothic wardrobe.
