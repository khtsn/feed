    <h1>After 120 Years Stored in a Museum, an Indigenous Shrine Returns Home</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>In the early 1900s, Franz Boas, who is considered one of the founders of American anthropology, became fascinated by a large shrine associated with Indigenous whaling rituals off the coast of British Columbia.</p><p>He had been sent a photograph of the shrine, which belonged to members of an Indigenous group called the Mowachaht. It showed a wooden structure on a small island, surrounded by a tangle of cedar and spruce, that sheltered 88 carved wooden human figures, four carved whale figures and 16 human skulls.</p><p>Boas decided to acquire it for the American Museum of Natural History in New York, where he was a curator. He was driven by a concept known as <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/the-eye/2023/04/30/a-century-later-columbia-excavates-salvage-anthropology/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“salvage anthropology,”</a> in which researchers saw collecting Native cultural possessions as a way to safeguard them from destruction as Indigenous populations plummeted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Even at the time, the acquisition was controversial. A researcher named George Hunt traveled to Yuquot, a village near the shrine, to try to purchase it for the museum. According to letters between him and Boas that were published in “The Yuquot Whalers’ Shrine,” Aldona Jonaitis’s <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Yuquot_Whalers_Shrine/fbTVsM7gpXAC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;printsec=frontcover" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1999 book</a> on the subject, a chief agreed to sell it for $500, only to return the money the next day following objections from his community.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/31/multimedia/00cul-shrine-repat-mwql/00cul-shrine-repat-mwql-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/31/multimedia/00cul-shrine-repat-mwql/00cul-shrine-repat-mwql-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/31/multimedia/00cul-shrine-repat-mwql/00cul-shrine-repat-mwql-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A black-and-white image of carved wooden figures under a wooden structure among the trees." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/31/multimedia/00cul-shrine-repat-mwql/00cul-shrine-repat-mwql-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/31/multimedia/00cul-shrine-repat-mwql/00cul-shrine-repat-mwql-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/31/multimedia/00cul-shrine-repat-mwql/00cul-shrine-repat-mwql-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/31/multimedia/00cul-shrine-repat-mwql/00cul-shrine-repat-mwql-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/3acdf1c0-816c-5d5c-8af0-a6317144d454" decoding="async" width="600" height="440"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photograph of the Whalers’ Shrine at its original home: a remote island off the coast of British Columbia.

But he added that the chiefs made him agree not to take the shrine until much of the community had left the island for the Bering Sea, where they often went seal hunting.</p><p>In 1905, the same year that the full collection arrived in New York, Boas left the museum. The museum ultimately decided not to exhibit the large shrine in its entirety. For the next 120 years, it sometimes displayed or lent out some of the carvings, and it created a small model that was on view from the early 1940s to around 2019. Mostly, the shrine was kept in storage.</p><p>Its loss was keenly felt by the community it came from, now known as the Mowachaht/Muchalaht First Nation. For decades, there have been calls to repatriate the shrine, and talks over its fate, but those plans never came to fruition.</p><p>Until now.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of the Mowachaht/Muchalaht First Nation gather for a victory song at the museum during an event for the shrine’s repatriation.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Terna for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Thursday, a truck containing the many pieces that make up the shrine began its long journey to Vancouver Island, off the southwest coast of Canada, in one of the most significant international repatriations in the museum’s history.</p><p>“We’re ready for it to come home,” said Marsha Maquinna, who is eight generations removed from the Mowachaht chief who presided over the shrine in the early 1900s. “We, as a community, have lots to heal.”</p><p>The story of the shrine’s return can be attributed in large part to the museum’s changing approach to its Native collections and the human remains it holds. And it involved an unlikely pair of facilitators: a father and son from California who only recently discovered their connection to the First Nation through Ancestry.com.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Three members of the Mowachaht/Muchalaht First Nation and three officials with the museum signed a document transferring ownership of the shrine.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Terna for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-9"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Margaretta James has been involved in efforts to repatriate the shrine for more than 30 years.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Terna for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jerry Jack, a hereditary chief, signs a document transferring the shrine’s ownership to the Mowachaht/Muchalaht First Nation.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Terna for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Like other major American institutions, the museum had long been criticized for its history of slow progress on repatriation and outdated Native exhibitions.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Efforts to address those criticisms have been going on for years, but the museum’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/06/arts/design/natural-history-museum-sean-decatur.html" title="">new president</a>, Sean Decatur, sent a signal that he took them very seriously last year when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/arts/design/american-museum-of-natural-history-nagpra.html" title="">he closed down two major halls</a> exhibiting Native American objects. He cited a “growing urgency” for museums to change their relationships to Indigenous cultures.</p><p>When it comes to Native human remains, funerary objects and other cultural items recovered in the United States, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/06/arts/design/native-american-remains-museums-nagpra.html" title="">a law passed in 1990</a> set up a protocol for museums and other institutions to repatriate the holdings in consultation with tribes and descendants. New <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/arts/design/native-displays-museums-law.html" title="">federal rules</a> that strengthened aspects of the protocol took effect last year. But the law does not apply to international Native groups.</p><p>Of the human remains that the museum still holds, more than half of the 12,000 individuals represented are from outside the U.S. In 2023, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/15/arts/american-museum-natural-history-human-remains.html" title="">the museum overhauled its stewardship</a> of the human remains in its collection, emphasizing its commitment to working with communities internationally on repatriation.</p><p>Last year, talks to repatriate the shrine — known to some as the Whalers’ Shrine and to others as the <a href="https://rabble.ca/indigenous/the-whalers-washing-house-finally-coming-home/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Whalers’ Washing House</a> because of its association with purification rituals — took on new urgency.</p><p>They had been going on for decades. In the 1990s, representatives from the Mowachaht/Muchalaht First Nation visited the museum to view the collection. Amid a surge of activism around Native repatriation, calls to return the shrine grew louder.</p><p>A 1994 documentary about the First Nation, called <a href="https://www.nfb.ca/film/washing-of-tears/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“The Washing of Tears,”</a> captured the view that the repatriation of the shrine would be a source of spiritual healing for a community trying to save its culture and ways of life.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The many pieces that make up the shrine — including the wood-paneled roof that sheltered it — were packaged for a long trip back to Vancouver Island.

He referred to the shrine by a traditional name: cheesum.</p><p>“I think that when that cheesum was taken away from us it was a real shocker for our people,” he said. “It took away our spirituality.”</p><p>In the years that followed there were waves <a href="https://hashilthsa.com/news/2013-05-06/feds-must-step-plate-return-yuquot-whalers-shrine" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">of efforts</a> to complete the repatriation, but plans kept stalling.</p><p>At times there were disagreements among members of the First Nation over how to carry out the return. And museum officials did not put forward many solutions.</p><p>Then, a few years ago, Albert Lara, a retiree living near Sacramento, Calif., began digging into his genealogy. Lara’s grandfather had told him stories as a child about his Indigenous heritage, but Lara, 75, was not aware of his connection to the Pacific Northwest until he sent a cheek swab to Ancestry.com. The results suggested a connection to members of the Mowachaht/Muchalaht First Nation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Margaretta James (second from left) stands with First Nation members including Jerry Jack (far right), a hereditary chief.
