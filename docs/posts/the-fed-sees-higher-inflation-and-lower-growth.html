    <h1>The Fed Sees Higher Inflation and Lower Growth</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, this afternoon offered an assessment of the U.S. economy that probably sounded familiar to many Americans who have struggled to make sense of President Trump’s whipsawing approach to tariffs. “In the current situation,” Powell said, “uncertainty is remarkably high.”</p><p>His comments came as the Fed announced its decision to leave interest rates unchanged for a second straight meeting. Powell and other Fed officials emphasized that many economic indicators, including the labor market, remained strong. They stuck to their previous forecast for two more rate cuts this year even as they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/19/business/fed-interest-rates" title="">projected higher inflation and slower growth</a>.</p><p>Our colleague Colby Smith, who covers the Fed, told us that “the meeting was a pivotal one in terms of the Fed’s willingness to acknowledge how significantly Trump’s economic agenda could impact how it will be able to adjust interest rates going forward.”</p><p>Powell, who had so far steered mostly clear of commenting on Trump’s policies, said that “progress may be delayed” in bringing down inflation because of the president’s tariffs, which he said “tend to bring growth down” and “inflation up.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Many analysts have blamed the uncertainty surrounding tariffs for the stock market’s recent slump (though the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/19/business/fed-interest-rates#stocks-jump-as-fed-stays-on-a-predicted-path" title="">S&amp;P 500 rose 1.1 percent</a> today). However, as our colleague Alan Rappeport wrote, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/business/trump-tariffs-economy.html" title="">the uncertainty may be the point</a>: The president’s unpredictable approach gives him leverage when negotiating with foreign leaders.</p><p><strong>In related news, </strong>Trump’s decision last night to fire the Democrats on the F.T.C. renewed fears that he might try to target the Fed’s independence. The central bank’s current stance <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/business/economy/trump-federal-reserve-rates-tariffs.html" title="">seems destined to stoke Trump’s anger</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A power plant in eastern Ukraine that was hit by Russian strikes this week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-6f00bcca">Zelensky agreed to a limited cease-fire</h2><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine agreed during a call with Trump to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/europe/zelensky-trump-ukraine-russia-putin.html?smid=url-share" title="">pause attacks on Russian energy infrastructure</a> for 30 days as part of a limited cease-fire deal also backed by Russia. It is not clear when the pause will take effect. With both sides on board, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Michael Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, said that teams would meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to discuss broadening the cease-fire to cover activity in the Black Sea. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>During the call, Trump also floated the idea of the United States taking control of Ukrainian power plants — an idea that Ukrainian energy experts said was probably unworkable. </p><p><strong>For more: </strong>Trump’s call yesterday with Vladimir Putin made clear that he had not retreated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/europe/trump-putin-call-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">from his maximalist aims</a>, our colleague Paul Sonne writes. </p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The University of Pennsylvania’s campus in Philadelphia. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rachel Wisniewski for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-2d4597e2">White House plans to suspend $175 million bound for Penn</h2><p>The Trump administration said today that it would suspend about $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/politics/trump-to-pause-175-million-for-university-of-pennsylvania-over-transgender-policy.html" title="">because of its approach to transgender athletes</a>.
