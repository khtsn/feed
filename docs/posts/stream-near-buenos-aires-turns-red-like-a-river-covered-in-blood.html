    <h1>Stream Near Buenos Aires Turns Red, ‘Like a River Covered in Blood’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Maria Ducomls, who has lived in the area for more than 30 years, told <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250207-a-stream-turns-blood-red-in-argentina-residents-blame-pollution" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Agence France-Presse</a> that she noticed that the stream had turned red after a strong smell woke her up. The Argentine newspaper <a href="https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/el-arroyo-sarandi-tenido-de-rojo-se-esperan-los-resultados-del-analisis-y-se-repiten-las-quejas-de-nid07022025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">La Nación</a> described it as a “nauseating smell, like garbage.”</p><p>“It looked like a river covered in blood,” Ms. Ducomls said.</p><p>She said that the stream had turned other strange colors over the years — bluish, greenish, purplish, pink — and that it sometimes had an oily sheen. “It’s terrible,” she said, blaming pollution for the changing colors.</p><p>Moira Zellner, a professor of public policy and urban affairs at Northeastern University, who grew up in Buenos Aires and worked as an environmental consultant on river and land remediation projects there in the 1990s, blamed “chronic lack of regulation and lack of enforcement” for the region’s pollution problems.</p><p>“Unfortunately, I’m not too surprised,” she said of the red color of the stream in Sarandí. “There’s a huge, long history of pollution in the rivers of Buenos Aires, and it’s really heartbreaking. I know some of the populations that have settled there are really suffering from the consequences.”</p><p>Carlos Colángelo, the president of the Professional Council of Chemistry for the Province of Buenos Aires, told a local news outlet, <a href="https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/2025/02/06/un-arroyo-se-tino-de-rojo-en-avellaneda-y-los-vecinos-denuncian-constantes-derrames-toxicos/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">infobae.com</a>, that he was concerned that chemicals could have been dumped into the stream.</p></div></div>
