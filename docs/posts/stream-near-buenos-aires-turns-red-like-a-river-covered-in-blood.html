The Matanza-Riachuelo River basin, for example, has been called <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2023/09/25/navega-a-traves-de-la-mega-obra-de-saneamiento-del-rio-matanza-riachuelo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of the most polluted</a> waterways in Latin America. Officials have announced major public works projects to prevent sewage and industrial discharges from entering the basin.</p><p>The environmental ministry for the Province of Buenos Aires said in a statement that it responded on Thursday morning to a report that the stream in Sarandí was red and that it had taken water samples for testing. It said that the freakish hue could have been the result of “some type of organic dye.” A ministry spokeswoman said on Friday that results of the testing were not yet available.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Maria Ducomls, who has lived in the area for more than 30 years, told <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250207-a-stream-turns-blood-red-in-argentina-residents-blame-pollution" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Agence France-Presse</a> that she noticed that the stream had turned red after a strong smell woke her up. The Argentine newspaper <a href="https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/el-arroyo-sarandi-tenido-de-rojo-se-esperan-los-resultados-del-analisis-y-se-repiten-las-quejas-de-nid07022025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">La Nación</a> described it as a “nauseating smell, like garbage.”</p><p>“It looked like a river covered in blood,” Ms. Ducomls said.</p><p>She said that the stream had turned other strange colors over the years — bluish, greenish, purplish, pink — and that it sometimes had an oily sheen. “It’s terrible,” she said, blaming pollution for the changing colors.</p><p>Moira Zellner, a professor of public policy and urban affairs at Northeastern University, who grew up in Buenos Aires and worked as an environmental consultant on river and land remediation projects there in the 1990s, blamed “chronic lack of regulation and lack of enforcement” for the region’s pollution problems.</p><p>“Unfortunately, I’m not too surprised,” she said of the red color of the stream in Sarandí. “There’s a huge, long history of pollution in the rivers of Buenos Aires, and it’s really heartbreaking. I know some of the populations that have settled there are really suffering from the consequences.”</p><p>Carlos Colángelo, the president of the Professional Council of Chemistry for the Province of Buenos Aires, told a local news outlet, <a href="https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/2025/02/06/un-arroyo-se-tino-de-rojo-en-avellaneda-y-los-vecinos-denuncian-constantes-derrames-toxicos/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">infobae.com</a>, that he was concerned that chemicals could have been dumped into the stream.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“We have to wait for the results of the analysis, but we can say that a company that would have dumped this is totally unscrupulous,” he said. “I don’t think they are chemical professionals because under no circumstances would they have allowed this waste to be dumped into the water.”</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
