Alito Jr., the justices upheld an F.D.A. order that prohibited retailers from marketing flavored tobacco products. The court rejected claims that the agency had unfairly switched its requirements during the application process.</p><p>Justice Alito wrote that the agency’s denials of the applications were “sufficiently consistent” with agency guidance on tobacco regulations. The justices rejected a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that the agency had acted arbitrarily and capriciously, finding that the F.D.A. had not tried to change the rules in the middle of the approval process.</p><p>A 2009 law, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, requires makers of new tobacco products to obtain authorization from the F.D.A. According to the law, the manufacturers’ applications must demonstrate that their products are “appropriate for the protection of the public health.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The agency has denied many applications under the law, including the two at issue in the case before the justices, saying the flavored liquids presented a “known and substantial risk to youth.”</p><p>The appeals court <a href="https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/21/21-60766-CV3.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ruled last year</a> that the agency had changed the rules in the middle of the application process, accusing it of “regulatory switcheroos” that sent the companies “on a wild-goose chase.” More formally, the court said the agency’s actions had been arbitrary and capricious.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1038/303408/20240319144123357_FDA%20v.%20Wages%20%20White%20Lion.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asking the Supreme Court</a> to hear the case, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/23-1038.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Food and Drug Administration v. Wages and White Lion Investments</a>, No. 23-1038, the agency’s lawyers cited <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca4/21-2077/21-2077-2022-12-12.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">another appeals court</a> that had reached the opposite conclusion. The Fifth Circuit’s decision “has far-reaching consequences for public health and threatens to undermine the Tobacco Control Act’s central objective of ‘ensuring that another generation of Americans does not become addicted to nicotine and tobacco products,’” they wrote, quoting from the other appeals court’s decision.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Liptak covers the Supreme Court and writes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/sidebar">Sidebar,</a> a column on legal developments.
