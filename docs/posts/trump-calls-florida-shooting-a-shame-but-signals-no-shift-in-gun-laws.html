    <h1>Trump Calls Florida Shooting a ‘Shame,’ but Signals No Shift in Gun Laws</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Trump said that he was very familiar with the school and the area. The university is about 400 miles from Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s residence in Palm Beach.</p><p>On Thursday, a 20-year-old student at the school shot and killed two people and injured six others, the police said. The gunman, Phoenix Ikner, is the son of a deputy in the local sheriff’s department, and was taken into custody after being shot by the police, officials said.</p><p>While the shooting may not have changed Mr. Trump’s position on gun laws, his administration was already expected <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/politics/trump-gun-control-measures.html" title="">to roll back an array of gun control measures</a>. The Justice Department also plans to create a path for people with criminal convictions <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/politics/trump-gun-rights-convicts.html" title="">to own guns again</a>, and has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/doj-la-sheriff-concealed-carry-permits-second-amendment.html" title="">threatened investigations</a> of states it perceives to be violating Second Amendment rights.</p><p>Since Mr. Trump took office, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is tasked with stemming the spread of illegal guns, has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/trump-atf.html" title="">weakened by staff departures</a> and by the diversion of agents from core duties to immigration enforcement.</p></div></div>
