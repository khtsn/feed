He was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/nyregion/outspoken-nypd-chief-is-tapped-for-top-uniformed-position.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">replaced</a> on Sunday by John Chell, the former chief of patrol.</p><p>Agents also searched other locations, Commissioner Tisch said, though she did not identify them. She referred questions to the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Maddrey owns a home in Jamaica, Queens, according to city property records. Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the Southern District, declined to comment on whether federal agents searched that house or any other properties.</p><p>Federal investigators have joined an inquiry by the city’s Department of Investigation into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/22/nyregion/new-york-police-department-maddrey.html" title="">the provision of overtime</a> and the allegations of sexual misconduct against Mr. Maddrey, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Mr. Biase declined to comment on the nature of the probe and the search warrants.</p><p>Commissioner Tisch has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/nyregion/jessica-tisch-nypd-appointments.html" title="">transferred hundreds of officers</a> since she was selected to lead the Police Department in November in a shake-up that has rocked an agency mired in scandal.</p><p>Among the transfers were top officials, including Tarik Sheppard, the combative head of communications who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/nyregion/nypd-reporters-adams.html" title="">clashed</a> with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/26/nyregion/police-reporters-trailer-nypd-eric-adams.html" title="">reporters</a> and been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/nyregion/nypd-nyc-marathon.html" title="">criticized for his public spat</a> with the former interim police commissioner, Thomas Donlon. Commissioner Tisch also appointed Chief Edward A. Thompson to lead the Internal Affairs Bureau, replacing Miguel Iglesias, who she said had been <a href="https://x.com/NYPDPC/status/1870637582754738633" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“relieved of his command.”</a></p><p>The restructuring follows months of turmoil for Mayor Eric Adams, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-indicted-news" title="">faces federal charges</a> for bribery and fraud. Edward A. Caban, a former police commissioner, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/nyregion/edward-caban-resigns-nypd-commissioner.html" title="">forced to resign</a> after federal officials seized his phone as part of a criminal investigation. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html" title="">wave of City Hall resignations</a> and local, state and federal investigations followed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Maddrey’s downfall was the latest blow to the Adams administration. The lieutenant, Quathisha Epps, last month filed a complaint against Mr. Maddrey with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that was described in <a href="https://www.thesandersfirmpc.com/quid-pro-quo-allegations-shake-nypd-leadership-under-maddrey" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a blog post</a> by her lawyer, Eric Sanders.</p><p>He wrote that Mr. Maddrey had taken advantage of her financial problems and vulnerable emotional state to force her into “unwanted sexual acts in exchange for professional benefits, including overtime opportunities.”</p><p>The Manhattan district attorney’s office is also conducting an investigation into the matter.</p><p>“These are extremely serious and disturbing claims that allegedly occurred at N.Y.P.D. headquarters in Manhattan,” said Danielle Filson, an office spokeswoman, after the allegations surfaced.</p><p>Mr. Maddrey has denied the accusations.</p><p>Last week, the former police chief stood silently next to his lawyer, Lambros Lambrou, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/27/nyregion/nypd-jeffrey-maddrey.html" title="">as Mr. Lambrou addressed reporters about the accusations</a>. Mr. Lambrou said that Mr. Maddrey had been accused by a subordinate who had engaged in overtime abuse and been investigated. Mr. Lambrou said that she had decided to blame Mr. Maddrey to “deflect her wrongdoing.”</p><p>Mr. Lambrou called the allegations against his client a lie. He did not immediately respond to a message for comment on Thursday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Adams, a former police captain, this week addressed the accusations against Mr. Maddrey. In an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1KakrxZ28G/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> on Monday on a YouTube channel, Corey’s Corner, Mr. Adams defended Mr. Maddrey’s police record and downplayed the tumult at the department, using a vulgarity for emphasis.</p><p>There have “always been scandals,” Mr. Adams said in the interview with Corey Pegues, a retired New York City police inspector. Mr. Adams also blamed the response to the department’s troubles on race, saying a “scandal under the Black mayor” should not be considered “unique.”</p><p>When asked whether he had overlooked problems involving Mr. Maddrey, including when Mr. Maddrey voided the arrest of a retired officer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/21/nyregion/nypd-jeffrey-maddrey-keechant-sewell.html" title="">accused of waving a gun at three boys</a>, Mr. Adams said: <strong>“</strong>I’m a firm believer that the worst day of your life should not define your life.”</p><p>Jeffery C.
