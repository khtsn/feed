Trump are staking their chances on two radically different theories of how to win: one tried-and-true, the other untested in modern presidential campaigns.</p><p>Ms. Harris’s team is running an expansive version of the type of field operation that has dominated politics for decades, deploying flotillas of paid staff members to organize and turn out every vote they can find. Mr. Trump’s campaign<strong> </strong>is going after a smaller universe of less frequent voters while relying on well-funded but inexperienced outside groups to reach a broader swath.</p><p>Interviews with more than four dozen voters, activists, campaign aides and officials in four pivotal counties — Erie County, Pa., Kenosha County, Wis., Maricopa County, Ariz., and Cobb County, Ga. — reveal a diffuse, at times unwieldy Republican effort that has raised questions from party operatives about effectiveness in the face of the more tightly structured Harris campaign operation. Democrats, in many places, are outpacing Republicans in terms of paid staff and doors knocked, and are counting on that local presence to break through a fractured media environment and to reach voters who want to tune out politics altogether.</p><p>“The national discourse kind of falls on deaf ears if it doesn’t feel real and localized,” said Dan Kanninen, the Harris campaign’s battleground states director. “Ultimately you’re trying to have a cohesive conversation with a voter across many modes to connect the dots.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>All told, the number of voters deciding the 2024 election could most likely fit in, and perhaps not even fill, a college football stadium. Across the seven battleground states, where the contests are in a dead heat, every ballot counts.</p><p>With 2,500 staff members located in 353 offices, the Harris campaign is working to convert the strongest backers into volunteers and to ensure that sporadic but supportive voters cast a ballot, all while winning over independents and moderate Republicans. Last week, the campaign said, it knocked on over 600,000 doors and made over three million calls through 63,000 volunteer shifts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/13/multimedia/00pol-groundgame-unitehere-bvzl/00pol-groundgame-unitehere-bvzl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/13/multimedia/00pol-groundgame-unitehere-bvzl/00pol-groundgame-unitehere-bvzl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/13/multimedia/00pol-groundgame-unitehere-bvzl/00pol-groundgame-unitehere-bvzl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A political volunteer on the sidewalk between two houses under a blue sky on a sunny day." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/13/multimedia/00pol-groundgame-unitehere-bvzl/00pol-groundgame-unitehere-bvzl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/13/multimedia/00pol-groundgame-unitehere-bvzl/00pol-groundgame-unitehere-bvzl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/13/multimedia/00pol-groundgame-unitehere-bvzl/00pol-groundgame-unitehere-bvzl-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/13/multimedia/00pol-groundgame-unitehere-bvzl/00pol-groundgame-unitehere-bvzl-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Iris Acosta, a canvasser for Unite Here, a union aligned with the Democratic Party, knocking on doors in Phoenix this month.

His campaign is focusing on a smaller number of infrequent voters who his team believes will back Mr. Trump if energized to vote. The campaign says it has “hundreds of paid staff” and over 300 offices across the battleground states. A top Republican strategist who spoke to campaign leaders, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the operations, said the campaign was training 40,000 volunteers, called “Trump Force 47 captains,” who were each charged with mobilizing 25 of these less likely voters — for a total reach of 1 million voters.</p><p>“What is very impactful is personal contacts with voters who don’t reliably vote in every election that are more disconnected from the political process,” said James Blair, the Trump campaign’s political director. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Outside organizations and super PACs funded by conservative donors are picking up efforts to reach even more voters. Prominent among them are Turning Point Action, an organization of young conservatives led by Charlie Kirk, a Trump ally, and America PAC, a super PAC <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/us/politics/elon-musk-donald-trump-pennsylvania.html" title="">affiliated with Elon Musk</a> — both of which have little experience running field programs — as well as the Faith and Freedom Coalition, a more veteran Christian organization that is focused on engaging conservative evangelical voters.</p><p>A door-to-door strategy that so heavily relies on third-party efforts has never been seen before in a presidential campaign. Mr. Trump’s team is taking advantage of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/us/politics/fec-deadlock-deregulation.html" title="">a Federal Election Commission decision earlier this year</a> that for the first time allows the campaigns and these types of organizations to coordinate on canvassing operations.</p><p>It’s also a financial necessity: Mr. Trump has raised far less in campaign cash than Ms. Harris. Mr. Musk’s group alone is seeded with tens of millions of dollars of the billionaire’s own funds.</p><p>Both sides agree that a bigger ground game doesn’t ensure victory. In 2016, Hillary Clinton’s campaign boasted about its operation, while Mr. Trump had <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/rob-portman-may-provide-reverse-coattails-for-donald-trump-in-ohio-1475181035" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">almost no field staff in the key states</a>. Four years later, the second Trump campaign bragged about knocking on one million doors weekly, while the Biden campaign conducted no in-person canvassing out of concern about the Covid pandemic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Here’s a closer look at counties that could decide the election:</p><h2 id="link-a6ffe2">In Erie County, Pa., a disjointed Republican operation is plagued by infighting.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Brian Shank, a superfan of former President Donald J.

The infighting, according to interviews with multiple people involved, is a byproduct of the Trump campaign’s decision to largely leave its ground game not only to local Republican Party offices but also to a variety of outside groups, all with their own methodologies and demands for attention.</p><p>Tom Eddy, the Erie County Republican Party chairman, appears to be at war with a core group of Republican activists who have styled themselves as the mainstay of the party’s ground game in the county. Mr. Eddy calls those activists self-promoters and cranks.</p><p>The activists, led by a Trump superfan, Brian Shank, call Mr. Eddy mean and stodgy.</p><p>“I don’t know if it hurts,” said Harrison Dunn, a young Republican activist in Erie County who founded his own super PAC allied with Mr. Shank to promote Republicans in the region. “It doesn’t help, which is its own kind of hurt.”</p><p>At times, the groups are right on top of each other. Outside a Trump rally in Erie, a tent pitched by one group abutted the tent of another — and both were shouting at passers-by to register to vote or sign up for mail-in ballots.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Outside a Trump rally in Erie last month, Turning Point Action and Trump Force 47’s voter registration tents were abutting each other.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Swensen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The day before, Mr. Shank, a former member of the county council who was ousted by a Democrat last November, and Kimberly Hunter, a co-founder of Mr. Dunn’s super PAC, Restore America, stood for hours at Dobbins Landing, a popular spot on Erie’s waterfront,<span>  </span>with about a dozen Trump-flag-waving compatriots from the 814 Patriots Group, another organization of the former president’s supporters. Mr. Shank’s trailer featured a rickety mannequin of Mr. Trump in a disheveled suit and tie, dark glasses and a red MAGA hat that nonetheless attracted passers-by eager to climb a small aluminum ladder to pose for pictures.</p><p>As they did, Ms. Hunter asked whether they were registered to vote and pressed them to take applications for mail-in ballots. Mr. Dunn, meanwhile, bragged about pushing the county to clean up its voter rolls after the 2020 election, resulting in a purge of 13,499 Democrats. </p><p>“The Republican Party’s not doing anything,” Mr. Shank said. “We are.”</p><p>At Erie County Republican headquarters in Millcreek Township, outside the city of Erie, Mr. Eddy was openly dismissive of those efforts. Three staff members hired by the Trump campaign under the “Trump Force 47” banner were the real muscle behind the Republican ground game in the county, he said. Yard signs were piled high. His office had people fanning out through various neighborhoods to drop off Republican literature, though he conceded that canvassers were leery of knocking on potentially hostile doors.</p><p>Everyone involved noted the Republican efforts were outgunned by those of the Democrats, however.</p><p>“The Democrats have 11 paid people in the county,” Mr. Eddy marveled. “We have three and some volunteers.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>On a recent Saturday morning, out of the county Democratic headquarters in downtown Erie, two successive waves of canvassers went out to persuade the undecided. About 120 canvassers, bolstered by union members from as far away as Buffalo, N.Y., checked in for the first wave. Another 60 to 70 came two hours later.</p><p>“It’s a little scary and intimidating to knock on doors, but really, it’s been good,” said Conrad Kubaney, 33, who along with his wife, Susie Guisto, 27, has gotten involved in a presidential campaign for the first time, knocking doors for Ms. Harris. “There’s a sense that we’re not taking anything for granted.”</p><h2 id="link-6572a7a8">Volunteers in Kenosha County, Wis., test the Trump strategy.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Volunteers gathered at the headquarters of the Kenosha County Republican Party in Kenosha, Wis., last month.

Democrats in Georgia are targeting as many people as possible, from staunch liberals in the heart of Atlanta to independents and even moderate Republicans in the city’s suburbs and exurbs. The campaign boasts 26 offices statewide, complete with 200 paid staff members.</p><p>The razor-thin margins that could decide the election were laid bare at the doors, however.</p><p>Standing on her front porch, Agnes McGhee, 75, said that she planned to support Ms. Harris this November.
