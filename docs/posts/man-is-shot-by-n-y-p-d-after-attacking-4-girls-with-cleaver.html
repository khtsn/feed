The police had never received a report of domestic violence at the home, John Chell, the chief of department, said. But Commissioner Tisch said that, according to family members, Mr. Chen had a history of mental illness.</p><p>The 911 call came in around 10:15 a.m., Commissioner Tisch said. The 11-year-old said on the phone that Mr. Chen had stabbed her and her siblings in their home on 84th Street near 17th Avenue.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“This could have ended very differently,” said Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>When officers and emergency medical workers arrived, a boy, who was not injured and who had run to a neighbor’s house to ask for help, opened the outside door and led them into a vestibule. The officers could hear the children screaming behind an apartment door, the commissioner said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The officers forced open the door, which was locked, and saw Mr. Chen holding the meat cleaver, covered in blood, Commissioner Tisch said. There was blood on the walls and the floor, she said.</p><p>The officers ordered Mr. Chen several times to drop the weapon, but he refused and moved toward the officers, she said.</p><p>Two officers, who fired seven total rounds, shot him, Commissioner Tisch said.</p><p>The cleaver was recovered along with a bloody knife found in another room, she said.</p><p>Humberto Huerta, 23, who lives in the neighborhood, said he heard the police sirens from several blocks away. He followed the sounds to the house, where he saw emergency medical workers wheel a man out on a stretcher. Mr. Huerta said the man was shirtless and lying on his side, his wrists cuffed behind his back.</p><p>Susan Zhuang, a City Council member who represents a neighboring district and speaks Mandarin, also went to the house. She said the stabbings had rocked the close-knit Asian American community in south Brooklyn, which she said has little access to mental health support. Most of the residents, Ms. Zhuang said, do not speak English.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“It’s very hard, and they don’t know how to get the resources,” she said.</p><p>Neighbors, who described the area as being safe, family-oriented and diverse, said it was surreal that violence of this kind had happened there.</p><p>“It’s shocking,” said Suk Ma, a woman in her 50s who lives nearby and whose children live next door. “I’ve been here 30 years, and nothing like this ever happened.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
