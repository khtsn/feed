    <h1>Putin, in Threat to West, Says Russia Struck Ukraine With New Missile</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President Vladimir V. Putin escalated a tense showdown with the West on Thursday, saying that Russia had launched a new intermediate-range ballistic missile at Ukraine in response to Ukraine’s recent use of American and British weapons to strike deeper into Russia.</p><p>Mr. Putin called the strike a “test” of a new missile called the Oreshnik and said that its was successful, hitting a military-industrial complex. Ukraine said that a volley of missiles, including the intermediate missile, targeted the eastern city of Dnipro on Thursday, the latest assault in a week of rising hostilities between the two adversaries.</p><p>In what appeared to be an ominous threat against Ukraine’s western allies, Mr. Putin said: “We consider ourselves entitled to use our weapons against the military facilities of those countries that allow their weapons to be used against our facilities.”</p><p>Mr. Putin made his comments in a rare address to the nation. His tone was both boastful and threatening, saying he was sending his message to “the Russian Armed Forces, the citizens of our country, our friends around the world, as well as those who continue to harbor illusions about the possibility of inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia.”</p></div></div>
