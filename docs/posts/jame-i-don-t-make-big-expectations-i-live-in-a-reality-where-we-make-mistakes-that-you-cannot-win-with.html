                  <p>Normality has been somewhat resumed at PGL Cluj-Napoca, however, as <a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/13776/jame" data-tooltip-id="uid1273860671">Dzhami <span>&#34;⁠Jame⁠&#34;</span> Ali</a>&#39;s troops fought through the Swiss system with a 3-2 record to secure a well-deserved spot in the BTarena.</p>
                  <p>After the match, <a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/13776/jame" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1273860671">Jame</a> spoke to HLTV about the qualification clash against <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid1576996815">FUT</a>, the expectations for the rest of the tournament in Cluj, and the fact that the team has already chosen its number-one goal of the season — the IEM Cologne Major.</p>

                  <p><strong>FUT is a team that you know at least from your online matches against them. Did you approach this matchup any differently compared to others, considering that in tier-one you don&#39;t typically play teams you usually play online?</strong></p>
                  <p>We and they are growing quickly, developing as a team and as players. What was online is a different world, a different Counter-Strike. So I saw a difference in them becoming more solid players, less random, and more team-oriented, while keeping their incredible individual game. We prepared and even evaluated them as a more dangerous opponent for us, because these young guys can, in one day, just pop off and perform like older players perform once a year.</p>
                  <p><strong>This time it was very close. Toward the end it felt like pressure might have affected them, that 1v2 from BELCHONOKK being one of those examples. Do you think that was what decided the match today?</strong></p>
                  <p>I think there are many moments people don&#39;t see from the outside that influence matches and the condition [of the team]. If we played a more experienced, more solid Counter-Strike, I think it would be easier for us. Some mistakes knock you out of rhythm, and trust disappears. But I think the ending was obviously [decided by] BELCHONOKK, because he had made many important suggestions and ideas that he executed well.</p>
                  <p><strong>Your and FUT&#39;s playstyles are very different; it&#39;s a big clash of play styles, really. One being very slow and measured, the other being quite dynamic and aggressive Counter-Strike. How did you approach this matchup from a preparation perspective?</strong></p>
                  <p>I think regarding structure, we are plus-minus on the same level. Structure, as I understand it, is when players know everything that is being done and the model in their zones. In that sense we are similar. But in terms of dynamics, yes, as you said, they are more aggressive and can allow themselves aggressive actions much more often than we can.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>FaZe and G2 are very strong opponents, and the fact that my team can win is very important in the long run</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p>In CS2, everything still comes down to the first duels. We just tried to play what is comfortable for us. It&#39;s hard for me to say they were playing extremely aggressive, in some moments, they just stood and killed us. But I can&#39;t highlight some huge difference from other teams. Right now, nobody just stands still, everyone plays dynamic Counter-Strike. In some moments of their T sides, maybe they have more confidence thanks to their firepower and can take duels that other players cannot allow themselves.</p>
                  <p><strong>After the Bounty win, you remained quite realistic, saying it was just one tournament. How did you set expectations in Cluj after the early exit in Krakow?</strong></p>
                  <p>If I&#39;m being honest, I don&#39;t make big expectations, because I live in a reality where we make mistakes that you cannot win with. When we were in VP, we could make one or two critical mistakes and lose a game. Now we make ten times more, but because of individual play we sometimes close it out. So it&#39;s quite hard to... observe some kind of perspective and build expectations.</p>
                  <p>I was just happy for every match we won. For me, FaZe and G2 are very strong opponents, and the fact that my team can win is very important in the long run. We are still at the development stage, and not all maps, not all roles, not all elements are [ready]. We have a lot of work. It&#39;s one year of professional play, [and we&#39;re going up] against players who have been playing for decades.</p>

                    <p>Jame&#39;s two aggressive stars have yet to find consistency</p>
                  </div>
                  <p><strong>You&#39;ve shown at this tournament already that you can still match up to some of the best teams in matches against MOUZ and FURIA. Do you think you can replicate the Bounty result and go far?</strong></p>
                  <p>I think now it&#39;s much harder to do that. Because we play a lot of tournaments, and somewhere some of the development gets lost. Plus, teams are already ready for us, and it&#39;s much easier for our opponents to adjust their game to us than for us to do it. We will make a lot of mistakes.</p>
                  <p>But overall, I see every tournament and every game as big experience and one step on the way toward the big goals for our team. We are going toward the Major, we want to perform decently there. For us, this tournament is more like good mentality training. We test ourselves in stressful situations. So we are not thinking about titles at all. As I said before, we live in reality.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>two young guys have to agree between themselves on how to win over YEKINDAR, FalleN, NiKo, and so on</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p><strong>Lastly, I wanted to ask about your unusual system, which features two aggressive stars in front of an AWPing IGL. nota and xiELO haven&#39;t quite found their stability, though, taking turns between who&#39;s on for any given match. How can you find more consistency out of your two stars?</strong></p>
                  <p>When we talk about sniper captains, it&#39;s a very good and fundamental question. Ideally, we just shouldn&#39;t have a captain who plays poorly individually. If I can, without some hard performance, just play average thanks to an AWP, then we as a team should be more stable on the map.</p>
                  <p>But to get there, there must be two experienced star players who are individually strong and understand macro. And that&#39;s where the problem is. Because when the captain plays one of those roles, it&#39;s much easier: he takes everything into his own hands, and the other main player doesn&#39;t need to do much. Everything is in the hands of one person.</p>
                  <p>When we talk about our team, two young guys have to agree between themselves on how to win over YEKINDAR, FalleN, NiKo, and so on, which raises the question of how they can do it. There is some [lag] between their thoughts and how those thoughts are perceived. In reality, it&#39;s all very complicated. We got into this situation, I don&#39;t know how... I don&#39;t know how to get out of it either. We just hope for the best, that the guys will develop and at least quickly understand the ideas that are being communicated and execute them well.</p>
