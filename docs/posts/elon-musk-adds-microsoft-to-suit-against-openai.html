Mr. Hoffman is a Microsoft board member and previously served on the board of OpenAI.</p><p>The new legal filing also adds two plaintiffs to the suit alongside Mr. Musk: his start-up xAI, which competes with OpenAI, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/technology/openai-altman-board-fight.html" title="">Shivon Zilis</a>, a former OpenAI board member. Ms. Zilis is now an executive at Mr. Musk’s brain implant company Neuralink and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/business/elon-musk-children-compound.html" title="">mother</a> of three of his children.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>OpenAI and Mr. Hoffman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Microsoft declined to comment.</p><p>Mr. Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/01/technology/elon-musk-openai-sam-altman-lawsuit.html" title="">sued OpenAI</a> in March in a state court in San Francisco, before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/11/technology/elon-musk-openai-lawsuit.html" title="">withdrawing</a> the suit without explanation. Seven weeks later, he filed a new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/elon-musk-openai-lawsuit.html" title="">suit in federal court</a>, arguing that OpenAI violated federal racketeering laws by conspiring to defraud him.</p><p>Like the original suit, the federal complaint claimed that OpenAI and two of its founders, Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, breached the company’s founding contract by putting commercial interests ahead of the public good.</p><p>After joining with Mr. Musk to create OpenAI in 2015 and pledging to carefully develop artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity, the suit claimed, Mr. Altman and Mr. Brockman abandoned this mission by entering its multibillion-dollar partnership with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/technology/microsoft-openai-partnership-deal.html" title="">Microsoft</a>.</p><p>Mr. Musk stepped away from OpenAI in 2018, before that partnership was created.</p><p>In the amended complaint, Mr. Musk argued that OpenAI is trying to eliminate competitors like xAI by insisting that its investors refrain from funding these rivals. He also argued that xAI had been harmed because OpenAI’s partnership with Microsoft allowed the two companies to trade “competitively sensitive information.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Both Mr. Hoffman and Dee Templeton, a Microsoft vice president, had undermined antitrust laws because they were both involved with the boards of Microsoft and OpenAI, according to the complaint.</p><p>“The purpose of the prohibition on interlocking directorates is to prevent sharing of competitively sensitive information,” the complaint read.</p><p>In adding Ms. Zilis as a plaintiff in the suit, the new filing said that she repeatedly raised concerns over OpenAI’s dealings while serving as a board member. She left the OpenAI board last year.</p><p>(The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" title="">sued</a> OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Cade Metz writes about artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality and other emerging areas of technology.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/cade-metz">More about Cade Metz</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
