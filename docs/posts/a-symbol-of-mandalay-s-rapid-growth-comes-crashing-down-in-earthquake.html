Until last week, it stood as a symbol of this city’s rapid urbanization despite a four-year civil war.</p><p>When the earthquake ravaged Myanmar, five stories of the condominium slid underground. On Tuesday, the air reeked of decaying corpses, the stench made worse by the 100-degree heat, as desperate family members circled the ruins of the building looking for loved ones.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Please speed up!” shouted Sai Myo Tun, who was searching for his sister, to volunteers in yellow hard hats and Chinese rescue workers scrambling to untangle the mound of concrete, debris, and steel. “My sister can still be alive if you speed up.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of a Chinese search-and-rescue team transferring a pregnant survivor from a collapsed building in Mandalay, on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Myo Kyaw Soe/Xinhua, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Sai Myo Tun said his sister, who is three months pregnant, and her husband were trapped under the building. He said his sister had bought an apartment in Sky Villa last year. It is not known how many other people may be under the ruins.</p><p>“The rescue teams say there may not be any survivors left,” he said. “But I’m still holding on to hope.”</p><p>In recent years, Mandalay has been the site of a building boom, its fancy nightclubs and rising apartment blocks a sign of increased social mobility. A center of Buddhist culture and the last royal capital before the kingdom was annexed by the British Empire in 1885, it is a sprawling city of about 1.5 million and home to multiple religions and ethnicities. That includes many Chinese who arrived in the 20th century.</p><p>Since the army seized power in a coup four years ago, it has also emerged as an epicenter of resistance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Today, it is a city destroyed. On Tuesday, a gold mine collapsed in Mandalay’s Singu township, killing 27, according to Myanmar Rescue Let Pan Hla, a local group. For days, volunteers have been combing through the rubble of collapsed buildings with their bare hands. Heavy machinery finally arrived on Saturday with a rescue team from China.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“The smell of decomposing bodies is getting stronger, so I don’t think there will be any survivors,” said Kyaw Gyi, a volunteer helping with rescue efforts at Sky Villa. He said on Tuesday morning that a cat made it out alive, but no human survivors had been found. “I estimate that at least 100 people are still inside.”</p><p>Bananas had been placed on a table near the ruins of the condominium, as prayer offerings.</p><p>Daw Thet Tin, who said her daughter and granddaughter are trapped under the building, has kept vigil at a nearby monastery.</p><p>“Lin Lin, dear, Mama is right here!” she shouted in the direction of the building. “The rescue teams are working to save you, stay strong!”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Thet Tin said she had not left the monastery since the day of the earthquake. “Every day, I pray to Buddha for them,” she said.</p><p>The destruction in Mandalay has been widespread. <a href="https://mssmt.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=a7b29b14077940b3aea01aef5bf29968" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">An analysis of Mandalay</a> by Microsoft’s AI for Good Lab showed 515 buildings were 80 percent to 100 percent damaged, and another 1,524 were 20 percent to 80 percent damaged. It was not clear what percentage of the city’s buildings those numbers represented.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Residents taking shelter in a makeshift tent camp in Mandalay on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sai Aung Main/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Rural parts of Mandalay have been ignored for days as rescue teams focus on the downtown areas. Some of these are impoverished areas where Muslims, a minority in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar, are concentrated, aid groups say.</p><p>“They’re not receiving any support or aid, even though there’s been a lot of deaths there as well,” said Melody Crisp of Thr5ve, a nonprofit helping displaced communities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Ms. Crisp said that in parts of Mandalay, the authorities were telling people to return home by 10 p.m. and threatening forced military service if they didn’t comply, citing her contacts in the city. </p><p>Families are sleeping on sidewalks in the city, swarmed by mosquitoes at night. There are fears that clean water and food could soon run out.</p><p>Haider Yaqub, the Myanmar country director for Plan International, a child rights organization, has been interviewing residents to assess what their needs are. He said they desperately need shelter and fuel<span>  </span>to help with rescue efforts.</p><p>Many of the collapsed structures were some of the country’s historic and religious sites such as mosques, pagodas and monasteries.

The daily aftershocks have scared them, and in recent days, many left town.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sui-Lee Wee is the Southeast Asia bureau chief for The Times, overseeing coverage of 11 countries in the region.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
