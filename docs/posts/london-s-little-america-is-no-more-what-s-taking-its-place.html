They left behind the eagle, along with a collection of monuments and memorials in the adjoining Grosvenor Square — relics of what was once an American citadel in its ancestral land.</p><p>John Adams lived on the square. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower had his wartime office there. A statue of Franklin D. Roosevelt gazes across the patchy lawn. Diplomats threw star-spangled election night parties, while hopeful travelers lined up outside for visas. During the Vietnam War, protesters <a href="https://www.martinparrfoundation.org/davidhurn/grosvenor-square-riots-1968/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">clashed with police</a> under the trees.</p><p>Now, Grosvenor Square is being recast for a post-American age. The Chancery plans to open to guests in early September, its Persian Gulf owners having converted the Brutalist landmark, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1960/10/29/archives/architect-defends-design-of-embassy.html" title="">designed by Eero Saarinen</a>, into a Rosewood luxury hotel, with junior suites starting at 1,400 pounds (nearly $1,900) a night.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The square, which lies in front of the hotel and has a different owner, is closing this week for a 13-month refurbishment. The project will add lush plantings that celebrate biodiversity and link the six-acre expanse, which has fallen into a state of neglect, more closely to its 18th-century Georgian roots. The owner, Grosvenor Property, insists it is preserving the legacy of a place once known as “Little America.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/07/multimedia/07int-uk-grosvenor-02-qcjh/07int-uk-grosvenor-02-qcjh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/07/multimedia/07int-uk-grosvenor-02-qcjh/07int-uk-grosvenor-02-qcjh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/07/multimedia/07int-uk-grosvenor-02-qcjh/07int-uk-grosvenor-02-qcjh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="People walking in a tree-lined grassy square in London." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/07/multimedia/07int-uk-grosvenor-02-qcjh/07int-uk-grosvenor-02-qcjh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/07/multimedia/07int-uk-grosvenor-02-qcjh/07int-uk-grosvenor-02-qcjh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/07/multimedia/07int-uk-grosvenor-02-qcjh/07int-uk-grosvenor-02-qcjh-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/07/multimedia/07int-uk-grosvenor-02-qcjh/07int-uk-grosvenor-02-qcjh-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/95504c37-ab0c-5a4e-a991-57e7e8fe4ec2" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Grosvenor Square in front of the former U.S. Embassy, a Brutalist landmark building that has been turned into a luxury hotel by its Persian Gulf owners, with junior suites starting at 1,400 pounds (nearly $1,900) a night.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Testa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But Grosvenor Square attests to how much the world has changed, not least since President Trump returned to the White House. Start with the fact that the embassy was bought by investors from Qatar, whose government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/us/politics/trump-air-force-one-qatar-jet.html" title="">recently gave</a> the Trump administration a Boeing 747 as a replacement for Air Force One.</p><p>“If you’re trying to attract people, if you’re trying make money, highlighting America’s prominence is not the way to do it,” said Leslie Vinjamuri, the director of the U.S. and Americas program at Chatham House, a research group in London. “It’s a good time to take a step back, to play it down a bit.”</p><p>Ties between Britain and the United States ebb and flow, she noted, in a “special relationship” that is neither as serene nor as harried as often portrayed. A new global crisis could swiftly bring these old allies back together. But Mr. Trump’s acrimonious dealings with Europe have indisputably changed the mood.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“There is just a sense of pulling apart between the U.K. and the U.S.,” said Ms. Vinjamuri, who will leave London this month to become the chief executive of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.</p><p>Mr. Trump, who has a soft spot for the royal family and other totems of imperial Britain, complained bitterly about the sale of the embassy. He blamed it, wrongly, on his predecessor President Barack Obama. (The decision was made during the George W. Bush administration because of security concerns.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Construction workers at the former embassy.

The new location, in a redeveloped industrial section of London known as Nine Elms, was “lousy,” he said, spurning an invitation to a ribbon cutting.</p><p>Indeed, since the days of Charles Dickens and Oscar Wilde, Grosvenor Square has been synonymous with posh London. The Grosvenor family laid it out in the 1720s to anchor the expansion of its property empire into West London. With grand dimensions and an elegant oval shape, it attracted wealthy residents, who were given keys to their own private Eden in the capital. (It became a public park after World War II.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>It also attracted Americans, starting with Adams, who lived on the northeast corner from 1785 to 1788 as America’s first envoy to Britain. After Eisenhower quartered himself there, it was nicknamed “Eisenhower Platz.” The Roosevelt statue was paid for with donations from ordinary Britons as a gesture of gratitude to the United States for its aid in the war.</p><p>Nothing sealed the American connection like the opening of Saarinen’s chancery in 1960, a hulking nine-story building that was the first purpose-built embassy of any country in London. In its early days, it was reviled by some critics as a jarring intrusion on the genteel Georgian symmetry of the square.</p><p>“It had this sense of America being big and bold, and in a British context, a sense of ‘Wow, how American,’” said Matthew Barzun, the last American ambassador to have an office in the building.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A statue of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the square.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Testa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Mr. Barzun, who witnessed ups and downs in the trans-Atlantic relationship over Syria and Brexit, said the old embassy was designed to be “light and open and welcoming.” But after the terrorist bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, “we added more and more fences and bollards,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“You start out building things to keep people out,” Mr. Barzun said, “but you end up trapping people in.”</p><p>Converting a diplomatic fortress into a sleek, five-star hotel was a design and engineering test for Qatari Diar, a real estate company backed by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund. The Qataris brought in Rosewood, a luxury hotel chain that was started in Dallas and is now owned by a Hong Kong conglomerate.</p><p>“Creating warmth was the biggest challenge,” said Michael Bonsor, the hotel’s managing director, as he offered a sneak peek. “You have this juxtaposition of one of the most secure, fortified buildings in London, where Marines used to run around with machine guns. It wasn’t the most hospitable building in the world.”</p><p>Dapper and discreet, Mr. Bonsor could have been a diplomat if he hadn’t gone into hospitality. He said the hotel would make nods to its past, but would avoid becoming a Cold War-style theme park. In addition to the eagle, which is a protected landmark, the hotel has reinstalled statues of Eisenhower and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/05/world/europe/05reagan.html" title="">Ronald Reagan</a> that once flanked the building (the statues are wrapped in tarp to protect them during construction).</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The prizewinning British architect David Chipperfield has reconfigured the building to add an atrium with cascading chandeliers.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Testa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Inside, the Chancery has retained some of Saarinen’s design elements, notably his exposed-concrete ceiling. But the prizewinning British architect David Chipperfield has reconfigured the building to add an atrium with cascading chandeliers. Two palatial penthouses are named after Elizabeth and Charles, monarchs not presidents. The hotel said their scale would appeal to guests from the Middle East.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Across the street, the proprietors of Grosvenor Square are similarly aware of the tug between past and present. While they will retain the F.D.R. statue, as well as a memorial to victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, they plan to add serpentine paths and extensive plantings to soften the square’s stark appearance.</p><p>“The austere design, which was important during the Cold War period, has had its day,” said Cordula Zeidler, a heritage and design expert who advised Grosvenor Property. “Having more plantings is both a Georgian concept and something people want today.”</p><p>James Raynor, the newly named chief executive of Grosvenor, acknowledged the complicated political backdrop to the project. But he said, “I don’t think we should be altering it for the long term on the basis of short-term noise.”</p><p>In turbulent times, Mr. Raynor even holds out hope that the 18th-century square can still serve as a 21st-century bridge. “Will the park by itself change the diplomatic relationship between the countries?” he said. “I doubt it. But it will allow us to recognize what the two countries have done for each other.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The gilded aluminum eagle, its wings spread wide, crowns the midcentury modern building that once housed the embassy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Testa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mark Landler is the London bureau chief of The Times, covering the United Kingdom, as well as American foreign policy in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
