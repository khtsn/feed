Trump routinely raises the issue of crime on the campaign trail, saying that it is “through the roof” and that cities like Philadelphia are “ravaged by bloodshed.”</p><p>Philadelphia, like many other American cities, endured a sharp spike in homicides during the pandemic. But now many of those same places are seeing a sharp drop, including in swing states. In Arizona, the decline in violent crime is even steeper than the national average.</p><p>But falling crime does not necessarily translate into voter comfort, said Paul Sracic, a political science professor at Youngstown State University in Ohio. </p><p>“When we talk about crime, in some ways it’s similar to how we talk about economics in that perception matters,” Dr. Sracic said, adding, “Perception is as important as reality — and maybe more important than reality to voters.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Republicans have tried to tie crime to immigration, with ad after ad connecting the wave of migrants at the border with fentanyl overdoses, murder and rape. (Research shows that <a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/undocumented-immigrant-offending-rate-lower-us-born-citizen-rate" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">immigrants commit crime at a much lower rate</a> than native-born Americans do.)</p><p>Democrats are talking more about crime as well, said Insha Rahman, the director of Vera Action, which works to reduce incarceration. While Republicans still spend more on campaign ads about crime, they no longer spend three or four times more, she said.</p><p>Some Democratic candidates have simply echoed Republicans’ tough-on-crime talking points, but others have focused on a different approach to public safety, including popular measures such as increasing mental health and drug treatment, like in <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/7f6a7fe9-9da2-4d21-a49e-d1179b8d8bf8/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this ad</a> by Kamala Harris’s campaign.</p><p>While very few voters say crime is their No. 1 issue, many say it is important. Republican voters tend to rank crime as a greater concern than Democrats do, and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/652763/smaller-majorities-say-crime-serious-increasing.aspx?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent Gallup poll</a> found that the partisan gap is the largest on record. Republican candidates generally have an advantage over Democrats when voters are asked who would better handle the issue. </p><p>However, right after the presidential debate in September, in which Ms. Harris emphasized her experience as a prosecutor, this perception gap narrowed to within <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-debate-winner-maintaining-slight-lead-trump-poll/story?id=113673862" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one point</a>, according to one national poll.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Here is how crime looks in battleground states, using data from AH Datalytics’ Real-Time Crime Index.

Overall violent crime is flat and overall property crime is down 7 percent this year over the same period last year.</p><p>Arizona has outpaced the national trend, with violent crime falling last year more than in the rest of the country.</p><p>This means that, for the most part, voter attention in Arizona is focused on other issues like education, immigration and abortion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In Arizona’s senate race, Kari Lake, the Republican candidate, has sought to tie the situation at the border to fentanyl and called her opponent, Ruben Gallego, a Democrat, soft on crime.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Law enforcement members posted along the border wall in Hereford, Ariz., in August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paul Ratje for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But Ms. Lake is still behind in the polls, and the Arizona Police Association recently endorsed Mr. Gallego.</p><p>Arizona voters will also decide on a ballot initiative that would allow the local police to arrest and deport migrants.</p><h3 id="link-4d54f649"><span><strong>Georgia</strong></span></h3><p>Violent crime peaked in October 2020, near the beginning of the pandemic, and this year, it has dropped below prepandemic levels.</p><p>Murders are down 3 percent this year over the same period last year.

Mr. Ibarra, a 26-year-old migrant from Venezuela, had been previously charged with entering the country illegally.

Car thefts are down 17 percent. Overall violent crime is down 5 percent and overall property crime is down 8 percent this year over the same period last year.</p><p>In August, Mr. Trump visited Livingston County, west of Detroit, to hold a news conference with the local sheriff.</p><p>“The people of Michigan and the rest of the country can’t take another four years of weak, soft-on-crime leadership,’’ the Trump campaign said in a statement. </p><p>Mr. Trump was trying to stoke an evergreen issue in Michigan, specifically in many of the suburbs of Detroit, where voters worry about crime spilling out of the city into their neighborhoods, said Ron Stevenson, a professor of communications at Wayne State University in Detroit.</p><p>That is largely an outdated view of the city, though. Over the last decade, the city’s downtown has been remade and neighborhoods have attracted new investments. Murders <a href="https://detroitmi.gov/opportunities/detroit-tackling-crime-across-city" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dropped last year</a> to the lowest level in decades. And in several Detroit suburbs, serious crime rates have been relatively stable over the past few years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Detroit, murders dropped last year to the lowest level in decades.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nic Antaya for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Still, certain crimes, like a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/eastern-market-shooter-acted-in-self-defense-prosecutor-says/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fatal shooting at a Detroit Lions tailgating event</a> in September, could reinforce the outdated view of the Motor City, Dr. Stevenson said. “Detroit has never really been able to shake its reputation as a crime-stricken city, especially in an election year,” he said.</p><h3 id="link-5c6624d"><span><strong>Nevada</strong></span></h3><p>Post-pandemic violent crime peaked in July 2020, but was still lower than when it spiked in May 2018 and May 2019.</p><p>Murders are down 11 percent this year over the same period last year.

This year, overall violent crime is down 8 percent and overall property crime is down 12 percent over the same period last year.</p><p>The economy has been the primary concern among voters in Nevada, according to polls.

These have both been priorities of Gov.

Car thefts are up 5 percent, over a steep increase in 2023. Overall violent crime is down 1 percent and overall property crime is down 2 percent this year over the same period last year.</p><p>Crime still motivates Republican voters in North Carolina, said Michael Bitzer, a professor of politics and history at Catawba College in Salisbury, N.C. “In this state, at least with such a polarized environment, one side is naturally going to latch onto issues that the other side is not even going to recognize,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>In the largely liberal Triangle area, crime has been intertwined with other quality-of-life issues, such as those that can accompany homelessness. A spike in car thefts and other crime in downtown Raleigh drew vocal complaints last year. The police said this summer that a renewed focus on the area had helped ease the problem.</p><h3 id="link-2ade07a6"><span><strong>Pennsylvania</strong></span></h3><p>Violent crime peaked in October 2020 and has been on a downward trajectory since then.</p><p>Murders are down 34 percent this year over the same period last year. Car thefts are down 39 percent. Overall violent crime and overall property crime are down 12 percent this year over the same period last year.</p><p>Crime did not appear to be a major driving force for votes in Pennsylvania, said Berwood Yost, the director of the Center for Opinion Research at Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa. But along with immigration and the economy, crime was being deployed symbolically by Republicans to bolster a narrative that the United States — particularly in big cities like Philadelphia — is falling apart under Democratic leadership. </p><p>In Philadelphia, violent crime rates remained high for longer than in the state overall, and property crime peaked much later, during the Biden administration. Though both are now trending downward, Philadelphia is not as far along in its recovery as the rest of the state.</p><p>Crime has played a role in the race for a U.S. Senate seat, in which Dave McCormick, a Republican businessman, is seeking to unseat the three-term Democratic incumbent, Bob Casey Jr. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>David McCormick, right, and Senator Bob Casey Jr. during a debate in October.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Matt Rourke/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Mr. McCormick’s ads have featured a sheriff blaming a lack of control at the border for the death of his son from a fentanyl overdose.</p><p>In late August, Senator Casey said that being tough on crime is not enough.

Tony Evers, a Democrat, was paroling too many inmates and had failed to promptly control the unrest in the city of Kenosha in 2020. Despite this criticism, Mr. Evers won re-election easily.</p><p>This year, many violent crimes are down in the state’s largest city, Milwaukee. But the city continues to struggle with carjackings. The issue is specific to Milwaukee, though, and largely doesn’t affect voters in the state’s mostly rural and suburban areas, said Barry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p><p>Source: AH Datalytics, with data from 20 cities in Arizona; three cities in Georgia; three cities in Michigan; five cities in Nevada; six cities in North Carolina; 18 cities in Pennsylvania; and one city in Wisconsin.</p><p>Benjamin Oreskes<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Shaila Dewan covers criminal justice — policing, courts and prisons — across the country.
