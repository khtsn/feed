The disaster heaped additional misery on a country where millions are already suffering from war and famine.</p><p>The Arba’at dam unleashed a deluge of water on the surrounding area, stranding villagers, the Federal Ministry of Health said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=886132830214103&amp;id=100064521829868&amp;mibextid=qi2Omg&amp;rdid=cBRzsz3ltdWoQ6I1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p><p>It was unclear how many people had been killed in the disaster, which occurred after days of heavy rain. OCHA, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said in a statement on Monday that local authorities had confirmed 30 dead but it added that the number was likely to be much higher. A local news outlet, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MedameekNews/posts/pfbid02wk9mhqx36zW8cye1fm9D3QPUdCELLngNYYx6qGbX8xD8Q5HT9Cvu3DENqnReaJWsl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Medameek News</a>, reported on Monday that more than 10 people had been killed.</p><p>The OCHA report said that the dam, in a remote area near the Red Sea, was the main source of fresh water for Port Sudan, the country’s de facto wartime capital, about 25 miles to the southeast. The dam is over 530 miles from the capital, Khartoum, which is inland.</p></div></div><div><p>According to preliminary reports from OCHA, the bursting of the dam caused its reservoir to empty completely, damaging around 20 villages downstream. The authorities in Sudan reported that up 50,000 people were affected to the west of the dam. OCHA said that damage to communication networks had “made it difficult to gather more accurate information.”</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Buildings near the dam, the collapse of which killed people and flooded downstream villages. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>A <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AlHadath.Sudan/videos/8019566728162364/?vh=e&amp;fs=e&amp;mibextid=iexibG&amp;rdid=wkpvtxY1wSiNplUS" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> shared by the Saudi news outlet Al Hadath showed massive streams of tan-colored floodwaters barreling through a community but could not be independently verified.
