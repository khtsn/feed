He often laments how far the company has fallen, wondering aloud what happened to the jet maker and why it seems incapable of building things anymore.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The two heavily modified Boeing 747s currently used interchangeably to fly the president are more than 30 years old and require extensive servicing. Mr. Trump views Air Force One as a symbol of power and prestige, and he is infuriated that he begins his second term flying around in the same aging planes that once transported President George H.W. Bush.</p><p>His public comments took on a more ominous tone in an interview broadcast Tuesday night on Fox News’s “Hannity.” Seated beside Mr. Musk, the president excoriated the company, saying, “I mean, they are actually in default, Boeing,” before adding: “They’ve been building this thing forever. I don’t know what’s going on.”</p><p>Mr. Trump, in a pointed demonstration about his willingness to explore other options, took time on Saturday to kick the tires on a luxury jet sitting at Palm Beach International Airport. Photographers spotted the tail number of the late model 747-8, which revealed the plane to have been owned, at least until recently, by the Qatari royal family, according to <a href="https://www.airfleets.net/ficheapp/plane-b747-37075.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">registration data.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/multimedia/00dc-airforce1-qat-ptlj/00dc-airforce1-qat-ptlj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/multimedia/00dc-airforce1-qat-ptlj/00dc-airforce1-qat-ptlj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/multimedia/00dc-airforce1-qat-ptlj/00dc-airforce1-qat-ptlj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A jet sits on a tarmac." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/multimedia/00dc-airforce1-qat-ptlj/00dc-airforce1-qat-ptlj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/multimedia/00dc-airforce1-qat-ptlj/00dc-airforce1-qat-ptlj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/multimedia/00dc-airforce1-qat-ptlj/00dc-airforce1-qat-ptlj-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/multimedia/00dc-airforce1-qat-ptlj/00dc-airforce1-qat-ptlj-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/c6e0567c-30d5-5751-891a-a5fd5f168616" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>One radical alternative to waiting on the Boeing jets was to retrofit the Qatari jet Mr. Trump toured over the weekend.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Al Drago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>It is unclear whether any of these options will come to fruition. But depending on how extensive the pullback would be for lowering security requirements, the cost of speeding the production schedule for the new planes could be to compromise the president’s safety, or the nation’s security, if not managed with extreme care. Boeing executives have argued that there is a safe way to do this, by lowering the security standards for certain classes of workers who do not touch the airplanes’ most sensitive systems.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Air Force has already contractually committed to paying Boeing <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_FA862516C6599_9700_-NONE-_-NONE-" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$3.5 billion</a> of the <a href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Selected_Acquisition_Reports/FY_2023_SARS/VC-25B_MSAR_Dec_2023_v3_Cleared.pdf#page=38" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$4.3 billion total</a> set aside for the project.

Decisions made during Mr. Trump’s first term in office are themselves a factor in the delay, said recently departed Air Force officials who helped run the program.</p><p>Boeing’s contract to build the new planes was <a href="https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/1579091/air-force-formalizes-air-force-one-replacement-deal-with-contract-to-boeing/#:~:text=This%20contract%20action%20formalizes%20President,the%20taxpayers%20over%20%241.4%20billion." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first signed in 2018</a>, and the planes were originally expected to be delivered in 2024.</p><p>A Boeing spokeswoman declined to answer questions, writing in a statement, “We don’t have anything to share.”</p><p>Boeing’s executives have indicated to the government that they might not be able to deliver the new Air Force Ones until the end of Mr. Trump’s second term. But Mr. Musk, who is known for setting aggressive — <a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/elon-musk-tesla-self-driving-cars-anniversary-autopilot-1850432357/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in some cases unachievable</a> — deadlines at his companies, has insisted that at least one of the planes can be delivered within a year’s time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Officials involved in the project — a complicated feat of engineering that requires the plane to be capable of evading certain missile attacks or surviving the fallout from a nuclear blast — regard Mr. Musk’s timeline as unrealistic.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Decisions made during Mr. Trump’s first term are themselves a factor in the delay, said recently departed Air Force officials who helped run the program.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Al Drago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The president has told associates that if Mr. Musk can fly a rocket, he can probably figure out an airplane.</p><p>But Mr. Musk’s role in this endeavor adds to the tally of the many conflicts of interest he now has with the federal government. Mr. Musk has more than $2.4 billion in contracts awarded in the past two years with the Air Force, and his SpaceX rocket company competes directly with Boeing’s aerospace division.</p><p>Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, said in response to questions from The New York Times: “It is ridiculous the delivery of a new Air Force One airplane has been delayed for such a long time. President Trump is working on identifying ways to speed up the delivery of a new plane, which has been needed for a while.”</p><h2 id="link-4b6eba40">An Airborne Command Center</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The two heavily modified Boeing 747s currently used interchangeably to fly the president are more than 30 years old.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Some of the more radical alternatives that senior administration officials have offered to simply waiting on the tardy Boeing jets, such as retrofitting the Qatari jet within a year’s time, have been described by current and former Pentagon officials as impractical. A temporary plane that could be certified and converted to be mission ready as an Air Force One could still take years, they said.</p><p>While technically any Air Force aircraft transporting the president is given the designation of Air Force One, in common parlance it refers to the bespoke jets designed to carry the commander in chief. Air Force One is not only a way for the president to travel and a familiar avatar of the U.S. leadership; it is also an airborne command center from which the president, at times of crisis, can steer the nation through wars or responses to attacks, even potentially a nuclear strike.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s personal plane — which went through a significant upgrade after his first term — has gold plating throughout, including on the seatbelt buckles. He often asks passengers whether they prefer his plane, which he calls “Trump Force One,” and his guests invariably say yes.</p><p>Mr. Trump also thinks the Kennedy-era robin’s egg blue and white exterior should be updated with a bolder red, white and blue design.</p><p>While President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had relatively little interest in Boeing’s progress and the project lagged during his administration, Boeing now has to contend with a president who is impatient, bordering on obsessive. During his four years out of power, Mr. Trump kept a model of the new Air Force One at his office at Mar-a-Lago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump using a sword to cut a cake featuring a model of a new Air Force One.
