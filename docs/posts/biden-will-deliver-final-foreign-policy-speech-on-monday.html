Trump, Mr. Biden hopes to use his remaining time to frame his historical legacy as a transformational leader who bolstered the United States at home and abroad even in just one term.</p><p>The effort gets underway at 2 p.m. on Monday with a speech at the State Department focused on what he sees as his successes in the international arena. He plans to say that he strengthened U.S. alliances both in Europe in the face of Russian aggression as well as in the Asian-Pacific amid the rise of China. At the same time, he plans to argue that America’s adversaries — particularly Russia, China and Iran — are all weaker than when he came to office.</p><p>“He’s going to ask the question: is America stronger than we were four years ago? And he’s going to answer the question with a definitive yes,” Jake Sullivan, his national security adviser, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/12/politics/video/sotu-wh-national-security-adviser-says-us-in-stronger-more-secure-position" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a preview</a> on “State of the Union” on CNN on Sunday. “Our alliances are stronger, as I said before. Our enemies and competitors are weaker. We kept the nation out of war. Every element of American power is stronger today.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The speech will be the first this week aimed at presenting the best case for Mr. Biden’s presidency as it comes to an end. He will deliver a broader televised farewell address to the nation in prime time on Wednesday evening, much as many presidents have done. He will also deliver speeches this week on his conservation record and at a farewell ceremony for the commander in chief at Joint Base Myers-Henderson Hall.</p><p>On foreign policy, Mr. Biden has presided over a tumultuous time and Mr. Trump blamed him for the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, although no U.S. troops are directly involved on the ground in either place. Some critics said the perception of a world aflame and spinning out of Mr. Biden’s control contributed to the erosion of his political popularity at home and ultimately his withdrawal from the election under pressure.</p><p>“The fact that Biden is handing the presidency back to his predecessor is in part a reflection of his foreign policy shortcomings,” said Peter Rough, director of the Center on Europe and Eurasia at the Hudson Institute and a former aide to President George W. Bush.</p><p>“For most of his time in office, Biden has been on the defensive, first in Ukraine and then in Gaza,” Mr. Rough continued. “The president’s 1990s-era liberal internationalism may have been well intentioned, but it always felt out of step to me with the power politics of the 2020s.”</p><p>Still, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/654908/image-among-nato-allies-improved-biden.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a new Gallup poll released on Monday</a> showed that America’s standing in Europe has improved strikingly under Mr. Biden. Of 30 NATO allies surveyed, approval of U.S. leadership rose in all but four since 2020, Mr. Trump’s last year in office. Approval ratings rose by double digits in 20 of the 30 countries. In Germany, for instance, approval of U.S. leadership rose from just 6 percent under Mr. Trump to 52 percent under Mr. Biden.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In pulling U.S. troops out of Afghanistan and extricating America from a the longest war in its history, Mr. Biden finally accomplished what his two predecessors wanted to but did not. But the chaotic nature of the withdrawal did considerable damage to both his and the country’s standing in the world.</p><p>Mr. Biden rallied much of the world to stand up to Russia’s unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine and reinvigorated NATO after ties frayed under Mr. Trump, even admitting two new members, Sweden and Finland. He steered tens of billions of dollars worth of American arms to Ukraine that helped thwart Moscow’s attempt to take over the country.</p><p>But Mr. Biden was criticized from two different directions; some complained he was too reticent to deliver more powerful weapons for fear of escalating with a nuclear superpower, while others complained that he was investing too much American treasure in someone else’s war. And after its initial stunning success, Ukraine’s defense has stalled and Mr. Trump is now promising to end the war with what are expected to be concessions to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.</p><p>The war in Gaza that followed the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, was the other dominating crisis of Mr. Biden’s tenure. He stood staunchly by Israel and provided weapons for its all-out assault on Hamas, but eventually grew frustrated with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel who rebuffed American pressure to do more to curb civilian casualties and relieve humanitarian suffering.</p><p>Even now, in his final days, Mr. Biden is straining to seal an elusive cease-fire agreement that would end the fighting and result in the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, including a few with American citizenship. Mr. Sullivan said Sunday that U.S. negotiators were “very, very close” to a deal, but it was not clear it could be finalized by next Monday when Mr. Trump takes over.</p><p>As with Ukraine, Mr. Biden faced criticism from both directions. From one side, he was accused of not doing more to stop the killing of civilians and called “Genocide Joe” at protests. From the other side, he was faulted for putting pressure on Israel to restrain itself in the face of an existential terrorist threat.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.
