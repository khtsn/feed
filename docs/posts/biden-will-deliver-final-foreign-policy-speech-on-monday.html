Trump, Mr. Biden hopes to use his remaining time to frame his historical legacy as a transformational leader who bolstered the United States at home and abroad even in just one term.</p><p>The effort gets underway at 2 p.m. on Monday with a speech at the State Department focused on what he sees as his successes in the international arena. He plans to say that he strengthened U.S. alliances both in Europe in the face of Russian aggression as well as in the Asian-Pacific amid the rise of China. At the same time, he plans to argue that America’s adversaries — particularly Russia, China and Iran — are all weaker than when he came to office.</p><p>“He’s going to ask the question: is America stronger than we were four years ago? And he’s going to answer the question with a definitive yes,” Jake Sullivan, his national security adviser, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/12/politics/video/sotu-wh-national-security-adviser-says-us-in-stronger-more-secure-position" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a preview</a> on “State of the Union” on CNN on Sunday. “Our alliances are stronger, as I said before. Our enemies and competitors are weaker. We kept the nation out of war. Every element of American power is stronger today.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The speech will be the first this week aimed at presenting the best case for Mr. Biden’s presidency as it comes to an end. He will deliver a broader televised farewell address to the nation in prime time on Wednesday evening, much as many presidents have done. He will also deliver speeches this week on his conservation record and at a farewell ceremony for the commander in chief at Joint Base Myers-Henderson Hall.</p><p>On foreign policy, Mr. Biden has presided over a tumultuous time and Mr. Trump blamed him for the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, although no U.S. troops are directly involved on the ground in either place. Some critics said the perception of a world aflame and spinning out of Mr. Biden’s control contributed to the erosion of his political popularity at home and ultimately his withdrawal from the election under pressure.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
