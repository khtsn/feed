(You can ask me if you see me.) But there are some principles to consider before your next flight — guidelines that go beyond the length of your trip — and they have everything to do with how adventurous you are.</p><h2 id="link-7efb4d61">Gather your options right away</h2><p>First of all, some advice gleaned from my partner, an intrepid in-flight movie watcher. When you first sit down, immediately start scrolling through the options. When you see a title that looks interesting, plug it into <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Metacritic</a> and see what the rating is. That will give you a sense of what’s been said about the film.</p><p>You don’t need to pick a film with a high critical score. Sometimes you just want to watch the kind of movie that will never garner critical acclaim. Sometimes that’s what I want, too. But if you’re armed with options before liftoff, you’ll probably find something that fits your mood.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-74645366">Consider the context</h2><p>Perhaps you’re embarking on a long-awaited adventure in a new place. The chances are good that your airline will have a selection of movies from your destination, and this is a great moment to start immersing yourself in the culture. On a flight operated by Icelandair years ago, I navigated to the selection of Icelandic movies and TV shows. All of them were gorgeous and fascinating and very Icelandic. Many seemed to feature sheep.</p><p>Maybe you want the adventure to wait until after you land because you’re a nervous flyer? Then for heaven’s sake, do not watch “Cast Away” or “Red Eye.” Opt for familiarity: A firmly grounded comedy should do it, preferably a silly one. (Not “Airplane!”)</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
