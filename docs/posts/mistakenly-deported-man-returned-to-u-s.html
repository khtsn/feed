    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was deported to El Salvador despite legal protections, was brought back to the U.S. to face <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/us/politics/kilmar-abrego-garcia-us-criminal-charges.html" title="">charges related to transporting undocumented migrants</a></p><p>The move, which was revealed today when an indictment was unsealed at a federal court in Nashville, could provide an offramp for the White House. A series of courts had ordered the U.S. to attempt to secure Abrego Garcia’s return. The Trump administration can now avoid escalating its legal fight while pressing its claim that he was worthy of removal. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/06/us/govuscourtstnmd10462230.html" title="">You can read the full indictment here</a>.</p><p>“Abrego Garcia has landed in the United States to face justice,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said at a news conference this afternoon. “He was a smuggler of humans, and women and children.”</p><p>Abrego Garcia’s lawyers said they welcomed their day in court. “Today’s action proves what we’ve known all along — that the administration had the ability to bring him back and just refused to do so,” one of his lawyers said. “It’s now up to our judicial system to see that Mr. Abrego Garcia receives the due process that the constitution guarantees to all persons.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump and Elon Musk at the White House earlier this year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-5b1ce380">In the Trump-Musk feud, both have a lot at risk</h2><p>The relationship between Donald Trump and his onetime close ally Elon Musk has continued to unravel in private. Trump has been telling associates that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/06/us/elon-musk-trump-feud" title="">Musk’s “crazy” behavior is linked to his drug use</a>, and a White House official said the president planned to sell the Tesla he said he bought as a gesture to Musk.</p><p>Though they seem to have paused their online war <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/05/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-feud-timeline-posts.html" title="">of insults</a>, Trump’s aides said there was no plan for a call between the two.

Musk’s companies have benefited from billions of dollars in government contracts, which Trump threatened to end. For Trump — who has faced little opposition from Congress, and has managed to steamroll the courts — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/us/politics/trump-musk.html" title="">he may have finally found an opponent up for the fight</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christine Zhang</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-3aa949ca">Hiring remained steady</h2><p>Employers added 139,000 jobs last month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/business/jobs-report-may.html" title="">continuing a consistent run of job creation</a> despite signs of drag from tariffs, high interest rates and federal government downsizing.</p><p>Previous months’ figures were revised down by 95,000 jobs, which darkened the picture slightly, and the growth was fueled almost entirely by health care and social assistance.
