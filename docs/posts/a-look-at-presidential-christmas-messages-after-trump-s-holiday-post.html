    <h1>A Look at Presidential Christmas Messages After Trump’s Holiday Post</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Merry Christmas to the “wonderful soldiers of China” and to “Governor Justin Trudeau of Canada” and “the people of Greenland.” As for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/us/politics/biden-commutes-37-death-sentences.html" title="">37 men</a> on federal death row who recently received commutations from President Biden? “GO TO HELL!”</p><p>The messages, posted online by President-elect Donald J. Trump on Christmas, were characteristic for a man known for his bombastic social media presence, but they veered sharply from the standard holiday ideals of unity delivered from the White House. </p><p>The posts, which appeared on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/29/us/politics/trump-truth-social-conspiracy-theories.html" title="">Truth Social</a>, the online platform owned by Mr. Trump’s media company, labeled his opponents as “Radical Left Lunatics,” and once again described the current president as “Sleepy Joe Biden.”</p><p>Mr. Trump’s Christmas comments also hinted at what could be his priorities come Jan. 20, as he spoke about asserting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/us/politics/trump-greenland-panama-canal.html" title="">U.S. control</a> over the Panama Canal and Greenland, which he covets for its reserves of rare earth minerals needed for advanced technology.</p></div></div>
