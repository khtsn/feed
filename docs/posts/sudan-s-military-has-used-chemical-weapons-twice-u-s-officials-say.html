    <h1>Sudan’s Military Has Used Chemical Weapons Twice, U.S. Officials Say</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sudan’s military has used chemical weapons on at least two occasions against the paramilitary group it is battling for control of the country, four senior United States officials said on Thursday.</p><p>The weapons were deployed recently in remote areas of Sudan, and targeted members of the Rapid Support Forces paramilitaries that the army has been fighting since April 2023. But U.S. officials worry the weapons could soon be used in densely populated parts of the capital, Khartoum.</p><p>The revelations about chemical weapons use come as the United States is expected to announce sanctions against the Sudanese military chief, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, for documented atrocities by his troops, including indiscriminate bombing of civilians and the use of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/26/world/africa/sudan-starvation-military-border.html" title="">starvation as a weapon of war</a>.</p><p>The use of chemical weapons crosses yet another boundary in the war between the Sudanese military and the R.S.F., its former ally. By many measures, the war has created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with as many as 150,000 people killed, over 11 million displaced and now the world’s worst famine in decades.</p></div></div>
