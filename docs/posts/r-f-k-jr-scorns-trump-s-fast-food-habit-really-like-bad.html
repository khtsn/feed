    <h1>R.F.K. Jr. Scorns Trump’s Fast Food Habit: ‘Really, Like, Bad’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What happens when a 78-year-old, Diet Coke-drinking, McDonald’s-consuming president-elect buddies up with an alternative medicine aficionado like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/politics/robert-kennedy-jr-donald-trump-health-care.html" title="">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>? He gets publicly chided for his eating habits.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic whose ideas about remaking the nation’s public health system include getting processed food off grocery store shelves, spared no niceties in passing judgment on Mr. Trump’s food choices during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO0qzGdIziY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent interview</a> with Joe Polish, a marketing industry podcaster. His remarks were first reported by <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-trashes-donald-trumps-fast-food-diet-just-poison/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Daily Beast.</a></p><p>“The stuff that he eats is really, like, bad,” Mr. Kennedy said, recounting the offerings on Mr. Trump’s plane. “Campaign food is always bad, but the food that goes onto that airplane is, like, just poison. You have a choice between — you don’t have the choice, you’re either given KFC or Big Macs. That’s, like, when you’re lucky, and then the rest of the stuff I consider kind of inedible.”</p><p>Mr. Kennedy said he recently sat on the plane next to Dana White, the chief executive of the mixed martial arts company Ultimate Fighting Championship. He said Mr. White told him that he would sometimes sit through an hourslong fight with Mr. Trump, “and he’s never seen Trump drink a glass of water.”</p></div></div>
