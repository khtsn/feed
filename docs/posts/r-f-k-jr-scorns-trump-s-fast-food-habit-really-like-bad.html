You have a choice between — you don’t have the choice, you’re either given KFC or Big Macs. That’s, like, when you’re lucky, and then the rest of the stuff I consider kind of inedible.”</p><p>Mr. Kennedy said he recently sat on the plane next to Dana White, the chief executive of the mixed martial arts company Ultimate Fighting Championship.
