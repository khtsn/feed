The rapid renovation had set France on a “course of hope,” he said. Five years of repairs was indeed a historical blip for a cathedral that was begun in 1163 and that took 182 years to complete.</p><p>As the French president spoke, bright spotlights cut into the rain and fog of a chilly December night in Paris.</p><p>It was also a time for diplomacy for Mr. Macron and for France. Both President-elect Donald J. Trump and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, flew to Paris for the event, and Mr. Macron assembled the two men at the Élysée Palace before the ceremony, an opportunity for Mr. Zelensky to press the case for more aid to Ukraine to the skeptical president-elect.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Others in attendance included former French presidents and an assortment of dignitaries, European royalty and the billionaire technology mogul Elon Musk.</p><p>Mr. Trump sat in the front row, between President Macron and his wife, Brigitte. On her other side was Jill Biden, the first lady.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/07/multimedia/07notredame-leadall-2-lcqk/07notredame-leadall-2-lcqk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/07/multimedia/07notredame-leadall-2-lcqk/07notredame-leadall-2-lcqk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/07/multimedia/07notredame-leadall-2-lcqk/07notredame-leadall-2-lcqk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/07/multimedia/07notredame-leadall-2-lcqk/07notredame-leadall-2-lcqk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/07/multimedia/07notredame-leadall-2-lcqk/07notredame-leadall-2-lcqk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/07/multimedia/07notredame-leadall-2-lcqk/07notredame-leadall-2-lcqk-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/07/multimedia/07notredame-leadall-2-lcqk/07notredame-leadall-2-lcqk-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/2da9677e-5e6b-5e12-81f1-cee84f8debd2" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Emmanuel Macron and President-elect Donald J.

The French authorities marshaled more than 840 million euros, or nearly $900 million, in donations from about 340,000 donors to fund the effort. More than 2,000 oak trees were donated from private and public forests.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The fire damage has been almost entirely repaired — the vaults are whole, the 19th-century spire and the wooden attic are back and the interior limestone walls dazzlingly bright and clean.</p><p>The craftsmen who toiled on the project have been memorialized in the restoration. A year ago, a new spire was unveiled at the cathedral complete with a gilded copper figure that contains, in addition to relics of saints, a scroll with the names of the people who took part in the rebuilding. The copper figure is a cross between a rooster and a phoenix, symbol of the cathedral’s rebirth.</p><p>Guests at the ceremony on Saturday also honored the firefighters who had rushed directly into the flames on the evening of April 15, 2019. The fire tore through the cathedral’s wood and lead roofing, destroyed the iconic spire and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/07/16/world/europe/notre-dame.html" title="">seriously endangered its stability</a>.</p><p>At the ceremony, thunderous applause greeted a group of firefighters who appeared at the front of the cathedral in their fluorescent firefighting gear.</p><p>The cathedral will celebrate its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/world/europe/notre-dame-mass.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">first Mass</a> on Sunday to consecrate the altar, which will receive the relics of several saints. Mr. Macron and about 170 bishops from France and elsewhere were expected to attend.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A Mass for the general public was to be offered later on Sunday, and visitors will be able to enter Notre-Dame for the first time since the fire.</p><p>The work on the cathedral is not completely done. Some scaffolding will remain. The lead covering of the base of the spire still needs to be finished. And it will take years more to repair <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/world/europe/paris-notre-dame-renovation.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">the outer wear and tear</a> on the cathedral that had nothing to do with the fire. The area around the cathedral is also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/27/world/europe/notre-dame-cathedral-paris.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">being redesigned</a> to stay cooler during heat waves and to improve the flow of visitors.</p><p>Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Richard Fausset, based in Atlanta, writes about the American South, focusing on politics, culture, race, poverty and criminal justice.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/richard-fausset">More about Richard Fausset</a></span></p></div><div><p>Thomas Fuller, a Page One Correspondent for The Times, writes and rewrites stories for the front page.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/thomas-fuller">More about Thomas Fuller</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>12</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>With Pageantry and Dignitaries, France Unveils a Reborn Notre-Dame<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
