    <h1>Main FAA Warning System, NOTAM, Is Down</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As of 2 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, there had been no further updates about the outage on Mr. Duffy’s official social media accounts or on those of the F.A.A. or the Transportation Department.</p><p>The F.A.A.’s website had a <a href="https://notams.aim.faa.gov/banner/bannerProd.html?button1=" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notice</a> explaining that the agency’s technicians were working to restore “service outages” to the NOTAM system. It was not immediately clear if those outages were in the main NOTAM system or in the backup system, or both, or whether any progress had been made since Mr. Duffy’s announcement late Saturday. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The national airspace system of the United States covers an area of more than 29 million square miles, and the F.A.A. provides air traffic service to more than 45,000 flights a day across that area, <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/nas" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the agency</a>.</p><p>The F.A.A. has been in the process of modernizing the NOTAM system, which has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/25/us/politics/faa-outage-legislation.html" title="">gone down before</a>. After a January 2023 outage, departures across the country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/11/business/faa-flight-delays-outage.html" title="">were halted for about 90 minutes</a>.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.</em></p></div></div>
