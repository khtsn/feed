The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The national airspace system of the United States covers an area of more than 29 million square miles, and the F.A.A. provides air traffic service to more than 45,000 flights a day across that area, <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/nas" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the agency</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mike Ives is a reporter for The Times based in Seoul, covering breaking news around the world.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mike-ives">More about Mike Ives</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
