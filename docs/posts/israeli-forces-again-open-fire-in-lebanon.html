In the renewed violence on Monday, at least two people were killed and 17 others injured, according to Lebanon’s health ministry.</p><p>The Israeli military said in a statement that it had fired “warning shots in order to eliminate threats,” without providing further details about the nature of those threats.</p><p>Wire agency photos showed Israeli forces gathered behind makeshift roadblocks, with flattened southern Lebanese villages visible on the rolling hillsides behind them.

The Lebanese military had sent reinforcements to parts of southern Lebanon earlier in the day, preparing to enter some towns and safeguard civilians, Lebanon’s state-run news agency reported.</p><p>Israeli forces killed at least 24 people and injured over 134 others on Sunday, Lebanese officials said, after thousands of Lebanese marched to southern towns and villages. Those areas remain occupied by Israel past a 60-day deadline for its withdrawal under the November cease-fire agreement, which called for both Israel and Hezbollah forces to leave southern Lebanon and for the Lebanese Army and U.N. peacekeepers to deploy in force there.</p><p>The Israeli military said in a statement on Sunday that it had fired “warning shots” to disperse what it called “rioters.” Last week, Israel had indicated that it would remain in southern Lebanon despite the deadline, amid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/world/middleeast/lebanon-army-ceasefire-israel-hezbollah.html" title="">doubts about the Lebanese Army’s ability to stymie Hezbollah’s resurgence</a>.</p><p>Negotiators had hoped that the U.S.-brokered cease-fire by now would have given way for a more permanent settlement. But as the 60-day deadline elapsed on Sunday, the White House issued a statement stating that the initial agreement would be extended until Feb. 18.</p><p>Hezbollah’s leader, Naim Qassem, said in a speech on Monday that the group did not accept the extension of the cease-fire agreement and called on Israeli forces to withdraw from Lebanon. However, Hezbollah is not a signatory to the deal, and the Lebanese government had already approved the extension after discussions with U.S. officials.</p><p>The flurry of diplomatic activity appeared designed to buy time and stave off further bouts of violence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Women carrying portraits of fighters walking past the rubble of a mosque that was destroyed during the Israeli offensive in the southern Lebanese village of Aita al-Shaab. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mahmoud Zayyat/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli soldiers near Lebanese detainees at the Israeli-Lebanese border, as seen from northern Israel, on Monday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ronen Zvulun/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Qassem said his group reserved “the right to act as it sees fit” if Israel failed to withdraw from the country, but stopped short of delivering a direct threat during his speech on Monday.</p><p>Battered by the deadliest war with Israel in decades, the group has little impetus to reignite a conflict that would only weaken the group further as it attempts to recover, experts say. Instead, Mr. Qassem called on Lebanon’s new leaders to act, and said the international community would be responsible for “any consequences arising from the delay.”</p><p>During a meeting with U.S. officials on Monday, Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, stressed that the extension did “not give Israel any excuse not to withdraw,” according to a statement from his office. He accused Israeli forces of “procrastinating” and said pressure was needed to stop their “repeated violations” of the truce deal.</p><p>The bloodshed on Sunday prompted urgent calls for restraint by the United Nations amid growing fears of a sustained Israeli occupation and renewed hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Residents of Kfar Kila gathered at a Lebanese army checkpoint in Burj al-Muluk, on the outskirts of their village.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rabih Daher/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Even as the cease-fire held, albeit precariously, in Lebanon, the Israeli military said it had “initiated a counterterrorism operation” in the city of Tulkarm in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p><p>The military said its aircraft had killed Ihab Abu Atiwi, who was described as the head of the local branch of Hamas, and circulated images of a car being blown up.
