The Food and Drug Administration’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/16/health/abortion-pills-fda.html" title="">embrace of telehealth abortion</a> began in 2021 under the Biden administration, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/health/abortion-shield-laws-telemedicine.html" title="">shield laws have passed in several states</a> with Democratic political leadership. Vice President Kamala Harris has made protecting abortion rights a central theme of her campaign.</p><p>Former President Donald J.

A future F.D.A. could ban telehealth abortion or reverse its approval of abortion pills altogether. Federal officials could also impose restrictions on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/26/us/comstock-act-abortion.html" title="">mailing any materials</a> used in abortions. A lawsuit working its way through federal courts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/health/abortion-pill-mifepristone-lawsuit.html" title="">seeks similar restrictions</a>.</p><p><a href="https://societyfp.org/research/wecount/." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The new analysis, published Tuesday by WeCount</a>, a group overseen by academic researchers, includes counts of abortions from all known abortion providers in the United States since April 2022. It also uses clinic survey data from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research group, on the number of women traveling between states for abortion care, and comparison data from 2020. Both organizations support abortion rights.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>For the first time, the report breaks out the number of abortions provided under the new shield laws. On average, it found, these laws are enabling 7,700 abortions a month in states with total abortion bans or six-week bans.</p><p>In Mississippi, where abortion has been illegal since July 2022, around 3,300 women got abortions in a six-month period last year, an increase of 16 percent from 2,850 in six months in 2020. Nearly half of women ordered pills under shield laws, and the rest traveled out of state. For women in West Virginia, abortions increased 57 percent, and in Tennessee, 38 percent.</p><p>Telehealth abortions were a big driver of the increases. Across all states, there were an average of 20,000 abortions per month in the period from April to June this year, up from about 8,000 per month in the same period last year. The number of in-person abortions was mostly stable, decreasing 3 percent during that time.</p><p>The expansion of telehealth abortion has been an important factor even in states where abortion has remained legal, especially in rural areas. In Wyoming, where abortion is legal but many women live far from clinics, telehealth accounted for 55 percent of abortions in the second quarter of this year, compared with 8 percent in New York.</p><p>Other factors have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/upshot/abortion-numbers-dobbs.html" title="">also contributed</a> to the increase in abortions, researchers said. New clinics have opened, and a nationwide surge of publicity about the issue may have decreased stigma. Abortion rights groups have helped people get access to abortion financially or logistically, enabling many women to travel out of state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Eighty percent of the abortions counted by WeCount were reported directly by abortion providers or public health departments. The rest, in places that did not provide complete data, especially California, Florida, New Jersey and New York, were estimated based on other information.</p><p>These numbers do not include abortion pills that were ordered from overseas pharmacies, or other abortions that did not involve a licensed U.S. clinician. There is evidence that the number of such abortions, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/04/13/us/abortion-pill-order-online-mifepristone.html" title="">which spiked</a> after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, has decreased since the enactment of shield laws. The research does not measure whether every woman who orders abortion pills ends up taking them.</p><p>Comparisons to 2020 are not exact because the earlier data used slightly different methods. Over the last two years, some states have enacted new abortion restrictions, and some have reversed them. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/01/upshot/florida-abortion-ban.html" title="">Florida’s six-week abortion ban</a> went into effect in May, and Iowa’s six-week ban in July. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html" title="">legal status of abortion</a> also changed in Indiana, South Carolina and Wisconsin during the study period.</p><p>The bans have prevented some women who wanted abortions from getting them. They may not have been able to afford to travel, to find child care or take time off work. Some may have been uncomfortable ordering pills, or unaware of the options. Research suggests that these women tend to be teenagers; to be <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/what-are-the-implications-of-the-dobbs-ruling-for-racial-disparities/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Black and Native American</a>; and to have low incomes.
