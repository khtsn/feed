Its arrival in the heart of Times Square, where it begins a weeklong run on March 15, is timed for Nowruz, the Persian new year celebration.

But in the West, we only hear the drumbeat.”</p><p>The “Shahnameh,” or Book of Kings, is said to be the longest poem ever written by a single author — <a href="https://shahnameh.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">twice as long</a> as the “Iliad” and the “Odyssey” combined.
