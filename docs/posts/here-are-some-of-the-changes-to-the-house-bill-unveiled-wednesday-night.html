The legislation would slash taxes, steer more money to the military and border security, and pay for some of this with cuts to Medicaid, food assistance, education and clean energy programs, adding significantly to federal deficits and to the ranks of the uninsured.</p><div><p>Its passage was a crucial victory for what Mr. Trump and Republicans are calling the “big, beautiful bill,” and the first step in their plan to push it through Congress over unified Democratic opposition using special rules that shield it from a Senate filibuster.</p><p>That process has been fraught with problems given the G.O.P.’s tiny margins of control in both chambers and rampant divisions within its ranks. And the measure is likely to face substantial obstacles in the Senate, where Republicans have far different ideas about what should be in the legislation and a more complicated set of rules for considering such bills.</p><p>But the action in the House, where the measure’s fate was uncertain almost until the last moment, kept the effort on track. </p><p>“After a long week and a long night and countless hours of work over the past year, a lot of prayer and a lot of teamwork, my friends, it quite literally is morning in America,” Mr. Johnson said after 6 a.m. following an all-nighter of a debate on the House floor. “After four long years of President Biden’s failures, President Trump’s America First agenda is finally here, and we are advancing that today.”</p><p>For days, Mr. Johnson had haggled with Republicans from across the ideological spectrum who were demanding changes to the bill and refusing to lend their support. Just hours before the vote, he unveiled a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/21/us/trump-news#here-are-some-of-the-changes-to-the-house-bill-unveiled-wednesday-night" title="">series of concessions</a> to win over disparate factions, including speeding up new work requirements for Medicaid, increasing the state and local tax deduction, expanding a rollback of clean-energy tax credits created by the Biden administration in the Inflation Reduction Act and steering additional money to reimburse states for immigration enforcement efforts.</p><p>Then, he sought to call the bluff of the holdouts, setting a vote on the legislation for the early morning and effectively daring recalcitrant Republicans to oppose it. On the House floor, forced to go on the record on Mr. Trump’s legislative agenda, their opposition collapsed. In the end just two Republicans, Representatives Warren Davidson of Ohio and Thomas Massie of Kentucky — both anti-deficit conservatives — voted against it.</p><p>Representative Andy Harris of Maryland, the chairman of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, voted “present,” a way of protesting the measure without causing its defeat. And two other Republicans who had expressed opposition to the measure ahead of the vote, Representatives David Schweikert of Arizona and Andrew Garbarino of New York, did not show up to vote.</p><p>“This bill is a debt bomb ticking,” Mr. Massie said on the House floor ahead of the vote, explaining his opposition. “We’re not rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic tonight. We’re putting coal in the boiler and setting a course for the iceberg.”</p><p>Mr. Trump had pressed hard for the bill’s passage, visiting the Capitol on Tuesday to pitch Republicans on the legislation, and meeting with holdouts on Wednesday at the White House. Earlier on Wednesday, his administration put out a statement calling the failure to pass the bill “the ultimate betrayal.”</p><p>Still, the legislation has a long and challenging road ahead of it.</p><p>It is expected to face substantial changes in the Senate. A group of fiscal conservatives has demanded structural changes and cuts to Medicaid and other programs to hold down the overall cost of the bill and rein in deficits. More moderate and politically vulnerable lawmakers have sought to protect Medicaid and fought to preserve clean energy tax credits.</p><p>Cost estimates for the changes Mr. Johnson made late on Wednesday night to the legislation were not yet available.</p><p>But the bill as originally written had been expected to add trillions to the national debt, which is already at a level that many economists and Wall Street investors find alarming. In a preliminary analysis of an earlier version of the bill, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the legislation would add roughly $2.3 trillion to the debt over the next decade.</p><p>“The deficit hawks have become chicken hawks tonight, in submission to Trump, the self-described king of debt,” Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, said on the House floor.</p><p>In a separate analysis requested by Democrats, the budget office found that the legislation would leave the poorest Americans worse off while providing a lift to the richest. In 2027, the bottom 10 percent would lose the equivalent of 2 percent of their income largely because of the reduced benefits, while the tax cuts would provide the top 10 percent with a 4 percent increase to their income, the budget office estimated.</p><p>Before the legislation passed early on Thursday morning, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the Democratic leader, predicted that Republicans’s votes would come back to haunt them at the ballot box.</p><p>“I think that when the story is told of the 119th Congress, when the votes are ultimately cast on that first Tuesday in November next year,” Mr. Jeffries said, “that this day may very well turn out to be the day that House Republicans lost control of the United States.”</p><p>Among the concessions Mr. Johnson made to conservatives in the hopes of winning their votes was speeding up when work requirements for Medicaid would kick in by two years — from 2029 to the end of 2026. The legislation is projected to cause around 10 million Americans to become uninsured, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</p><p>The bill now also contains a faster phaseout of existing tax credits for low-carbon electricity. Under the new language, companies building solar, wind, geothermal or battery plants could only claim the credit if they started construction within 60 days of the bill passing into law and then put the plant in service by the end of 2028, a narrow window that many businesses might struggle to meet.</p><p>In a nod to the blue-state Republicans in the conference, G.O.P. leaders also included a larger increase to the $10,000 limit on the state and local tax deduction, a key demand from a small group of lawmakers from New York, New Jersey and California.</p><p>The legislation would set the cap at $40,000, an increase from the $30,000 limit in the earlier draft of the legislation. The size of the deduction would shrink for people making more than $500,000 a year, rather than the $400,000 level included under the previous version of the bill.</p><p>Michael Gold<!-- -->, <!-- -->Andrew Duehren<!-- -->, <!-- -->Margot Sanger-Katz<!-- -->, <!-- -->Brad Plumer<!-- -->, <!-- -->Robert Jimison<!-- -->, <!-- -->Maya C.

Kennedy Jr. believes are key drivers of chronic disease in children, including ultra-processed foods, vaccination and environmental toxins like chemicals.</p><p>The report, from the White House’s Make America Healthy Again Commission, led by Mr. Kennedy, will not offer specific policy prescriptions, according to people familiar with it who insisted on anonymity to speak in advance of its release. Rather, it will be a high-level statement declaring that the nation is in a health crisis, identifying certain causes and offering a blueprint for further investigation and reform.</p><div><p>Mr. Trump established the commission in February to examine what he called the “growing health crisis in America.” But he asked the panel to begin by looking at chronic disease in children.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy has repeatedly said that the United States is suffering from an epidemic of chronic disease that is particularly acute in children, citing the rising incidences of autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p><p>“To fully address the growing health crisis in America, we must re-direct our national focus,” <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the executive order</a> establishing the commission declared, adding, “This includes fresh thinking on nutrition, physical activity, healthy lifestyles, over-reliance on medication and treatments, the effects of new technological habits, environmental impacts, and food and drug quality and safety.”</p><p>The executive order paints an especially dark picture of Americans’ health. It notes, for instance, that the United States had the highest incidence rate of cancer in 2021 out of 204 countries and territories, and has experienced an “88 percent increase in cancer” since 1990. But it does not note that <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/annual-report-nation-cancer-deaths-continue-decline" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">death rates for cancer</a> have been steadily declining in the United States.</p><p>Among other instructions, the order directs the commission to examine harms it suggests are caused by antidepressants and electromagnetic radiation.</p><p>The order does not mention two factors that the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-disease/prevention/index.html#:~:text=Most%20chronic%20diseases%20are%20caused,feeling%20good%2C%20and%20living%20longer." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> lists as the main causes of chronic disease: smoking and excessive alcohol use. The Trump administration is shuttering the C.D.C.’s Office on Smoking and Health, and has fired the top tobacco regulator at the Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy has previously blamed ultra-processed foods, which are expected to feature heavily in the report, as a major cause of chronic diseases in the United States, and has promised to “fix our food supply.”</p><p>But administration actions in the last few months have in some cases contradicted that goal. In March, the Agriculture Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/business/farmers-food-bank-budget-cuts.html" title="">abruptly ended a program</a> that provided produce from local farms to schools. Scientists at Harvard and Cornell have lost funding for research aiming to improve the diets of children and teens. And Kevin Hall, a researcher who led some of the most highly cited studies on ultra-processed foods, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/well/kevin-hall-nutrition-retirement-nih-censorship-rfk-maha.html" title="">left the National Institutes of Health in April, citing censorship</a>.</p><p>The report is being spearheaded by Calley Means, who is a special adviser to the White House on health issues and a Kennedy ally. The commission is composed of cabinet secretaries and top federal health officials, including the heads of the C.D.C., the F.D.A. and the N.I.H.</p><p>The panel’s report has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/rfk-pesticides-farmers-hyde-smith.html" title="">generating pushback</a> even before its release. Some Republican lawmakers and industry representatives complained this week about the report’s expected focus on widely used agricultural chemicals, including glyphosate, the key ingredient in an herbicide marketed as Roundup.</p><p>When Mr. Kennedy testified on Tuesday before members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, Republican of Mississippi, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/rfk-pesticides-farmers-hyde-smith.html" title="">warned him</a> and the commission to not to insinuate that the agricultural chemical is unsafe or responsible for childhood disease because doing so could greatly damage farmers. She referred to scientific studies, including an assessment from the Environmental Protection Agency that found the chemical safe when used as directed.</p><p>“I trust your report will be described as an initial assessment of things to be considered but yet to be determined,” the senator said. Mr. Kennedy assured her that he understood that farmers rely on glyphosate and “we are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.”</p><p>Alice Callahan<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2YyNTFkMjIwLTIwZjgtNWE0NC05OTQ0LTIzYTA5MWI1NDNmZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/22/us/trump-news-updates#bill-would-give-newborns-1000-in-trump-accounts" data-source-id="100000010184133"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/andrew-duehren"><img alt="Andrew Duehren" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/06/reader-center/author-andrew-duehren/author-andrew-duehren-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/06/reader-center/author-andrew-duehren/author-andrew-duehren-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/06/reader-center/author-andrew-duehren/author-andrew-duehren-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-22T03:51:44.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 21, 2025, 11:51 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Under the bill, children born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Jan. 1, 2029, would receive the money, which would be invested on their behalf in financial markets.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jimena Peck for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/22/us/trump-news-updates" title=""><em>Follow live updates on Republicans’ domestic policy bill</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>When Republicans first rolled out a proposal last week to invest $1,000 on behalf of every American baby born over the next four years, they were not exactly subtle about whom the public should credit for the cash.</p><div><p>The original draft called for the funds to be put into new a “money account for growth and advancement,” or, as the bill suggested they be called, a “MAGA account.”</p><p>Apparently, though, endowing the accounts with the name of President Trump’s political movement was not clear enough. As part of a series of last-minute changes House Republicans made to their broad fiscal package Wednesday night, they decided to just cut to the chase. The money would now be deposited in a “Trump account.”</p><p>Under the bill, children born between Jan., 1, 2025, and Jan. 1, 2029, would receive the money, which would be invested on their behalf in financial markets. Once they had grown up, they could withdraw the proceeds to pay for certain expenses, including going to college or buying a house. The child’s parents, or other third parties, could also contribute to the account.</p><p>While the benefit of the $1,000 initial investment from the government is clear, the accounts have otherwise puzzled tax experts. People could only contribute post-tax income to the accounts, and gains in the accounts would also be taxed when money was withdrawn. That would appear to make the “Trump account” function much like a typical investment account, rather than a tax-advantaged account like an individual retirement account or a health savings account.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2ZkNDMwM2RlLTNhZDAtNTUzYi05MzIxLTNhMDRlZDVmZDU5OQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/22/us/trump-news-updates#here-are-some-of-the-changes-to-the-house-bill-unveiled-wednesday-night" data-source-id="100000010184165"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/the-new-york-times"><img alt="The New York Times" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-22T03:00:47.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 21, 2025, 11:00 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Republicans unveiled changes to their wide-ranging tax-and-spending bill late Wednesday night.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Republicans unveiled changes to their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/us/politics/one-big-beautiful-bill-house-trump.html" title="">wide-ranging tax-and-spending bill</a> late Wednesday night in a key committee that had to approve the amendments before moving the legislation to the House floor. </p><p>Speaker Mike Johnson and his deputies had spent the day and evening toiling behind the scenes to hammer out enough concessions to cobble together the votes in their fractious ranks to push it through the House. The bill eventually <a href="#trump-bill-house-vote-passes" title="">prevailed by a single vote, 215-214</a>, after an overnight debate ended with a<span>  </span>mostly party line vote on Thursday.</p><div><p>Here are a few of the changes:</p><ul><li><p>Republicans raised the limit on the state and local tax deduction by $10,000, fulfilling a key demand from a small group of lawmakers from New York, New Jersey and California. The amendment would set the cap at $40,000 instead of $30,000. The size of the deduction would shrink for people making more than $500,000 a year, rather than the $400,000 level included under the previous version of the bill.</p></li><li><p>A faster phaseout of existing tax credits for low-carbon electricity has been added to the bill. Under the new language, companies building solar-, wind-, geothermal- or battery-powered plants could claim the credit only if they started construction within 60 days of the bill being signed into law and then put the plant in service by the end of 2028. That’s a narrow window that many projects would struggle to meet. There’s an exception for nuclear power: A company building a new nuclear reactor could still claim a significant tax break as long as it started construction by the end of 2028.</p></li><li><p>A provision was removed that would have sold off 500,000 acres of public land in Utah and Nevada. That measure was strongly opposed by Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, who was interior secretary during President Trump’s first term.</p></li><li><p>The date was pushed up for when Medicaid work requirements would be put in place, from Jan. 1, 2029, to “not later than Dec. 31, 2026.” States also would have the option to select an earlier date to add requirements.</p></li><li><p>Around $12 billion in funds were added to the bill that would be used to reimburse states for money spent on border security after the inauguration of President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in 2021. The legislation already included $175 billion in new spending to enforce Mr. Trump’s immigration and detention policy, a measure that was meant to entice Republicans to vote for the package despite other cuts.</p></li><li><p>A ban on the use of Medicaid funds for gender transition measures like puberty blockers, hormones and surgical procedures was expanded to include adults, not just children and teenagers.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzZiYzUxYWZjLWJiOWEtNTliZC1hN2EzLTJhOGFjMjhiYjdkOA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/22/us/trump-news-updates#trump-abrego-garcia-el-salvador-deportation" data-source-id="100000010153184"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hamed-aleaziz"><img alt="Hamed Aleaziz" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/reader-center/author-hamed-aleaziz/author-hamed-aleaziz-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/reader-center/author-hamed-aleaziz/author-hamed-aleaziz-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/reader-center/author-hamed-aleaziz/author-hamed-aleaziz-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alan-feuer"><img alt="Alan Feuer" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/20/reader-center/author-alan-feuer/author-alan-feuer-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/20/reader-center/author-alan-feuer/author-alan-feuer-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/20/reader-center/author-alan-feuer/author-alan-feuer-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-21T22:31:56.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 21, 2025, 6:31 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hamed-aleaziz" itemprop="name">Hamed Aleaziz</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alan-feuer" itemprop="name">Alan Feuer</a></p><p>Hamed Aleaziz and Alan Feuer cover the legal cases arising from the Trump administration’s deportation policies.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia remains locked up in El Salvador despite court rulings demanding that the United States work toward securing his release.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Allison Bailey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>A mistake had been made. That much was clear.</p><p>The Trump administration had deported a Maryland man named <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/abrego-garcia-mistakenly-deported.html" title="">Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia</a> to a prison in El Salvador, even though a judge had issued a ruling expressly prohibiting that from happening.</p><div><p>But when the news reached the Department of Homeland Security, it set off a dayslong scramble and clashes among officials in three different agencies over how to deal with what everyone knew had been an error. As it became clear that keeping it quiet was not an option, D.H.S. officials floated a series of ideas to control the story that raised alarms among Justice Department lawyers on the case.</p><p>In the days before the government’s error became public, D.H.S. officials discussed trying to portray Mr. Abrego Garcia as a “leader” of the violent street gang MS-13, even though they could find no evidence to support the claim. They considered ways to nullify the original order that barred his deportation to El Salvador. They sought to downplay the danger he might face in one of that country’s most notorious prisons.</p><p>And in the end, a senior Justice Department lawyer, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/justice-dept-immigration-lawyer-leave.html" title="">Erez Reuveni</a>, who counseled bringing Mr. Abrego Garcia back to the United States, was fired for what Attorney General Pam Bondi said was a failure to “zealously advocate on behalf of the United States.”</p><p>Documents obtained by The New York Times laying out the debate among leading lawyers at the State, Justice and Homeland Security Departments reveal new details of the administration’s early efforts to develop a strategy for a case that has become a major test of President Trump’s mass deportation effort.</p><p>The discussions do not directly capture any conversations about the case inside the White House or at the level of the relevant cabinet secretaries. But the documents show how Trump officials, from the start, tried to keep Mr. Abrego Garcia out of the reach of the American judicial system.</p><p>To this day, Mr. Abrego Garcia remains locked up in El Salvador despite court rulings demanding that the United States work toward securing his release. And he got there in the first place through what everyone agreed was a bureaucratic slip-up.</p><p>“This was an administrative error,” James Percival, a D.H.S. official appointed by Mr. Trump, wrote to his colleagues on March 30. “(Not that we should say publicly.)”</p><p>Tricia McLaughlin, a D.H.S. spokeswoman, said in a statement that Mr. Abrego Garcia’s deportation was part of “a highly sensitive counterterrorism operation with national security implications.”</p><p>“We invoked the state secrets privilege over many of the details — of course our officials discussed what should be divulged publicly,” she added. “This just proves they are responsible public servants putting the safety of the American people first. The leakers of these emails, on the other hand, clearly do not care about public safety.”</p><h2 id="link-4c592250">Far-Reaching Consequences</h2><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The main entrance to the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, where the Salvadorans had placed Mr. Abrego Garcia with members of the gang Barrio 18.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fred Ramos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>According to the documents, administration officials realized quickly that the case had sweeping implications for Mr. Trump’s efforts to remove other immigrants from the United States and send them to a Salvadoran megaprison.</p><p>As Mr. Reuveni pointed out to the group, the case potentially “jeopardizes many far more important initiatives of the current administration.” If the government fought and lost, it could have legal repercussions, not least of which for the nearly 140 Venezuelans who were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/us/politics/trump-deportations-venezuela-el-salvador.html" title="">sent to the same facility</a> under the authority of a rarely used wartime law, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/alien-enemies-act-trump.html" title="">Alien Enemies Act</a> of 1798.</p><p>Ultimately, three courts — including the Supreme Court — pushed back against the White House, ordering Trump officials to at least take steps toward freeing Mr. Abrego Garcia. But Mr. Trump and some of his top aides have taken a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/doj-trump-deportation-abrego-garcia.html" title="">defiant stance</a>, insisting that Mr. Abrego Garcia will not be coming back to the United States.</p><p>The turmoil started on March 12, when Mr. Abrego Garcia was arrested as he drove home from work in Maryland, swept up as immigration agents scrambled to meet one of Mr. Trump signature promises: the biggest deportation operation in U.S. history.</p><p>Mr. Abrego Garcia had been under deportation orders, but there was a catch: In 2019, an immigration judge found that he could be deported to anywhere except El Salvador, his homeland, because his life was in danger there.</p><p>But on March 15, El Salvador is where the United States sent him, on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/timeline-trump-deportation-flights-el-salvador.html" title="">one of three charter planes</a> with scores of other immigrants.

Migrants wrongfully removed from the country had been brought back under both Republican and Democratic administrations — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-deportation-maryland-man.html" title="">including during Mr. Trump’s first term</a>.</p><p>One of Mr. Reuveni’s chief concerns was that Judge Xinis would not look kindly on the fact that the U.S. government was keeping someone abroad who had been wrongfully removed.</p><p>“I do not think the court will receive the suggestion it’s fine to keep him there while we sort this out with any sympathy,” he wrote. “And the longer he stays there, the more difficult it becomes for us to hold the line on this is not our own custody just paid through the El Salvadorans.”</p><p>D.H.S. officials said they wanted to solve the problem by trying to reverse the original order that should have kept Mr. Abrego Garcia from being sent to El Salvador in the first place. And they wanted to do so while he was still in Salvadoran custody.</p><p>Mr. Reuveni did not agree.</p><p>“How do we reopen his removal proceedings with him abroad?” he asked. “At that point he won’t have a valid executable order.”</p><p>“The cleanest solution,” Mr. Reuveni had said just days before, was to bring Mr. Abrego Garcia back to U.S. soil.</p><h2 id="link-377f4aea">The P.R.

Mr. Percival, for instance, had asked his colleagues early on if the D.H.S. spokeswoman had been informed about the “comms implications” of the case.</p><p>Mr. Percival appeared to quickly realize that withholding the information was not tenable. A day after telling his colleagues that the government should not admit its error publicly, he reversed course and suggested the Justice Department’s response in court “would be much better if we could own that we made a mistake.”</p><p>“But I guess we need to figure out whether we’re allowed to say that…” he added.</p><p>Around the same time, officials at D.H.S. began to float the idea internally that Mr. Abrego Garcia was a leader in MS-13, a violent street gang at the center of the president’s deportation agenda.</p><p>If that were the case, it might make leaving him in El Salvador more palatable.</p><p>The only problem was that nobody seemed to know if it was true.</p><p>Mr. Percival asked other officials at one point whether they could tell Judge Xinis that Mr. Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 leader. Mr. Reuveni said that they could — but only if someone put their name to the accusation in a sworn court declaration.</p><p>Mr. Percival also wanted to say that Mr. Abrego Garcia was not in any immediate danger.</p><p>In the end, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials backed away from the claims.</p><p>“So far I have found ‘verified member,’ which is included,” an ICE lawyer wrote to Mr. Percival. “I have not found anything indicating ‘leader,’ but I’ll keep looking.”</p><p>In a statement, a Justice Department spokesman said that Mr. Abrego Garcia “was illegally in our country and has been identified as a member of MS-13, a foreign terrorist organization, by multiple officials, including an immigration judge and an appellate board.”</p><p>Mr. Abrego Garcia has never been charged with, let alone convicted of, being a member of the gang. He has said that he came to the United States illegally more than a decade ago because he was fleeing a different gang, Barrio 18.</p><p>During his deportation proceedings in 2019, some evidence was introduced that he belonged to MS-13, but Judge Xinis has cast doubt on it, saying in a court order that the “‘evidence’ against Abrego Garcia consisted of nothing more than his Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie, and a vague, uncorroborated allegation from a confidential informant.”</p><p>In 2019, an immigration judge in Maryland had ruled that Mr. Abrego Garcia should not be sent to El Salvador at all because the gang was “targeting him and threatening him with death” over his family’s business selling pupusas.</p><p>The gang had menaced Mr. Abrego Garcia’s older brother, Cesar, and then turned its eyes on him after Cesar fled to the United States. When Mr. Abrego Garcia refused to join Barrio 18, some of its members threatened to kill him, the judge determined, prompting him to follow his brother to America.</p><p>Because of the potential danger that Mr. Abrego Garcia faced from members of Barrio 18 inside El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, a State Department official, James L. Bischoff, asked officials from both the Justice and Homeland Security Departments what he should advise the U.S. ambassador in San Salvador to do: Should the ambassador ask the Salvadorans to keep Mr. Abrego Garcia separate from the prison’s gang population or ask for his release?</p><p>Mr. Reuveni’s answer was clear. They needed to do both.</p><p>“We should seek to keep him from the gangs,” he wrote, “but more importantly and soonest should bring him back.”</p><p>Mr. Mazzara, the D.H.S. lawyer, told his colleagues that Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, had taken steps to seek Mr. Abrego Garcia’s segregation from other inmates, including members of Barrio 18. And the next day, he said the administration was still waiting for assurances from El Salvador that he was safe in the prison.</p><p>But Mr. Mazzara still seemed unconvinced that the gang was a threat to Mr. Abrego Garcia.</p><p>“Is Barrio 18 even in CECOT?” he asked.</p><p>In fact, the documents show that Mr. Bischoff had told Mr. Mazzara two days earlier that there were “many members of Barrio 18 in CECOT.”</p><h2 id="link-f302296">‘We Concede the Facts’</h2><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Officials at the Department of Homeland Security floated the idea that Mr. Abrego Garcia was a leader in MS-13, a violent street gang at the center of the president’s deportation agenda, despite a lack of evidence.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Valerie Plesch for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The tensions between Mr. Reuveni and his homeland security colleagues came to a head on April 4, when he appeared for the first time in court before Judge Xinis.</p><p>“We concede the facts,” he immediately told her. “This person should — the plaintiff, Abrego Garcia — should not have been removed. That is not in dispute.”</p><p>Mr. Reuveni went on to explain that although there was a final order allowing Mr. Abrego Garcia to be deported from the United States, there was also another — known as a withholding of removal order — that was supposed to have ensured that he was not sent to El Salvador, where he might face persecution.</p><p>Judge Xinis thanked him for his candor, but said she had more questions. Mr. Abrego Garcia had been living in Maryland under the protection of the withholding order for nearly six years, so what authority, she asked, had law enforcement officials used when they took him off the streets on March 12?</p><p>“Your honor, my answer to a lot of these questions is going to be frustrating,” Mr. Reuveni replied. “I am also frustrated that I have no answers for you on a lot of these questions.”</p><p>The hearing, which took place on a Friday afternoon, ended with Judge Xinis entering an order clearly instructing the White House to bring Mr. Abrego Garcia back to the United States by no later than 11:59 p.m. that Monday night.</p><p>The order did not survive. The Supreme Court, quickly stepping in, first put it on hold and then issued an order directing the administration to “facilitate” Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release from Salvadoran custody.</p><p>By the time that order came down, however, Mr. Reuveni was already out of a job.</p><p>On Saturday, April 5, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/justice-dept-immigration-lawyer-leave.html" title="">Justice Department leadership suspended — and ultimately fired — him.</a></p><p>“At my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States,” Ms. Bondi, the attorney general, wrote in a statement sent to The Times that day. “Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences.”</p><p>The case has moved forward without Mr. Reuveni, who declined to be interviewed for this article. Judge Xinis has opened an inquiry into what steps the White House has taken to comply with the Supreme Court’s ruling.</p><p>Joseph A. Darrow, who is one of Mr. Reuveni’s former colleagues and left his own job in the immigration section last month, said in an interview that people in the office were “shocked and despondent” over the retribution that Mr. Reuveni faced.</p><p>Two other lawyers who worked with Mr. Reuveni also left in recent weeks, citing his firing.</p><p>“I agree with what Joe wrote in his goodbye email — this was an act of intimidation against all the attorneys who work here,” said Erin Ryan, a trial lawyer who announced her resignation on May 16 in an email.</p><p>She said it “put us in an impossible position where we have to decide between keeping this job pushing a partisan agenda, or maintaining our ethical obligation to the court and thus our bar license.</p><p>“I choose the latter.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2JiNTEzYzY2LTRkY2EtNTBhNi05ODZkLTgxZDlhMzA1MzA5ZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/22/us/trump-news-updates#inquiry-pam-bondi-qatar-jet-trump" data-source-id="100000010182654"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-gold"><img alt="Michael Gold" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-michael-gold/author-michael-gold-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-michael-gold/author-michael-gold-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-michael-gold/author-michael-gold-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-21T20:00:05.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 21, 2025, 4:00 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Attorney General Pam Bondi at the White House in March.

Durbin of Illinois, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Alex Padilla of California, Peter Welch of Vermont and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island.</p><p>It came as the United States formally accepted the gift of the jet, which industry executives estimated to be worth about $200 million, and which will require extensive work before it can be considered secure enough to carry Mr. Trump.</p><p>The senators questioned Ms. Bondi’s involvement given her previous work as a lobbyist who counted Qatar among her clients. Any role she played in the transfer of the plane, the senators wrote, was a “plain conflict of interest that undermines the public’s trust.”</p><p>Members of Congress from both parties have repeatedly expressed concern over the plane deal. They have said the Qataris might be trying to unduly sway Mr. Trump, that it may not be financially prudent to refit the plane with necessary security measures only to eventually transfer it out of government service and that Mr. Trump’s urgent desire for a new plane might pressure contractors to work quickly and cut corners.</p><p>Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, has already targeted Ms. Bondi’s involvement, announcing that he would place holds on Justice Department nominees until Ms. Bondi explained why she approved the arrangement. The effects of his move would likely be limited, slowing nominations by requiring the Senate’s Republican majority to take procedural votes.</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Schumer introduced a bill that would essentially block the deal by barring the Pentagon from using any federal dollars to buy, modify or maintain such an aircraft for the president’s use.</p><p>Other Democratic lawmakers have also introduced nonbinding resolutions that would require the White House to seek approval before accepting the plane as a gift.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzQwN2VmYzAyLWUxOWYtNTRlZi05NmVhLTM0ZWRmMzFhNWI4MA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/22/us/trump-news-updates#no-tax-on-tips-bill" data-source-id="100000010181864"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/julia-moskin"><img alt="Julia Moskin" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/25/multimedia/author-julia-moskin/author-julia-moskin-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/25/multimedia/author-julia-moskin/author-julia-moskin-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/25/multimedia/author-julia-moskin/author-julia-moskin-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-21T19:23:58.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 21, 2025, 3:23 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Legislation being negotiated in Congress would allow restaurant and other tipped workers to deduct tips from their federal income taxes.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chris Delmas/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>As a slogan in last year’s presidential campaign, “no tax on tips” was short, memorable and effective.</p><p>As tax policy, it is more complex.</p><div><p>On Tuesday, the Senate <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-unexpectedly-passes-no-tax-tips-act-unanimous-vote-rcna208093https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/21/senate-passes-no-tax-on-tips-bill" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unanimously passed</a> the No Tax on Tips <a href="https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruzs-no-tax-on-tips-legislation-passes-senate" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Act</a>, following through on a vow made by both President Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris to give tipped workers a tax break on gratuities. As of now, the tax break is being incorporated into the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/business/trump-taxes-tips.html" title="">“One, Big, Beautiful” budget bill</a> being negotiated by House Republicans, which would be effective from 2026 through 2028.</p><p>How would these changes affect food-industry workers and diners? Here’s what we’ve learned from interviews with tax lawyers, hospitality professors and industry groups:</p><h2 id="link-6dbd9f17">How are restaurant employees currently taxed on tips?</h2><p>The federal tax code requires that every tip be reported as income. Whether it’s a $20 bill handed to a host, a line filled in on a check or a button pressed on a keypad, employees and employers are required to track and report every cent. This applies whether each worker keeps the tips or the money is pooled and redistributed.</p><h2 id="link-712233d5">What counts as a tip?</h2><p>In the tax code and in this legislation, the term “cash tip” applies to tips given in bills and coins, on a credit or debit card, or via the business’s electronic payment system. It has not yet been determined whether tips that go directly to a server via a service like Venmo or PayPal would qualify as cash. Service charges, which are legal in some places, are added by the business and do not count as tips.</p><h2 id="link-a7d26e2">What is the proposed change?</h2><p>Under the legislation being negotiated in the House, tip income would be exempt from federal income taxes. That amount would be subtracted from reported income as an “above the line” deduction on a tax return. That would reduce how much income tax is owed. The tips would still have to be tracked and reported.</p><h2 id="link-6c057c">Who would get the deduction?</h2><p>There is debate over who would benefit from the measure, which applies to all tipped workers in the restaurant business, including not only servers but also baristas, food delivery drivers and anyone holding out a payment screen after they have sold you food. According to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/2022/may/oes353031.htm#nat" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">government data</a>, there are more than two million tipped restaurant workers in the United States.</p><h2 id="link-5c216ff8">How would this affect restaurant employees?</h2><p>It would put more money in the pockets of tipped workers, like servers and bartenders, who interact directly with customers. Those employees would be able to deduct up to $25,000 in tips, unless they earned more than $160,000 in a year. (The amount will rise over time.)</p><h2 id="link-520644df">Does this affect the tipped minimum wage?</h2><p>No. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. (Many states and cities have higher ones.) Employers have been allowed to pay <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/business/economy/tipped-wage-subminimum.html" title="">tipped</a> workers just $2.13 of that sum since 1991. They can pay the lower wage only when the employee’s tips bring the total up to minimum wage. Those tips are also subject to income tax.</p><h2 id="link-15e626fd">Would the change result in customers being asked to tip in more places?</h2><p>Not necessarily. The measure applies only to employees who are “customarily” tipped, to be determined by the Treasury Department. Making tips tax-free might motivate businesses to encourage tipping, in order to retain employees who are chasing this deduction. It would be unlikely to reduce tipping prompts or the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/business/economy/tipped-workers-taxes.html" title="">growing trend</a> of tipping on more services.</p><h2 id="link-7776e2ca">How much of my tip goes directly to the server?</h2><p>That depends on the workplace and local laws. Some restaurants allow servers to keep all their tips; others require tip pooling, which shares the money with bussers, bartenders and other staff members. This bill would not change who receives tips or how they are distributed.</p><h2 id="link-7fdf2e48">Does tipping in cash make a difference?</h2><p>Not for tax purposes. It does reduce a restaurant’s credit card processing fees, which are charged as a percentage of the total bill (about 2 percent to 3.5 percent of each transaction, and sometimes a 30-cent “swipe” fee). But it doesn’t leave a paper trail for the employee or employer to track, which can increase the risk of tax fraud. Some cash tips go unreported, which is considered tax evasion, but the scale of the problem has never been determined.</p><h2 id="link-101b770e">Would this change federal rules that prevent kitchen workers from receiving tips?</h2><p>No. So-called back-of-house employees, including chefs, cooks, dishwashers and porters, cannot receive any tips unless they participate in a legal tip pool. There are federal regulations that govern tip pools, and some provisions vary <a href="https://www.7shifts.com/blog/restaurant-tip-pooling-laws/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state by state</a>.</p><h2 id="link-3bf32370">Would tips continue to count as payroll, for federal tax purposes?</h2><p>Yes. In addition to withholding employee contributions for Medicare, Social Security (FICA) and unemployment, employers must pay taxes for those programs based on the employees’ total wages, which include tips.</p><h2 id="link-2610abac">Will employers of tipped workers continue to get a tip credit?</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/business/economy/tipped-wage-subminimum.html" title="">tip credit,</a> officially called the 45B tax credit, helps employers of tipped employees by reducing their tax bill. They receive a credit for a portion of the Medicare and Social Security taxes they pay on tipped wages that exceed the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage. The proposed legislation would expand that credit to beauty businesses like salons and spas, but the restaurant portion would stay the same.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>New York Times Cooking on Instagram</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/nytcooking" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>YouTube</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nytcooking?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>TikTok</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Pinterest</em></a><em>. </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking" title=""><em>Get regular updates from New York Times Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
