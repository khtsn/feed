It remains standing, but the venue was unable to host their celebration on Jan. 10. “They said we either had to change the date or get a full refund,” Ms. Klein said. “We got a full refund the same day.”</p><p>The couple, who live in New Jersey, needed to find a new venue in the midst of this growing tragedy, knowing still how fortunate they were. Rescheduling was not an option, they said. Ms. Klein’s two older sisters and a high school friend swooped in to help.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The women called 15 venues in the Los Angeles area all of which were open to assisting them. Then they had one last idea. Should they call the Ritz just for fun, someone asked in the group text. “It wasn’t on our original list because of cost,” Ms. Klein said.</p><p>When they called the Ritz-Carlton, Marina del Rey, Jessica Lange, a senior sales manager, asked, “‘What was your refund?’” Ms. Klein said.<span>  </span>When she told them, Ms. Lange said, “That’s all you’ll pay.”</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
