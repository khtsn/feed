Congress may also pass federal voting laws.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As Democrats debate how best to challenge the Trump administration’s rapid expansion of executive power, the lawsuit represents one of the first moments where seemingly every arm of the party is pushing back with one voice.</p><p>Such unity is further evidence that Democrats still view the issue of democracy as core to their political brand, as well as a key issue that can help them claw back support with voters as they aim to build a new coalition ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. In February, Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/democrats-file-lawsuit-against-trump.html" title="">sued the Trump administration</a> over attempts to control the Federal Election Commission. Weeks earlier, the D.N.C. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/democrats-georgia-ballot-law-trump.html" title="">joined a lawsuit</a> over new voting laws in Georgia.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/politics/trump-elections-voting-executive-order.html" title="">executive order signed by Mr. Trump</a> last week calls for a documentary proof of citizenship requirement for voters to register for federal elections. It also aims to set a national deadline for mail ballots by threatening to withhold federal funding from any state that accepts ballots postmarked before Election Day but arriving in the days after. At least 17 states have a provision that permits some late-arriving ballots to be counted.</p><p>And the order sought to give federal agencies, including the Elon Musk-led team known as the Department of Government Efficiency, access to state voter rolls to check “for consistency with federal requirements.”</p><p>Harrison Fields, a spokesman for the White House, said in a statement that “the Trump administration is standing up for free, fair and honest elections.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The Democrats continue to show their disdain for the Constitution and it continues to show in their insane objections to the president’s common-sense executive actions to require proof of U.S. citizenship in an effort to protect the integrity of American elections,” Mr. Fields said.</p><p>The executive order directs the Elections Assistance Commission, a federal agency that Congress created in 2002 to help election officials with their work, to enforce the proof-of-citizenship requirement.</p><p>But the lawsuit says this is also unlawful, as Congress “intended for the agency to be an ‘independent entity.’”</p><p>“President Trump’s order shreds this congressional design,” the lawsuit states.</p><p>The executive order, as it stands now, could widely disenfranchise voters. About 21.3 million people do not have proof of citizenship readily available, according to <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/millions-americans-dont-have-documents-proving-their-citizenship-readily" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 2023 study by the Brennan Center for Justice</a>, a voting rights and democracy group, and the University of Maryland. And tens of thousands of ballots put in the mail before Election Day still arrive late. In Washington State, which votes nearly universally by mail, more than 250,000 ballots postmarked on time arrived after Election Day in the 2024 presidential election, according to data <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/about-office/news/2025/secretary-state-steve-hobbs-statement-reacting-presidential-executive-order-elections" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from the secretary of state’s office</a>.</p><p>Regarding the ballot deadline provision in the order, the lawsuit argues that Congress has “repeatedly demonstrated its understanding that ballot receipt deadlines are a question of state, not federal, law.” It also cites the Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term, as having agreed that allowing absentee ballots sent by Election Day and received later “is a longstanding ‘policy choice’ reserved to the states.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The lawsuit also cites the possibility of mass disenfranchisement.</p><p>“None of the relevant conditions advances the general welfare,” the lawsuit states. “Each condition will foreseeably disenfranchise eligible electors, which is incompatible with representative democracy.”</p><p>The lawsuit was brought on behalf of the Democratic National Committee along with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the Democratic Governors Association, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.</p><p>In a lengthy memo announcing the lawsuit, the committees, Mr. Schumer and Mr. Jeffries released a joint statement.</p><p>“This executive order is an unconstitutional power grab from Donald Trump that attacks vote by mail, gives DOGE sensitive personal information and makes it harder for states to run their own free and fair elections,” they said. “Donald Trump and DOGE are doing this as an attempt to rationalize their repeatedly debunked conspiracy theories and set the groundwork to throw out legal votes and ignore election outcomes they do not like.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Targeting Federal Agencies:</strong> The so-called Department of Government Efficiency, led by billionaire Elon Musk, has appeared at agency after agency to slash spending and cut the federal work force. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/27/us/politics/doge-playbook-musk-cuts.html">Here’s how DOGE employees do it</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.A.I.D.:</strong> The Trump administration detailed its plans to put the government’s main agency for distributing foreign aid fully under the State Department and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/usaid-trump-doge-cuts.html">reduce its staff to some 15 legally required positions</a>.
