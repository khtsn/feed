    <h1>Art Adviser. Friend. Thief.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Lisa Schiff sat at her kitchen table, trying to explain how she went from being one of the world’s most celebrated art advisers to a high-society pariah and a felon.</p><p>It was her first time speaking openly about her crimes. But the setting for this unburdening wasn’t her old $25,000-a-month TriBeCa loft, or the V. I.P. lounge at Art Basel Miami Beach where she once brokered art deals for the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio; rather, it was a two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan’s unfussy Stuyvesant Town, where, she said, she needs her parents to pay her rent. Ms. Schiff, 55, has lost her money, all her friends and every shred of influence.</p><p>“You become the lie,” Ms. Schiff said, fidgeting with a light-up Lego Christmas tree in her hands. Where once she collected artworks by Nan Goldin and Damien Hirst, today snapshots of her 12-year-old son decorate the apartment. “And I didn’t have anyone to talk to because everyone around me was either paid to be there or was family.”</p><p>While her clients and friends saw a successful woman at the top of her career, she hid a secret. She was stealing from them. To conceal her theft, she would do things like pay one client with another’s money, or leverage their friendships to keep them believing that late payments were always almost on their way.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>By the time it all came crashing down in 2023, she had stolen some $6.4 million, from at least a dozen people.</p><p>But out of all her transgressions, she seemed most ashamed of the glamour that gilded her crimes. Darting around in chartered helicopters and regularly burning through tens of thousands of dollars in shopping sprees at luxury stores, she said, like Loewe in Paris, wasn’t even fun.</p><p>“I was miserable in that helicopter. I was miserable in Loewe in my fancy outfit,” she said, bitter with herself about her own choices. “At the end, I thought that I was going to have a stroke.”</p><p>Today, clients who once jetted around the world with her buying art will speak of her only through a lawyer, Wendy Lindstrom, who represents seven of the people now suing her.</p><p>“Any attempt by Lisa Schiff to portray herself as remorseful is disingenuous at best,” Ms. Lindstrom said in an email.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><h2 id="link-54559f46">An Art-World Ponzi Scheme</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/19/multimedia/00lisa-schiff-cfvh/00lisa-schiff-cfvh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/19/multimedia/00lisa-schiff-cfvh/00lisa-schiff-cfvh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/19/multimedia/00lisa-schiff-cfvh/00lisa-schiff-cfvh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A group of people, some holding drinks, celebrate with Ms. Schiff as she holds court at a party at her company’s headquarters." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/19/multimedia/00lisa-schiff-cfvh/00lisa-schiff-cfvh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/19/multimedia/00lisa-schiff-cfvh/00lisa-schiff-cfvh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/19/multimedia/00lisa-schiff-cfvh/00lisa-schiff-cfvh-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/19/multimedia/00lisa-schiff-cfvh/00lisa-schiff-cfvh-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/a5113691-84a5-5daa-8d08-63da3ebb95e5" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Over her decades-long career, Ms. Schiff helped advance the field of advising from the vanity project of bored socialites into a respected profession, more akin to an asset management firm.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sylvain Gaboury/Patrick McMullan, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>As an art adviser, Ms. Schiff was matchmaker between famous clients and the pricey paintings they wanted above their sofas. Behind the velvet ropes of art fairs, celebrities and art-world insiders alike sought her guidance on which pieces of art to buy with their millions. She was paid a commission for successful transactions.</p><p>They had good reason: Over her decades-long career, Ms. Schiff helped advance the field of advising from the vanity project of bored socialites into a respected profession, more akin to an asset management firm. Schmoozing at cocktail parties and lecturing clients as an ethics authority, she seemed like the ideal art guru: getting access to hot artists before their paintings jumped in value; discreetly brokering sales with the major auction houses; and warding off predatory dealers looking to upsell and overcharge novice collectors. </p><p>She was everywhere, quoted in newspaper pages and speaking at museums. But all last year, she was missing from the cocktail circuit, and absent from the auction floors, except in the fine print: Listed atop three lots in a November auction at Phillips were the words, “Property to be sold to benefit the creditors of Lisa Schiff.”</p><p>That was because in October, Ms. Schiff had pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to defrauding the very clients she called friends. The proceeds of the sale would all go to pay back what she stole not just from clients but from an artist, a gallery and others.</p><p>The crime, which federal prosecutors have described in essence as an art-world Ponzi scheme, began in 2018 and involved some 55 artworks. Sometimes Ms. Schiff would directly siphon money to herself from the sale of her clients’ art; other times, as a go-between for a seller and client, she pocketed the money they gave her to make new purchases on their behalf, and never bought the art at all.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ms. Schiff is scheduled to be sentenced March 19 and faces up to 20 years in prison.</p><p>“Lisa Schiff attempted to paint a picture of a successful fine art advisory business,” James E. Dennehy, assistant director in charge of the F.B.I.’s New York field office, said at her guilty plea. “It was actually a multimillion-dollar fraudulent scheme. After half a decade of deceit, Ms. Schiff will now be held accountable for her lies.”</p><p>Her scheme ensnared clients who were far from art-world rookies. Under her direction, the real-estate heir Candace Barasch had become one of the art world’s top collectors, according to the <a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-collectors/top-200-profiles/candace-carmel-barasch/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">magazine ARTnews</a>. Another client was the veteran dealer <a href="https://observer.com/2024/09/museums-magazzino-italian-art-new-leadership-team/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Adam Sheffer,</a> who once worked at top galleries like Mary Boone and Pace. He was a leader in the art market, even serving as an <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/dealer-schiffs-alleged-ponzi-scheme-2309223" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expert witness</a> in another <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/23/arts/inigo-philbrick-art-dealer-sentenced-prison.html" title="">art fraud case</a>, where he criticized the industry’s lack of due diligence.</p><p>For clients like them, she negotiated multimillion-dollar art purchases with noted dealers such as Larry Gagosian and David Zwirner as well as the major auction houses.</p><p>Today, Ms. Schiff is bankrupt, and her own art collection is being liquidated. Some of those who are suing her say they treated her like a member of the family, only to find they had been robbed.</p><h2 id="link-501c51bd">‘I Can’t Be a Criminal’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The crime, which federal prosecutors have described in essence as an art-world Ponzi scheme, began in 2018 and involved some 55 artworks.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The art Ms. Schiff grew up around in the early ’70s was limited to renditions of Depression-era photographs painted by her mother, which hung in their home in Kendall, Fla. The daughter of a prominent professor of medicine, with a center in his name at the University of Miami, Ms. Schiff said she considered her background privileged — not in terms of money, but gravitas.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“We grew up middle class, but rich in prestige and rich in education<em>,” </em>she said<em>.</em></p><p>To illustrate her point, she said that the painful moment of her bankruptcy was when her library of costly art books was confiscated and sold to pay back her creditors. “I was enamored by the idea of knowledge,” she said — before revealing that she had not read most of them.</p><p>Ms. Schiff said she earned art history degrees from the University of Michigan and the University of Miami before embarking on, but not completing, her Ph.D. from the City University of New York Graduate Center. Instead, she joined the circus of the art market, energized by a front-row seat to the deals that shaped the next chapter of art history.</p><p>She assisted at Phillips auction house in the 1990s and later became a director at an Upper East Side gallery, <a href="https://www.edwardtylernahemfineart.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Edward Tyler Nahem Fine Art</a>. She started her own advisory firm in 2002 and gradually became known as an early admirer of artists who would become market darlings, among them Christopher Wool, Glenn Ligon and Matthew Wong. She frequently trumpeted her efforts to secure a Basquiat for Mr. DiCaprio. She said she also hired a P.R. firm to get her into “serious” publications that would raise her profile further.</p><p>In 2013, she helped found the <a href="https://viaartfund.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">VIA Art Fund</a>, which has raised millions of dollars toward artist grants and projects. Today, there is no trace of Ms. Schiff on the organization’s website; according to court filings, Ms. Schiff owes the nonprofit’s first director, Jeanne Hagerty, and her husband, Thomas, nearly $2 million, including $925,000 they claim she never gave them after selling their Georgia O’Keeffe painting “<a href="https://arthur.io/art/georgia-okeeffe/blue-and-white-abstraction" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Blue and White Abstraction</a>.” In her interview with The Times, Ms. Schiff described the Hagertys as her dearest friends and godparents to her son. They did not respond to several calls for comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In her role as an art adviser, Ms. Schiff hobnobbed with collectors like Swizz Beatz, the hip-hop producer who is married to Alicia Keys.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Stephen Lovekin/Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>She was still jetting between art fairs in 2020, when things began to truly fall apart. Ms. Schiff checked herself into a San Francisco rehab center to combat what she said was an addiction to alcohol and reckless behavior. It was, she said, an attempt to stop stealing and figure out how to make her clients whole. But as soon as she was discharged, she said, with the mid-pandemic art market heating up, she went right back to living large off her clients’ money.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“I was a fake, a fraud every day,” Ms. Schiff said. “I hated when people would say nice things about me; when young people would say: ‘Oh my God, you are Lisa Schiff, you’re such a good art adviser!’” She added: “I felt like a walking corpse.”</p><p>As the threat of incarceration bore down, she fretted about the impact on her young son, whom she raises alone.</p><p>And still, she never stopped. “It just got so big and I got so scared. I have a kid and I was just like, ‘I can’t be a criminal,’” she said. “I didn’t allow myself to even think that I was doing criminal behavior.”</p><h2 id="link-1bc78fdf">Coming Undone</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Under the direction of Ms. Schiff, right, the real-estate heir Candace Barasch, center, became one of the art world’s top collectors.

After Ms. Barasch, the real-estate heir, built a collection of nearly 600 artworks with her help, she described Ms. Schiff in chummy terms, referring to her as her “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/arts/design/show-us-your-wall.html" title="">partner in crime</a>” in a 2019 article in The New York Times.</p><p>Ms. Schiff, however, may have had another view of such collaborations: “I feel like advising is just my way to buy things that I wish I could buy myself,” she confided in a <a href="https://read.dmtmag.com/i/518559-june-july-2015/181?" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2015 interview</a> in Cultured magazine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The two women spoke multiple times a day, according to a complaint Ms. Barasch and her husband, Michael, filed in New York State Supreme Court in 2023. They accused Ms. Schiff of making off with nearly $2 million of the $2.5 million from the sale of a painting owned by the couple and their friend Mr. Sheffer, by the Romanian artist Adrian Ghenie. Schiff Fine Art Advisory, her company, would directly handle her clients’ money in art transactions rather than letting buyers and sellers settle up themselves. She took advantage of the access to their cash.</p><p>Clients were unaware of her schemes for years, though Ms. Barasch noted in court documents that Ms. Schiff’s spending on herself sometimes took her aback; she was struck when Ms. Schiff ran up a bill of $32,000 at Loewe in Paris, for things like $573 leggings and $953 jeans.</p><p>Ms. Schiff said the spending was an effort to keep up with her high-rolling clients. “Did I need to stay in the same hotel as them or fly business?” she said. “No, but I felt like I had more mojo and confidence waking up in the same place as they did.” She said she now understands she was “misguided.”</p><p>Ms. Schiff’s career imploded on a morning in May 2023 on a TriBeCa sidewalk, in a meeting with Mr. Sheffer. The two friends had met to preview the season’s contemporary art auctions. Mr. Sheffer and Ms. Barasch were still waiting for the rest of the money from the Ghenie painting she had sold. Ms. Schiff told him point blank: Their $1.8 million was gone.</p><p>Then she turned and fled down White Street.</p><p>“I am sorry and have every intention to make things right,” Ms. Schiff texted Mr. Sheffer later, according to a lawsuit. “I know you will never speak to me again but I will try to make it right regardless.”</p><p>Then she texted Ms. Barasch, who days later would add another suit, accusing her of similar thefts. They included siphoning away $390,000 Ms. Barasch had wired her to pay for a Sarah Lucas sculpture and shorting the same gallery a quarter of a million dollars for a sculpture by Wangechi Mutu, whose work was exhibited on the facade of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>“Know that I love you,” Ms. Schiff wrote.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Alex Glauber, the president of the Association of Professional Art Advisors, said the reality of Ms. Schiff’s situation “was as far from her story as one could imagine.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>But by then Ms. Schiff had already begun the process of turning herself in, according to her lawyer, Randy Zelin. A few days later, she voluntarily turned over dossiers she compiled outlining her theft to the Manhattan district attorney’s office. On Oct. 17 of the next year, Mr. Zelin dropped her off in a taxi at 100 Centre Street, where she surrendered herself for arrest.</p><p>None of the dozens of entities and people listed as creditors of Ms. Schiff in court filings responded personally to requests for comment. Calls to their lawyers were either not returned, or were declined on their behalf.</p><p>Today the art world is reeling over not just her deception, but also the stain Ms. Schiff has left on the largely unregulated business of art advising.</p><p>“She spoke at great lengths about the importance of transparency, about ethical conduct, about mitigating conflicts of interest, which are all the right things to say,” said Alex Glauber, the president of the <a href="https://www.artadvisors.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Association of Professional Art Advisors</a>. “But as the curtain has been pulled back we have seen the reality was as far from her story as one could imagine.”</p><p>In the interview, Ms. Schiff acknowledged how convincing she was at playing the moral art adviser.</p><p>It’s exactly why, she said, “I’m the worst one.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p><h2 id="link-27cec19b">‘A Case Study in What’s Problematic’</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Are You Kidding,” a painting by Richard Prince from Ms. Schiff’s collection, failed to sell at Phillips auction house in November.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Ms. Schiff’s actions continue to reverberate in a relationship-based business where credibility is everything. “The art world is a small group of people that keep socializing with one another in different parts of the world,” said Adam Green, an art adviser, “and that can help you get access to galleries and artworks.”</p><p>The $63 billion art industry is built partly on trust — sometimes to its detriment. There are advisers like Mr. Green, for example, who refuse to manage payment between collectors and galleries. “I found it odd that money was going through Lisa,” he said.</p><p>Ms. Schiff was never asked to join the invitation-only Association of Professional Art Advisors, Mr. Glauber, the president, who is also an adviser himself, said. She did not qualify for membership because she was also a nascent art dealer, which is against the group’s bylaws given the potential conflict of interest it poses.</p><p>“Unfortunately her situation is a case study in what’s problematic with an industry like ours,” he said.</p><p>But even her critics had to admire Ms. Schiff’s aesthetic taste. Her recognition helped lift the careers of major artists like <a href="http://www.richardprince.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Richard Prince</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/08/arts/design/moma-wolfgang-tillmans-review.html" title="">Wolfgang Tillmans</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Indeed, on a brisk day in November, Mr. Glauber was at Phillips auction house in Manhattan, bidding for a client on a photograph of a Fire Island beach by Tillmans — a piece of Ms. Schiff’s collection, on the block to pay back the people she cheated. The criminal connection did not mean a bargain; it went for nearly $36,000 — almost double its presale estimate. Mr. Glauber put down his paddle, outbid.</p><p>But her <a href="https://www.phillips.com/detail/richard-prince/NY010924/331" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1988 painting</a> by Richard Prince went unsold.

When she feels the urge to go on a spending spree, she heads to Blick Art Materials for a handful of stickers and pens.
