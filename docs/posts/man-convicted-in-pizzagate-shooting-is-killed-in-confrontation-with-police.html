Spry of the Kannapolis Police Department <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Kannapolis911/posts/pfbid0VJNe1FbSujNQoWknUZyuy96zsNYuSzioZXUF3jfu3jBJXGNyt1auw4xXYBTnwA9Yl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> on Thursday. When the officer confirmed his suspicion and went to arrest him, Mr. Welch pulled out a handgun and pointed it at the officer, the police said.</p><p>The police officer and a second officer ordered Mr. Welch to put his gun down. When he did not comply, they shot at him, the department said. Mr. Welch died on Monday at a hospital in Charlotte as a result of his injuries. Neither of the officers or any of the other passengers in the car were injured, Chief Spry said.</p><p>Annette Privette Keller, director of communications for the city of Kannapolis, about 30 miles northeast of Charlotte, said that the city believed the man who was killed was the same person who was sentenced to four years in prison for the Pizzagate episode. He shared the same name, place of residence and age.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The shooting at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/technology/fact-check-this-pizzeria-is-not-a-child-trafficking-site.html" title="">Comet Ping Pong</a>, a pizza parlor in Washington came amid a frenzy of false online rumors and accusations during the 2016 presidential campaign that the restaurant was holding children as sex slaves as part of a child-abuse ring led by Hillary Clinton. The conspiracy theory was started after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/us/pizzagate-attack-sentence.html" title="">people misinterpreted emails</a> from the account of John Podesta, the chairman of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, that were released by WikiLeaks.</p><p>On Dec. 4, 2016, Mr. Welch, who went by Maddison, drove six hours from Salisbury to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/technology/fact-check-this-pizzeria-is-not-a-child-trafficking-site.html" title="">Comet Ping Pong</a> in Northwest Washington to investigate the claims.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Welch surrendering to police in 2016 after shooting in a pizza restaurant in Washington.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sathi Soma, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He brought several guns with him and, shortly after he arrived at the restaurant, fired an assault-like AR-15 rifle inside the restaurant. No one was harmed in the shooting and Mr. Welch surrendered to the police. He later pleaded guilty in federal court to gun charges and received a four-year prison term.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/us/edgar-welch-comet-pizza-fake-news.html" title="">The New York Times</a> shortly after the shooting, Mr. Welch admitted that “the intel on this wasn’t 100 percent.” He was described in the article as being soft-spoken and polite, and he mentioned that he liked the outdoors. He also said he did not believe in conspiracy theories, but said the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks needed to be re-examined.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In the interview with The Times, Mr. Welch expressed remorse for his actions.</p><p>“I regret how I handled the situation,” he said.</p><p>On Thursday, a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/terri.t.welch.3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook user</a> named Terri Tadlock Welch who purported to be a parent of Mr. Welch posted that he “had some struggles” in his life but would be remembered for being “the most generous, loving, compassionate soul, full of life &amp; laughter.”</p><p>The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation is continuing to investigate the shooting that resulted in Mr. Welch’s death. The two officers who fired their guns are on administrative leave as part of standard protocol, Chief Spry’s statement said.</p><p>Kirsten Noyes<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
