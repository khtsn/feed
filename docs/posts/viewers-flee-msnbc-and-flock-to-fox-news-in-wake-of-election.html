Trump had named to his new administration. To say the least, she was not a fan of his selections. But it was important to go through them, she said.</p><p>“It is better to be cleareyed about these things and to see them coming,” she said, “than to be in denial or to be surprised by them when they come around.”</p><p>It seems her audience does not agree, at least for the moment.</p><p>“The Rachel Maddow Show,” the liberal network’s highest-rated program, drew 1.3 million viewers on Monday, about a million shy of her October average, according to Nielsen. In a crucial ratings metric — viewers under the age of 54 — it was the least-watched edition of the show since April 2022.</p><p>That performance mirrors much of what has been happening at MSNBC in the week since Mr. Trump’s election win. MSNBC has averaged 550,000 viewers since Election Day, a 39 percent decline compared with the network’s average in October. In prime time, MSNBC’s audience has declined 53 percent, according to the Nielsen data.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The opposite has happened at Fox News, MSNBC’s conservative rival. Fox’s audience in prime time has grown 21 percent since last Wednesday, with an average of 3.3 million viewers, according to Nielsen. Its total day audience has jumped 38 percent.</p><p>As Mr. Trump has turned to some Fox News talent to help fill out his administration, the network’s coverage has been more euphoric than sober. Mr. Trump has named Tom Homan, a Fox News contributor, as his “border czar,” and on Tuesday night said he had selected Pete Hegseth, a co-host of “Fox &amp; Friends Weekend,” as his defense secretary.</p><p>“Wow, that is pretty cool,” said Laura Ingraham, the network’s 7 p.m. anchor, as she learned about Mr. Hegseth’s selection while on the air. “Gosh, we’re going to miss him at Fox, but that’s a gain for the country.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President-elect Donald J. Trump has named a Fox News anchor, Pete Hegseth, second from right, to run the Pentagon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">John Lamparski/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Viewership totals have plummeted or spiked in the immediate aftermath of presidential elections before. MSNBC’s ratings also declined after the 2016 election. And Fox News experienced viewership declines after the 2020 election was called for President Biden. That dip, however, was largely attributed to a backlash against the network from its audience for declaring that Mr. Biden had defeated Mr. Trump in Arizona, a crucial battleground state.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Fox News, of course, would eventually see ratings bounce back, as did MSNBC in 2017.</p><p>“In the wake of the result, people are probably turning to self-care,” said Martin Kaplan, who runs the Norman Lear Center at the University of Southern California. “It’s like post-traumatic stress disorder of some kind. You don’t want to go back to the scene of the explosion right away.”</p><p>CNN, which has struggled with ratings for months, has also had falling viewership since the election. The cable news network has averaged 413,000 viewers since last Wednesday, a 22 percent decline from its October averages. In prime time, its viewership declines stand at 43 percent, Nielsen said. (CNN said millions of people watched the network’s election night coverage via digital channels.)</p><p>But the post-election results are something of a reversal of fortunes for MSNBC, which declined to comment for this article. During prime-time hours on election night, MSNBC scored an audience of six million viewers, besting CNN’s 5.1 million. It was the first time MSNBC had a larger audience on election night since its founding in the 1990s. (Fox News had more than 10 million viewers, easily winning the night.)</p><p>MSNBC also had gains in the run-up to the election. Its audience spiked 18 percent in August, September and October compared with the rest of the year, the network said. It also widened its viewership lead over CNN in recent months. And even with nose-diving ratings over the last week, MSNBC’s audience remains larger than CNN’s.</p><p>MSNBC also saw temporary audience declines after Mr. Biden’s disastrous debate performance this year. The viewership totals rebounded after he dropped out of the race and Vice President Kamala Harris took over the Democratic presidential ticket.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Privately, MSNBC officials expect a similar trend in the coming weeks and months. But the performance does raise questions about whether or not there will be another so-called Trump bump next year. In 2017, MSNBC and CNN experienced huge ratings gains in the frenetic opening months of Mr. Trump’s administration, as did a number of late-night shows that were critical of his presidency.</p><p>Fewer people watch cable and broadcast television now than they did seven years ago. And the jury is still out about whether liberal viewers will be craving “resistance” television in the same way next year.</p><p>“People have been living in maximal consumption of Trump news for the last 10 years, and certainly the last year,” Mr. Kaplan said. “There’s a certain amount of exhaustion involved.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
