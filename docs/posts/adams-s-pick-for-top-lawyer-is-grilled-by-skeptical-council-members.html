Some of them were clearly distasteful to many of the Democratic Council members.</p><p>But council members’ prime objection seemed rooted in why Mr. Adams had settled on Mr. Mastro as his choice for corporation counsel, who would provide legal representation to the city and its agencies and would also represent Mr. Adams in civil litigation.</p><p>The timing would seem to suit the mayor: He was accused in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/23/nyregion/eric-adams-sexual-assault-lawsuit.html" title="">a lawsuit filed last year</a> under New York’s Adult Survivors Act of sexually assaulting a Florida woman three decades ago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Adrienne Adams, the speaker of the City Council, said the corporation counsel “must faithfully represent all of us,” not “prioritize the mayor or any single official” and “have a strong record of championing what the public holds dear, including justice and equity.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The City Council speaker, Adrienne Adams, questioned Mr. Mastro’s history of representing clients who “conflicted with the city’s long-term institutional interests.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor J. Blue for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Adams, who has accused the mayor of trying to usurp the Council’s legislative powers, questioned whether Mr. Mastro was capable of doing that, citing a history of representing clients who “conflicted with the city’s long-term institutional interests.”</p><p>Mr. Mastro, a former federal prosecutor and aide to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, argued forcefully against the aspersions cast against his legal background and ethics.</p><p>“Let me address the real elephant in the room,” Mr. Mastro said. “To those who just say I’ll be the mayor’s lawyer, they don’t know me.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Mastro described his pro bono work for the homeless, people who protested George Floyd’s murder and members of the L.G.B.T. community, saying that it demonstrated how he cares about New Yorkers and their issues. He talked about fighting to loosen mob control of the Fulton Fish Market amid death threats, and said his core obligation was to fight for his clients.</p><p>Asked if the city should represent the mayor in the sexual assault lawsuit filed against him, Mr. Mastro said it “depends” and he couldn’t say “yes or no” before reviewing the matter and “calling it as I see it.”</p><p>During hours of questioning, Mr. Mastro grew frustrated, raising his voice, leaning his head against his hand, begging not to be cut off and throwing his hands in the air.</p><p>Mr. Mastro said that he would have counseled Mr. Adams against his recent and unusual decision to declare a state of emergency in New York City jails to block a law that would have banned solitary confinement. It was a move Ms. Adams described as showing “unique lack of respect” for the Council and the rule of law.</p><p>“If you pass a law or override a veto, that’s the law and I will tell the administration that,” Mr. Mastro said. “At that point, the administration should be going to court, not ignoring the rule. End of story.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But in hours of questioning, the Council members hammered Mr. Mastro for his past work that seemed at odds with the city’s interests: representing the State of New Jersey in its lawsuit against the federal government over congestion pricing.</p><p>Some of Mr. Mastro’s other high-profile clients include Chevron, which he defended over pollution in the Ecuadorean rain forest; and the former New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, during the investigation of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/nyregion/christies-phone-a-missing-piece-in-bridge-case-is-found.html" title="">George Washington Bridge lane closings</a>.</p><p>“There is a question about your moral character,” said Diana Ayala, the deputy speaker of the City Council. “There are questions about tactics.”</p><p>Mr. Mastro said the Council was missing the nuance of many of the cases he worked on and argued that he would revamp the Law Department and help the Council develop cases that would protect the rights of New Yorkers. He repeated that he had been called the “conscience” of the Giuliani administration.</p><p>“I have a long track record,” Mr. Mastro said. “It’s not a few years, its 30-plus years, of standing up for civil rights, constitutional rights and racial justice.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Adams nominated Mr. Mastro in spite of strong opposition from large swaths of the Council, including the Black Latino and Asian Caucus and the Progressive Caucus.</p><p>The mayor decided not to withdraw the nomination, choosing instead to lobby for months on Mr. Mastro’s behalf, an effort that included his nominee’s meeting with many Council members.</p><p>In order to get the job, Mr. Mastro must be approved by a majority of the 51-member Council next month, but the tenor of the hearing suggested that the lobbying effort may have fallen short.</p><p>Mr. Mastro would replace Sylvia O. Hinds-Radix, who left in May after <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/04/23/us-news/nycs-top-lawyer-pushed-out-after-raising-issues-with-city-repping-adams-in-sex-misconduct-suit-sources/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports of legal disagreements</a> with the Adams administration. Muriel Goode-Trufant is serving as the acting corporation counsel.</p><p>During his weekly media availability, Mr. Adams described Mr. Mastro as a “great” New Yorker and lawyer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I think we would all be proud to have him represent the City of New York,” Mr. Adams said. “But that determination goes through the Council.”</p><p>Later on, when asked if the multitude of investigations surrounding his administration necessitated a particularly combative, aggressive lawyer like Mr. Mastro, Mr. Adams said the city needs “a good attorney, no matter what’s going on in an administration.”</p><p>Dana Rubinstein<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
