Key set pieces from the ballet worth thousands of dollars, including the expandable Christmas tree, the grandfather clocks and the throne, as well as a few props the company had used since its very first production, had vanished in moments.</p><p>Now the ballet company is racing against time to replace what was stolen as it prepares for its two shows on Dec. 7 and 8. But what started as a devastating setback has instead turned a spotlight on a community’s Christmas spirit as it has banded together to support the production.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And for Ms. Smith, 61, the show must go on.</p><p>“This is going to happen,” Ms. Smith said in an interview with The New York Times. “It will look different, but it will happen.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The interior of the stolen trailer containing set pieces, props and production equipment.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">June Smith</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The Nutcracker,” the two-act ballet by Tchaikovsky that tells the story of a young girl named Clara whose nutcracker doll comes to life on Christmas Eve, is a holiday staple for professional and amateur production companies worldwide.</p><p>In Canton, it has been more than just an annual tradition for Ms. Smith, whose mother started the Plymouth-Canton Ballet Company in 1984.</p><p>The company, which was created with the mission of joining together students from different studios across the state, now has 80 dancers hailing from 20 local dance studios. Some students come from as far as 40 miles away to attend weekly rehearsals in Canton, a township nestled between Detroit and Ann Arbor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Smith eventually took over as artistic director and led the company as she raised three children, all of whom are still involved in the production.</p><p>She even delivered her youngest child just days before one of the opening nights, and he attended his first performance of the ballet at 5 days old. Now 19, he will play the titular role of the Nutcracker next month.</p><p>Her grandchildren also take the stage in supporting roles.</p><p>“I can’t imagine life without ‘The Nutcracker,’” Ms. Smith said. “And I know my family feels the same.”</p><p>At first, Ms. Smith believed the missing trailer must have been a simple misunderstanding. She called her son-in-law to ask if he had moved it. After a quick back and forth, his message was clear — call the police.</p><p>When she watched the surveillance footage, Ms. Smith felt sick.</p><p>“That is the magic of our show just driving away,” she said.</p><p>But Ms. Smith quickly pivoted to her students and their only rehearsal of the week. By the time it concluded almost eight hours later, she had come up with a plan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The company made a list of what was missing and worked with volunteers to figure out how to rebuild. Several parents volunteered to construct the missing props, some of which grow to over 15 feet tall. An original dancer from their first production of the ballet in 1984 — who now owns her own dance studio — is also lending a backdrop and a throne.</p><p>Within hours, the local news media started calling. And when another parent started a GoFundMe, donations rolled in. To date, they have raised almost $14,000, money that will go toward a new trailer and building supplies.</p><p>“The support is just unbelievable,” Ms. Smith said. “I have no words for the appreciation I have.”</p><p>A spokesman with the Canton Township Police Department said that they were actively investigating the stolen trailer and props, calling it “high priority” for their department. Ms. Smith said that the trailer itself was worth about $15,000 and that the contents would cost about $10,000 to $15,000 to replace.</p><p>But some of the items that had been in the company’s possession since its first performance are irreplaceable, including a gold backdrop made by a family member who has since passed away. Ms. Smith said that many of the stolen items had sentimental value for the company’s alumni who are used to seeing familiar props from their productions still onstage.</p><p>The current students, however, who range in age from 7 to 18, are undeterred. Even after learning of the theft, Ms. Smith said, they remain hopeful and focused on putting on a great show.</p><p>“I’m just so proud of our people,” she said, adding with a laugh, “we’ll make it work.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
