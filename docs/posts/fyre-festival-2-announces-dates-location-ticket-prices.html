World-class hospitality. “Boundary-pushing” excursions by day. Beachside musical performances by night. And exorbitant ticket prices to boot.</p><p>All of that might sound familiar to anyone who followed the well-chronicled saga of the Fyre Festival, an ill-fated musical carnival that, in 2017, was such a spectacular failure that it spawned <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/movies/fyre-reviews.html" title="">dueling documentaries</a> on Netflix and Hulu. Billy McFarland, the festival’s organizer, wound up going to prison for nearly four years after he entered a guilty plea to charges that included wire fraud.</p><p>But Mr. McFarland, 33, a self-described tech entrepreneur, is back — and he is trying the whole thing over again.</p><p>Mr. McFarland announced this week that Fyre Festival 2, replete with all the trappings listed above, is scheduled for May 30 to June 2 on Isla Mujeres, a Mexican island and vacation destination a few miles off the coast from Cancun. More specifically, the event will be staged at “Playa FYRE,” according to <a href="https://www.fyre.mx/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the festival’s website</a> — though the GPS coordinates provided on the festival’s website appear to point to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/21%C2%B012&#39;32.3%22N+86%C2%B043&#39;43.3%22W?sa=X&amp;ved=1t:242&amp;ictx=111" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a landless spot</a> to the west of Isla Mujeres.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Skepticism would not be out of place when it comes to a sequel of an event where everything seemed to go wrong, but people willing to roll the dice can get started immediately, as some tickets are already on sale.</p><h3 id="link-67866ac4"><span>What is planned for the sequel?</span></h3><p>The festival is being advertised as “an electrifying celebration of music, arts, cuisine, comedy, fashion, gaming, sports and treasure hunting — all set in the stunning location of Isla Mujeres, Mexico.”</p><p>But details are otherwise scant, and organizers were not immediately available for comment. No musical artists have been announced, though Mr. McFarland told NBC’s “Today” in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrYWn-sIXLU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview this week</a> that the genres would include electronic, hip-hop, pop and rock.</p><p>“I’m not in charge of booking the talent,” Mr. McFarland added.</p><p>There is much left to plan. The Isla Mujeres municipal government said in a statement that no permits had been requested or approved for the festival.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Billy McFarland organized the original Fyre Festival with, among others, the rapper Ja Rule.

It is for those who seek to rise above, who don’t just want to witness history but aspire to share it.”</p><h3 id="link-866cacb"><span><strong>Doesn’t this sound a lot like the original Fyre Festival?</strong></span></h3><p>It sure does! Back in 2017, the festival was originally billed as an exclusive, musical-themed getaway in the Bahamas — a sort of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/subject/coachella-valley-music-and-arts-festival" title="">Coachella</a> with the splendor of a five-star resort. The event was scheduled for two weekends, in April and May 2017.</p><p>Mr. McFarland, who partnered with the rapper Ja Rule on that venture, said he had booked musical acts like Major Lazer, Migos and Blink-182 to perform for guests who were willing to pay premium prices.</p><p>The event was hyped on social media by celebrities and influencers like Kendall Jenner, Emily Ratajkowski and Bella Hadid. Mr. McFarland called them “Fyre Starters.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Attendees <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/arts/music/fyre-festival-ja-rule-bahamas.html" title="">had been told</a> they would be able to “start each day with morning yoga and guided meditation on the beach,” while also enjoying “massages, henna tattooing, sound healing, chill-out sessions and a festive Bahamian junkanoo parade kicking off each weekend.”</p><p>High-end ticket packages included a $400,000 “Artist’s Palace,” which was said to include four beds, eight V.I.P. tickets and dinner with one of the festival performers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The first Fyre Festival was such a disaster that it inspired two different documentaries.

Their gourmet meals were, in some cases, <a href="https://x.com/trev4president/status/857776562615308288/photo/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cheese sandwiches</a>. The headlining musical acts had all backed out. Thousands of guests were left stranded. Many local businesses lost money, too, after agreeing to contracts with Mr. McFarland for various goods and services. One local restaurant owner reported a loss of more than $50,000, which was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/20/online-fund-unpaid-fyre-festival-staff-raises-tens-of-thousands" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eventually recouped</a> by way of donations to a GoFundMe page.</p><p>And while the festival sold a total of about 8,000 tickets for both weekends, according to a lawsuit, only a few chartered planes made it to Great Exuma Island, where the event was to be staged.</p><p>It was, in other words, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/21/arts/music/fyre-festival-billy-mcfarland-ja-rule-criminal-investigation.html" title="">an unmitigated disaster</a>.</p><p>It turned out that Mr. McFarland and his company had been selling tickets even before a location had been nailed down. Fyre employees later said that higher-ups had concocted some of the festival’s more extravagant elements just to see if people would pay for them. (The Artist’s Palace, for example, was never constructed.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>In a statement, organizers blamed “circumstances out of our control.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h3 id="link-3b2c14c2"><span><strong>Why did Billy McFarland end up in prison?</strong></span></h3><p>Two months after the Fyre Festival collapsed, Mr. McFarland was arrested by federal agents and charged with wire fraud. He later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/arts/music/fyre-festival-organizer-sentenced-fraud.html" title="">entered guilty pleas</a> and was sentenced to six years in prison.</p><p>McFarland had defrauded investors and customers out of $26 million, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/william-mcfarland-sentenced-6-years-prison-manhattan-federal-court-engaging-multiple" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prosecutors said</a>, both for his role in organizing the festival and for launching a sham ticket-selling business while he was out on bail.</p><p>“I probably added years on to my sentence by doing that,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/10/fashion/billy-mcfarland-release.html" title="">Mr. McFarland told The Times</a> after his release from prison in 2022. “I just was making bad decision after bad decision.”</p><h3 id="link-2c23a0b1"><span><strong>Why is Mr. McFarland trying this again?</strong></span></h3><p>Mr. McFarland said <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGdUf2lxOab/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Instagram</a> that many people would think he is “crazy for doing this again.”</p><p>He still owes nearly $26 million to the people he defrauded, and “Today” reported that a portion of the revenue from Fyre Festival 2 <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/fyre-festival-2-dates-location-tickets-rcna193328" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">will go to them</a>. Mr. McFarland also said he was partnering with a Mexico-based events producer, <a href="https://www.lostnights.mx/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lostnights</a>, and established vendors to help the event run smoothly.</p><p>“After years of reflection and now thoughtful planning,” Mr. McFarland said on Instagram, “the new team and I have amazing plans for Fyre 2. The adventure seekers who trust the vision and take the leap will make history. Thank you to my partners for the second chance.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Scott Cacciola writes features and profiles of people in the worlds of sports and entertainment for the Styles section of The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/scott-cacciola">More about Scott Cacciola</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Find the Right Soundtrack for You</h2><h3>Trying to expand your musical horizons?
