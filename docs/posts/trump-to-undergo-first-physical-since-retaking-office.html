    <h1>Trump to Undergo First Physical Since Retaking Office</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2015, his personal physician at the time, Dr. Harold Bornstein, wrote in a note to the news media that Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, had “extraordinary” strength and stamina. Dr. Bornstein told CNN in 2018 that Mr. Trump had personally dictated the letter.</p><p>That year, the White House physician at the time, Dr. Ronny Jackson, said that Mr. Trump had a calcium score of 133, indicating plaque in his arteries but at a level fairly common for a man of his age.</p><p>But the president at times has offered few details about his health. He went for an unexplained visit to Walter Reed in 2019; aides said after his term ended that it was for a colonoscopy. In October 2020, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/us/politics/trump-hospitalized-with-coronavirus.html" title="">Mr. Trump went to Walter Reed</a> as he was battling a far <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/11/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html" title="">more aggressive case of Covid</a> than his advisers had revealed, one that had infiltrated his lungs. Public health officials from his administration later said privately that had Mr. Trump not been given monoclonal antibodies as a treatment, he may not have survived.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s successor and predecessor, President Joseph R. Biden Jr., was previously the oldest man to enter office, also at 78. Mr. Trump, who had a four-year gap between presidencies, was five months and six days older than Mr. Biden was when he was inaugurated.</p><p>Mr. Trump has frequently mocked the age and mental acuity of Mr. Biden, who declined visibly during his term. Mr. Trump was more visible than Mr. Biden during the 2024 campaign and holds some form of an event in front of news cameras multiple days a week. But he has had his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/us/politics/trump-biden-age.html" title="">own verbal stumbles</a>.</p></div></div>
