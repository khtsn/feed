A brown-eared Easter Bunny greeted the crowd, the first lady read a children’s story — and the president and his defense secretary lashed out at the media.</p><p>The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/us/politics/hegseth-yemen-attack-second-signal-chat.html" title="">reported on Sunday</a> that Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon chief, had shared sensitive details about forthcoming military strikes in a second group chat in the Signal app, one that included members of his family and his personal lawyer.</p><p>President Trump and Mr. Hegseth had not responded to the report ahead of the festivities at the White House on Monday morning. So when journalists who had assembled to cover the event tracked down the two to ask about the situation, their responses were a departure from the Easter cheer.</p><p>Mr. Hegseth, wearing an American flag pocket square, appeared furious as he railed at reporters. His children shuffled their feet behind him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“These kids right here,” Mr. Hegseth said, gesturing to them as he looked directly into the lens of a television camera, “this is why we’re fighting the fake news media.”</p><p>He pointed an accusatory finger at the gathered group of journalists: “This group right here — full of hoaxters. You peddle anonymous sources from leakers with axes to grind and then you put it all together as if it’s some news story.”</p><p>He placed an arm around his wife — who was included in the Signal chat in question — and ushered the family away.</p><p>Elsewhere on the lawn, the president could not avoid questions.</p><p>Flanked by the first lady, Melania Trump, and an Easter Bunny in a pale green jacket, Mr. Trump addressed the crowd from a balcony and spoke about Pope Francis, whose death was announced by the Vatican overnight.</p><p>Serenaded by live music from a Marine Corps band, the Trumps descended into the crowd, which included reporters. There, the questions about the Signal chat began.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Why would you even ask a question like that?” Mr. Trump said to one reporter who asked whether he still had confidence in Mr. Hegseth.</p><p>He rejoined his family, including his eldest son and several grandchildren, and the first couple presided over an egg roll.</p><p>“Are you ready?” Mr. Trump asked the gathered children before counting to three and blowing on a gold whistle. But he was quickly distracted again by the journalists assembled behind them.</p><p>“Look at that, look behind you,” he told Mrs. Trump. One young grandson standing next to them also squinted curiously at the reporters. “The best people. They have good days and they have bad days — but we all do, right?”</p><p>Before he turned back to the festivities, he considered making an offering to the journalists.</p><p>“Do you want an egg?” he asked. “We’ll give you a couple of eggs.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aishvarya Kavi works in the Washington bureau of The Times, helping to cover a variety of political and national news.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-department-of-defense">U.S. Department of Defense</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/melania-trump">Melania Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on the Signal Leak</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>What the Leak Revealed:</strong> Our reporters discuss what the Signal chat leak revealed about the Trump administration and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/29/us/politics/signal-leak-waltz-hegseth.html">the state of politics in Washington</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Angering U.S. Military Pilots:</strong> Men and women who have taken to the air on behalf of the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/us/politics/pilots-signal-leak.html">expressed bewilderment</a> after the leak of attack plans.</p></li><li><p><strong>Voters Weigh In:</strong> The New York Times asked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/29/us/trump-signal-leak-war-plans.html">five voters what they thought of the administration’s response</a> to the revelation that top national security officials discussed plans for U.S. strikes in Yemen on Houthi militants over Signal, a commercial messaging app.</p></li><li><p><strong>Intelligence Officials Face Questions:</strong> Members of President Trump’s cabinet insisted at a House committee hearing that there was nothing wrong with using a consumer messaging app to discuss U.S. military plans.
