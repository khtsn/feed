A new medium-size electric pickup is expected in 2027 as well, the company said.</p><p>“The competitive nature of the market is changing globally,” Ford’s chief financial officer, John Lawler, said in a conference call. “That means these vehicles need to be profitable, and if not, we will pivot and adjust and make those tough decisions.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Lawler said investments in electric vehicles would now account for about 30 percent of the company’s capital budget, down from 40 percent. The company will take a charge of $400 million to account for the cost of manufacturing equipment it purchased for the production of the canceled electric S.U.V., and it may have up to $1.5 billion in additional expenses related to the project.</p><p>“This is certainly not great news in terms of Ford’s progress on E.V.s,” said Sam Abuelsamid, a principal research analyst at Guidehouse Insights, a research firm. “Clearly they have not yet come to grips with cost-reduced E.V.s and getting more affordable products on the market.”</p><p>Ford’s shift comes as the rate of growth in electric vehicle sales has slowed significantly in the United States and Europe, prompting Tesla and other automakers to cut prices. Last month, Ford reported that its electric vehicle division had lost $2.5 billion in the first half of the year before certain expenses were taken into account. The company overall made $3.2 billion.</p><p>Nearly 600,000 electric cars and trucks were sold in the United States in the first six months of the year. That represented an increase of 7 percent from the same period a year ago, a significant slowdown. In 2023, sales increased 46 percent.</p><p>After initially showing enthusiasm for electric models, some consumers have shied away from such cars over the past year over concerns about higher prices and the challenges of charging them. Some of those reluctant buyers have turned to hybrid models, which use batteries, electric motors and gasoline engines, and sales of those vehicles have surged in recent months.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Other manufacturers are also running into difficulties. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/business/volkswagen-rivian-vw-investment.html" title="">Volkswagen recently partnered with Rivian</a>, a start-up, in an effort to hasten development of electric models and reduce costs. Volkswagen’s U.S. electric vehicle sales fell 28 percent in the first half of the year, to just under 12,000 vehicles.</p><p>Like Ford, General Motors has also slowed the pace of work on new battery plants and delayed the introduction of some electric models. G.M. has been losing money on its electric models but has said it expects them to become profitable by the end of this year.</p><p>Just a few years ago, Ford hoped to have the capacity to make as many as two million electric vehicles a year by 2026, a target it abandoned last year. The company sells three electric models in the United States: the F-150 Lightning pickup, the Mustang Mach-E S.U.V. and the E-Transit van.</p><p>Sales of the F-150 Lightning have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/07/business/fords-f150-lightning-electric-pickup-trucks.html" title="">fallen short of expectations</a>, and Ford recently cut production of the vehicle to one shift per day from two.</p><p>The automaker has three battery plants under construction: one each in Kentucky, Tennessee and Michigan. The Kentucky plant is scheduled to begin production next year, Ford said. The company has suspended construction of a fourth that had been planned for Kentucky. Ford said its Tennessee plant would supply battery packs for a new electric delivery van to be assembled at a plant in Ohio in 2026, and for a new large electric pickup truck that is still in development. The pickup will be built at a new assembly plant that is under construction at the same site as the Tennessee battery plant.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The medium-size pickup truck is the product of a separate team that Ford set up in California to develop more affordable electric vehicles.</p><p>Instead of building a large electric S.U.V., Ford plans to produce a hybrid model with three rows of seating.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Neal E.
