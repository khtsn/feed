Tariffs would deal the province a deeply painful blow, including significant job losses.</p><p>Before Thursday’s vote, <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/doug-ford-clear-winner-ontario-leadership-debate" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">polls</a> had consistently shown Mr. Ford’s political opponents — Bonnie Crombie of the Liberal Party, and Marit Stiles of the New Democratic Party, whose policies put her to the left of the Liberals — trailing him by double digits.</p><p>“What’s happening south of the border is occupying more of people’s attention maybe than what’s happening in Ontario,” contributing to a “slightly uninteresting election,” said Daniel Rubenson, a political science professor at Toronto Metropolitan University.</p><p>Further sapping some of the drama, the three candidates tended to agree on the main issues, said John Beebe, founder of the same university’s Democratic Engagement Exchange, an organization focused on voter participation. This accord on policy included the need to increase the number of family doctors, build up transit networks and lower costs for developers to build houses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“There’s broad consensus about what the issues are and I think it makes it really hard for the average voter to say, ‘OK, who has the better plan?’,” Mr. Beebe said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Ford campaign bus at a stop in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Carlos Osorio/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Even though Mr. Ford’s party already commanded a majority of seats in the provincial legislature, Mr. Ford called an early election — more than a year before its scheduled date in June 2026 — because he said the party needed “a strong mandate” from voters to fight Mr. Trump’s tariffs. </p><p>Mr. Ford’s opponents questioned the timing of Thursday’s election, noting that if tariffs were imposed, they would support additional spending to help Ontarians cope with any economic pain caused by the levies, rendering an early election unnecessary.</p><p>They also pointed out that the federal government would be the main negotiating party with Mr. Trump’s administration, not Ontario, though Mr. Ford could take some retaliatory measures on his own.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The tariffs could cost Ontario as many as 500,000 jobs, Mr. Ford said, particularly in the province’s auto industry, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/world/americas/trump-tariffs-windsor-canada.html" title="">production is so intertwined with the United States</a> that car parts can cross the border multiple times a day during assembly.</p><p>Mr. Trump said he plans to apply 25 percent tariffs on Canadian exports unless Canada strengthens its border security. Mr. Trump and Canada agreed to a 30-day reprieve, which is set to expire on Tuesday, after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau agreed to adopt various steps to fortify the border.</p><p>“At this crucial time, we must work together to defend Canadian interests, protect workers and businesses, and grow our economy,” Mr. Trudeau said in a statement congratulating Mr. Ford.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Ford regularly appears at news conferences wearing a baseball cap that says “Canada Is Not For Sale.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Justin Tang/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Mr. Ford was first elected in 2018, winning a majority government after 15 years of Liberal Party rule. He had run on a platform that focused on lowering taxes and developing industries, like mining in the northern part of the province.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The son of a businessman who was also a provincial politician, he rose through party politics by marketing himself as an anti-establishment candidate, and during his first premiership campaign he drew comparisons to Mr. Trump.</p><p>Before becoming Ontario’s leader, Mr. Ford served as a city councilor in Toronto, where his brother, Rob Ford, was the mayor who attracted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/23/world/americas/rob-ford-dies.html" title="">international notoriety</a> after he confessed to using crack cocaine. He died in 2016.</p><p>Some critics have questioned Mr. Ford’s close relationship with developers.</p><p>A plan to open up a protected area of farmland, forest and wetlands around Toronto, known as <a href="https://www.greenbelt.ca" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the greenbelt</a>, to development is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/12/world/canada/ontario-auditor-greenbelt-developers.html" title="">under investigation</a> by provincial police.</p><p>But with his victory Thursday, it seemed clear that his core message had resonated with the province’s voters.</p><p>“This election is about who we are and what we stand for,” Mr. Ford said in a <a href="https://x.com/fordnation/status/1892324841719538091" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">campaign ad</a>, denouncing Mr. Trump’s threats to annex Canada. “So let me be clear: Canada will never be the 51st state.
