Kathy Hochul of New York announced on Thursday that she would not exercise her authority to remove Mayor Eric Adams from office for now, but would seek to impose strict new guardrails on his administration of New York City.</p><p>While Ms. Hochul’s actions, if enacted by state and city legislators, would fall far short of the removal some have demanded, they would curtail Mr. Adams’s independence as he battles accusations that he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/nyregion/adams-prosecutor-danielle-sassoon-profile.html" title="">entered a corrupt agreement</a> with the Trump administration to drop federal bribery charges against him.</p><p>In remarks at her Manhattan office, Ms. Hochul said she understood why New Yorkers were outraged by the actions of Mr. Adams, a fellow Democrat she has considered an ally for years. She framed her approach as part of a broader fight to protect the city from President Trump’s influence.</p><p>“The Trump administration is already trying to use the legal jeopardy facing our mayor to squeeze and weaken our city,” Ms. Hochul said. “I call it the Trump revenge tour, and I have to stand in its way.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The governor then laid out a suite of new oversight measures designed to empower other state and city officials to keep careful watch over Mr. Adams’s team at City Hall and potentially challenge Mr. Trump if the mayor would not.</p><p>The proposed changes included creating a new state deputy inspector general focused on New York City’s operations; establishing a fund for the city comptroller, public advocate and City Council speaker to hire outside counsel to sue the federal government if the mayor is unwilling to do so; and granting additional funds for the state’s comptroller to scrutinize city finances.</p><p>The governor said she also wanted a legal change to bar the mayor from firing the head of the city’s Department of Investigation without the approval of the state inspector general. The agency worked closely with the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors to build their case against Mr. Adams.</p><p>Ms. Hochul said she had spoken to leaders of the City Council and the State Legislature and made clear she intended for the special provisions to expire at the end of 2025, when Mr. Adams’s first term expires, with the potential for renewal. She called them “a first start in restoring trust” but urged Mr. Adams to take his own steps to regain the city’s confidence.</p><p>In a statement, the mayor said “there is no legal basis for limiting New Yorkers’ power by limiting the authority of my office,” but indicated that he might not fight Ms. Hochul.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“I have told the governor, as we have done in the past, that I am willing to work with her to ensure faith in our government is strong,” Mr. Adams said. <em>“</em>I look forward to continuing those conversations.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>New York City Mayor Eric Adams in the Bronx on Thursday. He has insisted he will not resign.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The announcement was the result of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/nyregion/hochul-adams-removal.html" title="">days of deliberations by Ms. Hochul</a> over how to handle the conundrum of Mr. Adams’s situation. Growing numbers of fellow Democrats have called for his resignation or for her to use her constitutional authority to remove him from office.</p><p>No governor in New York’s 235-year history has removed a mayor whom the voters elected, and Ms. Hochul made it clear she had grave concerns about the precedent that could be set by doing so now. Mr. Adams has insisted he will not quit voluntarily.</p><p>“My strong belief is that the will of the voters and the supremacy and sanctity of democratic elections preclude me from any other action at this time,” Ms. Hochul said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>She was referring to the city’s regularly scheduled mayoral election later this year, when Mr. Adams is expected to be on the ballot.</p><p>Ms. Hochul also said she had concerns that beginning removal proceedings would bring additional “disruption and chaos.” Though she said she could revisit her decision if facts changed, the governor declined to say whether she believed the mayor should resign.</p><p>It remained to be seen whether the governor’s approach would placate those who fear Mr. Adams has been compromised into doing Mr. Trump’s bidding — or if she could persuade fellow Democrats to enact them.</p><p>Many of Ms. Hochul’s proposals would require approval from city and state lawmakers. That could well set off a fight with Mr. Adams’s allies in Albany, or with lawmakers wary of letting the state take a greater role than it already has in the city’s affairs.</p><p>New York City and the state have been engaged a long-running power struggle, typified by regular disputes over the mayor’s ability to control the city’s school system. Within minutes of Ms. Hochul’s plans becoming public, Democratic state lawmakers began privately complaining that she was trying to make substantial changes to that balance of power without consulting them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, the Brooklyn Democratic chairwoman and an ally of Mr. Adams, said she was glad that Ms. Hochul would not try to remove the mayor. Yet she viewed the governor’s proposal to limit his powers as “a big overstep” and said it had a “bit of a racial tone,” referring to the appearance of a white governor acting against the city’s second Black mayor.</p><p>“For our governor who I love dearly to come out with this plan for overtaking New York City is worthy of concern of many legislators,” she said.</p><p>Questions around Mr. Adams’s independence have been growing for months as he sought to curry favor with Mr. Trump and maneuvered for a pardon from his charges. Federal prosecutors had accused him of accepting more than $100,000 in flight upgrades and airline tickets as part of his relationship with Turkish officials.</p><p>The mayor’s attempt to rid himself of the charges came to a head last week, after the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/10/nyregion/eric-adams-charges#703ff5bd-2b28-5560-9f69-9bb404673137" title="">said it intended to dismiss the indictment</a> and forgo a trial to allow Mr. Adams greater ability to help implement Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda.</p><p>The mayor, who insisted he was innocent of the charges, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/nyregion/eric-adams-nyc-mayor-case.html" title="">swore under oath</a> in court on Wednesday that he had not entered into any sort of agreement with the Justice Department to drop the case. Department officials have made similar statements.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But the prosecutor who was overseeing the mayor’s case has asserted just the opposite: that Mr. Trump’s appointees at the Justice Department and Mr. Adams entered into a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/nyregion/danielle-sassoon-quit-eric-adams.html" title="">quid pro quo</a>. Those accusations have disturbed New York Democrats. So have the terms of the deal, which would let the department resurrect the charges at its discretion and could create leverage over Mr. Adams.</p><p>A judge is still considering whether to approve the motion to dismiss the case.</p><p>Other leaders of the city have not waited to act. Four deputy mayors announced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/nyregion/adams-deputy-mayors-resign-trump-immigration.html" title="">their resignations</a> on Monday over Mr. Adams’s cooperation with Mr. Trump.</p><p>The city comptroller, Brad Lander, has threatened to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/nyregion/adrienne-adams-mayor-resign.html" title="">convene a committee</a> to remove Mr. Adams on the basis of his inability to govern unless the mayor quickly released a “detailed contingency plan” outlining how he would manage the city. (Adrienne Adams, the City Council speaker who would serve on the committee, cast doubt on that path, however.)</p><p>Mr. Lander, who is also running against Mr. Adams for mayor, and another prospective member of the inability committee, the Queens borough president, Donovan Richards, both praised Ms. Hochul’s intervention.</p><p>“While the best solution to restore public trust would be for Mayor Adams to resign and to keep the four deputy mayors in place instead, Governor Hochul’s new guardrails are useful to keep New York City moving forward in these precarious times,” Mr. Lander said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Richards said Ms. Hochul had “shown tremendous leadership and maintained an open mind throughout this difficult process.”</p><p>The leaders of the City Council, State Assembly and State Senate — whose support will be critical for the governor’s proposals to move forward — did not immediately comment.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
