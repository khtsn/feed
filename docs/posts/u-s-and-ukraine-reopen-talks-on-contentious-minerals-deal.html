The White House has not provided details on the talks.</p><p>Here’s what to know on the negotiations.</p><h2 id="link-58be5090">What’s the Latest U.S. Proposal?</h2><p>The new proposal, reviewed by The New York Times, reverts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html" title="">Mr. Trump’s initial demand that Ukraine repay the United States</a> for the billions it has received in military and financial aid since Russia’s invasion three years ago.</p><p>As in earlier proposals, Ukraine would have to contribute half its revenue from natural resource projects — including critical minerals, oil and gas, as well as related infrastructure such as ports and pipelines — to a U.S.-controlled investment fund. Profits from the fund would be reinvested in Ukrainian natural resource projects, though the exact share of such profit remained unclear.</p><p>The new draft also echoes earlier versions by omitting any mention of security guarantees for Ukraine, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/world/europe/us-ukraine-minerals-deal-security.html" title="">provision that Kyiv had long pressed for and managed to include in a draft</a> last month — but one that Washington had long resisted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Inhulska uranium mine, visible from an apartment building last month in Pervozvanivka, Ukraine, southeast of Kyiv.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-32966cd4">Tougher Demands</h2><p>The new proposal includes stricter terms than earlier drafts: Washington would claim all profit from the fund until Kyiv repaid at least the equivalent of the U.S. aid received during the war plus 4 percent annual interest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The United States also would retain a “right of first offer” on new projects and the power to veto sales of Ukrainian resources to third countries. And in the first year of the agreement, Ukraine would be prohibited from offering any investment projects to third parties with better financial or economic terms than those offered to the United States.</p><p>The fund would be controlled by the International Development Finance Corporation, a U.S. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/business/usaid-dfc-ben-black.html" title="">government agency responsible for investing in companies and projects abroad</a>. The agency would nominate three board members — while Ukraine would have only two — and would oversee each project where earnings from the fund are invested.</p><h2 id="link-439c63bd">Why Is Trump Reviving Tough Terms?</h2><p>The United States opened the negotiations in February with tough financial demands that Mr. Zelensky <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/world/europe/ukraine-trump-mineral-deal.html" title="">warned would take “generations of Ukrainians” to repay</a>.</p><p>After intense talks, Kyiv managed to soften some of Washington’s toughest demands and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/world/europe/ukraine-minerals-deal.html" title="">reached an agreement that it considered more acceptable</a>. But the deal collapsed after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/world/europe/zelensky-trump-ukraine.html" title="">disastrous Oval Office meeting</a> between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The debacle prompted the U.S. to briefly suspend military aid to Ukraine. Since then, Kyiv has treaded carefully to avoid angering the White House.</p><p>Now, demands that Kyiv had previously succeeded in removing — that Washington retains control of the fund and that Ukraine repays past U.S. aid — have resurfaced in the latest proposal. The security guarantees also disappeared.</p><p>Officials in Kyiv say they consider the new demands to be an opening bid for further negotiations.</p><p>Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said any future agreement should be mutually beneficial, and should not jeopardize Ukraine’s accession to the European Union by granting preferential treatment to U.S. businesses. “This is a key principle for the Ukrainian side,” Mr. Sybiha <a href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/3979879-ukraine-already-developed-position-on-minerals-agreement-sybiha.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> this week.</p><p>Still, Ukrainian officials have not rejected the new American demands outright, mindful that the past refusals strained U.S.-Ukraine relations. Instead, they have framed the new round of talks as constructive discussions.</p><p>“This dialogue reflects the strategic interests of both nations and our shared commitment to building a strong, transparent partnership,” Yulia Svyrydenko, the Ukrainian economy minister, <a href="https://x.com/Svyrydenko_Y/status/1909175482546782681" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on Monday.</p><p>Kyiv is seeking consulting services to advise on the minerals deal and “protect Ukraine’s national interests.” A <a href="https://www.kmu.gov.ua/npas/pro-vydilennia-koshtiv-z-rezervnoho-fondu-derzhavnoho-s316080425" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">government order</a> published on Tuesday stated that $2.7 million had been allocated for hiring consultants with experience in public debt management and lawyers.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Black Sea Cease-Fire: </strong>Ukrainian Navy officers and business owners in Odesa, a port city, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/world/europe/ukraine-russia-black-sea-truce.html">pondered what Kyiv could gain from a truce</a> after it pushed back Russian vessels and resumed commercial shipping.</p></li><li><p><strong>Toys Memorialize the Dead</strong>: A Russian missile that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/europe/ukraine-kryvyi-ri-attack.html">struck near a playground</a> in central Ukraine and killed children was a painful reminder of a relentless war more than three years on.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prince Harry Visits Ukraine: </strong>The younger son of King Charles III <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/world/europe/prince-harry-ukraine-visit.html">toured a rehabilitation facility in Lviv</a> for soldiers and civilians wounded in the war.</p></li><li><p><strong>P.O.W.s in Russia: </strong>Live drone footage allows <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/europe/russia-ukraine-pow-executions.html">Ukraine to observe what it views as war crimes</a> unfold in real time, soldiers say.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Partnership: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/29/world/europe/us-ukraine-military-war-wiesbaden.html">The untold story</a> of America’s hidden role in Ukrainian military operations against Russia’s invading armies.</p></li><li><p><strong>An Uneasy Discord:</strong> The split between Europe and the United States over how to end the war is exposing a new, disorienting reality for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/europe/trump-europe-ukraine-russia.html">an alliance in trouble</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>L.G.B.T.Q.
