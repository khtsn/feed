President Vladimir V. Putin had signaled in a Dec. 19 news conference that the agreement would not be extended. “That’s fine — we will survive, Gazprom will survive,” he said.</p><p>Because the expiration of the deal was long anticipated and prepared for by European countries, it was not expected to have a substantial effect on prices, analysts said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The headquarters of Gazprom in St. Petersburg, Russia.

In response, most European Union member states reduced their reliance on Russian gas, although three countries — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/business/energy-environment/austria-natural-gas-russia.html" title="">Austria</a>, Hungary and Slovakia — continued to buy large amounts of energy from Russia.</p><p>The Austrian government said in a <a href="https://x.com/lgewessler/status/1874359218037502083" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> Wednesday that it had prepared in advance and found suppliers outside Russia. “We did our homework and were well prepared for this scenario,” said Leonore Gewessler, Austria’s energy minister, on social media.</p><p>While Hungary had pushed for the Ukrainian pipeline to remain open, it receives most of its Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline, which runs from Russia under the Black Sea to Turkey.</p><p>Slovakia, whose prime minister, Robert Fico, is friendly with Mr. Putin, is heavily reliant on Russian gas, but its economy minister said in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/slovakia-not-facing-gas-shortage-after-ukraine-transit-deal-expires-ministry-2024-12-31/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement Tuesday</a> that it would not face shortages because of gas in storage facilities and alternative supplies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Fico, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/world/europe/slovak-leader-visits-putin.html" title="">who traveled to Moscow last month for talks with Mr. Putin focused on gas,</a> had threatened to cut off electricity supplies in retaliation against Ukraine if it did not extend the transit deal.

In December it declared a state of emergency amid fears that the end of Russian gas traveling through Ukraine would endanger its main source of electricity, a gas-fueled power plant in the breakaway Russian-speaking region of Transnistria.</p><p>Gazprom warned Moldova this week that it would halt all gas deliveries on Jan. 1 even if the pipeline through Ukraine kept working, citing a long-running dispute over unpaid bills. Immediately hit by the shutdown was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/world/europe/moldova-russia-transnistria.html" title="">Transnistria</a>, a sliver of Moldovan territory next to Ukraine that, with support from Moscow, declared itself an independent microstate after the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p><p>The energy company there told its customers Wednesday that it would stop supplying gas for heating to private houses. The company would provide gas for cooking “until the pressure in the network drops to a critical level,” it said in a statement on Telegram.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>That Russia would risk hurting its own proxies in Transnistria, which has been occupied by Russian troops for more than three decades, is a measure of how the war in Ukraine has altered Moscow’s priorities.</p><p>Ukraine, too, has faced difficult choices. Struggling to withstand relentless Russian assaults both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/world/europe/ukraine-russia-attacks-eastern-front.html" title="">on the front</a> and directed at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/world/europe/ukraine-electricity-winter.html" title="">its energy grid</a>, Kyiv appears to have decided that an opportunity to deliver an economic blow to the Kremlin by reducing its earnings from gas exports outweighed the potential risks.</p><p>“We won’t allow them to earn additional billions off our blood,” Mr. Zelensky said when he announced the decision on Dec. 19 to shut down the pipeline. On Wednesday, he <a href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1874481379326488916" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on social media: “As a result of Russia weaponizing energy and resorting to cynical blackmail of partners, Moscow lost one of the most profitable and geographically accessible markets.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, a man walked his dog by torch light in November amid partial power cuts.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alina Smutko/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>The move “underscores just how much the European political and energy landscape has changed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022,” Bota Iliyas, a senior analyst at Prism, a strategic intelligence firm, said before the shutdown.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Fico’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/world/europe/slovak-leader-visits-putin.html" title="">trip to Moscow</a> earlier in December was a blow to European unity in keeping the Kremlin isolated. As soon as Mr. Fico returned to Slovakia, he threatened to cut Ukraine off from vital energy supplies it needs to sustain its battered power grid. About 19 percent of the electricity Ukraine imports from the Europe Union flows through Slovakia, according to Ukrainian officials.</p><p>Mr. Galushchenko, Ukraine’s energy minister, said that halting electricity supplies to Ukraine would violate European regulations, and Kyiv has issued an appeal to Brussels to block the move. At the same time, Ukraine is negotiating with other European allies, including Poland, to import more power and offset any action Slovakia might take.</p><p>Ukraine has been working to decrease its own dependence on Russia to meet its energy needs and recently announced that it had imported liquefied natural gas from the United States, via Greece, for the first time.</p><p>Mike Ives<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Marc Santora has been reporting from Ukraine since the beginning of the war with Russia. He was previously based in London as an international news editor focused on breaking news events and earlier the bureau chief for East and Central Europe, based in Warsaw.
