You trust that the steady rise and fall of stars heralds order, only to be ambushed by surprise and confusion.</p><p>For the last quarter-century, I have been privileged to ride on a vertiginous wave of awe and terror. Armed with the coolest business card in journalism, identifying me as the “cosmic affairs correspondent” of The New York Times, I descended into the bowels of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/21/science/cern-large-hadron-collider-ar-ul.html" title="">Large Hadron Collider</a> in Geneva, froze on stormy mountaintops in Mexico and drank in glittery star fields on peaks in Chile and Hawaii. I lectured about Albert Einstein in Hong Kong and Berlin and despaired as I wandered the muddy rubble of the World Trade Center after Sept. 11.</p><p>Now, I am retiring from The Times and must relinquish that business card, although not the mission behind it. I will continue to appear in these pages from time to time and work on a book trying to marry the personal and the cosmic.</p><p>This gig provided me with a thrilling vista of history and science. Researchers and the rest of us heard black holes colliding, spreading ripples through the fabric of space-time, and saw them staring like smoke rings from the hearts of galaxies — trap doors into the end of time. After 50 years and $10 billion, physicists finally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/05/science/chasing-the-higgs-boson-how-2-teams-of-rivals-at-CERN-searched-for-physics-most-elusive-particle.html" title="">discovered the Higgs boson</a> (or “God particle”). It was the missing key to physicists’ best, but still unsatisfying, theory of nature yet, called the Standard Model.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Astronomers discovered that there are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/science/cosmic-census-finds-billions-of-planets-that-could-be-like-earth.html" title="">billions of possibly habitable planets</a> in the galaxy. At the same time, they have had to accept that 95 percent of the cosmos consists of invisible “dark matter” that binds stars in galaxies and a “dark energy” that pushes those same galaxies apart ever faster. Nobody knows what this dark stuff is.</p><p>In 2015, when I first heard rumors that the twin antennas of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory had felt the cosmos quaking <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/science/ligo-gravitational-waves-black-holes-einstein.html" title="">from the collision of two black holes</a> deep in space and time, I didn’t believe it. What I knew about LIGO had convinced me that it was an outlandishly ambitious experiment bound to fail.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
