Starting with the Seoul Games of 1988, the Paralympics have been held in the same host city as the Summer Olympics. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/olympic-games-paris-2024" title="">Paris Olympics</a>, under the auspices of the International Olympic Committee, ran from July 26 to Aug. 11.</p><p>But despite their close ties and associations, the I.P.C. and the I.O.C. are distinct organizations with different staff, different bylaws and — most important — different logos.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Contrary, perhaps, to popular belief, the Paralympics have no formal relationship with the <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/olympic-rings" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Olympic rings</a>. Instead, the logo for the Paralympics is a swirl of red, blue and green crescents known as <a href="https://www.paralympic.org/logo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Agitos</a>, which derives from the Latin definition of “I move.”</p><p>And this is where Paralympians with tattoos of the Olympic rings ran into problems: The I.P.C. considered them to be a third-party advertisement for an entity (in this case, the Olympics) that was separate from its own. As such, those tattoos had to be covered up.</p><p>As an I.P.C. spokesman <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/olympics/news/rudy-garcia-tolson-olympic-rings-tattoo-paralympics-swimming" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained to NBC Sports in 2016</a>: “Displaying the Olympic rings confuses the public and impacts the understanding about the Paralympic brand, which is different to that of the Olympic one.”</p><p>The I.P.C. and the I.O.C. both prohibit advertisements on the bodies of athletes, with some obvious exceptions: logos of apparel brands on swim caps and track singlets, for example.</p><p>But for many Paralympians, the Olympic rings are not an advertisement. Far from it, they are viewed as a symbolic representation of their hard work as athletes.</p><p>Growing up in Southern California, Mr. Garcia-Tolson dreamed of becoming an Olympian, he said. And in his mind, that dream became a reality when, in 2004, as a double amputee, he qualified for his first Paralympics and won his first gold medal in Athens.</p></div></div><div><div><p>With his mother’s permission — he was only 16 at the time, he said — Mr. Garcia-Tolson marked the achievement by having the Olympic rings tattooed on his back, below his left shoulder.</p><p>“For me, my journey to the Paralympics is those Olympic rings,” he said. “That’s what it signifies — the pursuit of being the best.”</p><p>But when the I.P.C. began to crack down on imagery of the Olympic rings in 2012, Mr. Garcia-Tolson knew that it was his responsibility to cover up the tattoo for competitions. He may not have agreed with the rule, he said, but he was not about to risk being penalized.</p><p>“It was just part of our routine,” he said. “Before an event, it was: ‘All right, I need my cap, I need my goggles, I need my swimsuit and I need a Sharpie.’”</p><p>It was never an issue, he said, until he competed at a meet ahead of the Tokyo Paralympics in 2021 and was initially disqualified when the Sharpie ink covering his tattoo washed away during his race. Mr. Garcia-Tolson won an appeal and was reinstated.</p><p>After competing through 2022, Mr. Garcia-Tolson stepped away from competitive athletics to devote more time to his work at the <a href="https://www.challengedathletes.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Challenged Athletes Foundation</a>, which aims to provide people with physical disabilities more opportunities to be involved in sports.</p><p>He is planning a comeback for the 2028 Paralympics in Los Angeles. Should he qualify, he can leave his Sharpie at home.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Scott Cacciola writes features and profiles of people in the worlds of sports and entertainment for the Styles section of The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/scott-cacciola">More about Scott Cacciola</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/style/paralympics-olympic-rings-tattoo-ban.html">16</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/style/paralympics-olympic-rings-tattoo-ban.html">16</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Style Coverage</h2><h3>The latest in fashion, trends, love and more.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Most Wanted ‘Girl’ in Fashion: </strong>How did Miu Miu become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/style/miu-miu-miuccia-prada-miu-miu-girl.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-styles-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">fashion’s biggest success story</a> — halfway to $1 billion in sales for 2024?</p></li><li><p><strong>Hairstyle Heat Relief: </strong>On a hot day, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/us/heat-summer-hair.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-styles-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">getting hair off the back of your neck</a> is often the simplest way to start cooling down.
