Mr. Musk, who has become a close ally of Mr. Trump, eventually backed out of the battle, citing an old injury. He claimed Mr. Zuckerberg was at fault for not making himself available to fight later on.</p><p>Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, created three new board seats for the appointments, bringing the total number to 13. Mr. Zuckerberg said the company had also added <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/style/ferrari-jeep-fashion.html" title="">John Elkann</a>, the chief executive of Exor, a European-based holding company that controls Jeep and Ferrari, and Charlie Songhurst, a tech investor who previously worked at Microsoft and has recently advised Meta on artificial intelligence projects.</p><p>“We have massive opportunities ahead in A.I., wearables, and the future of social media, and our board will help us achieve our vision,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote.</p><p>Meta in recent years has begun to manufacture wearable technology, like gaming headsets and sunglasses equipped with cameras. It is also competing in a global A.I. race, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/technology/mark-zuckerberg-meta-ai.html" title="">launching its own generative system with “open source” code</a> so that it can be freely copied, modified and reused by anyone.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Meta has faced harsh Republican criticism of its content moderation on its social media platforms, which Mr. Trump and others argue amounts to censorship of conservative voices. Some of the people the president-elect has tapped to regulate the tech and other industries have promised to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/technology/trump-administration-speech-policy.html" title="">crack down</a> as a result.</p><p>In recent weeks, Mr. Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/us/politics/mark-zuckerberg-trump-meeting.html" title="">met with Mr. Trump</a> at Mar-a-Lago, during which the tech executive congratulated the president-elect on winning the election.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kate Conger is a technology reporter based in San Francisco.
