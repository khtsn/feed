    <h1>The Vance-Walz VP Debate and the Value of a Boring Suit</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Vance, with his false comments <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/us/politics/jd-vance-springfield-pets.html" title="">about pet-eating migrants</a> and polarizing views <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/nyregion/jd-vance-kamala-harris-cat-lady.html" title="">about women</a>, has been a sitting target for progressive pundits. Mr. Walz himself soared up the Democratic Party ranks <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/arts/tim-walz-trump-weird.html" title="">by hurling the term “weird”</a> at Mr. Vance and his fellow Republicans. At the same time, the Minnesota governor, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/us/politics/tim-walz-house-history.html" title="">with his legislative track record</a> and history of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/us/tim-walz-china.html" title="">visits to China</a> (even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/us/politics/tim-walz-hong-kong-tiananmen.html" title="">the exaggerated versions</a>), has been branded by Republicans as a Marxist radical.</p><p>There was certainly nothing radical in how either man looked at the debate.</p><p>“Bog standard” was how David Redlawsk, professor of political science at the University of Delaware, described the pair’s matching blank shirts and postage-stamp-size pins. Mr. Redlawsk did point out that Mr. Walz’s suit was shades darker than Mr. Vance’s, that his lighter blue was “a bit more professional looking” than Mr. Walz’s funereal black.</p><p>For both candidates it was a windy path to C-SPAN standard. When Mr. Vance sidled into public view in the midaughts as the author of the best seller <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/books/review-in-hillbilly-elegy-a-compassionate-analysis-of-the-poor-who-love-trump.html" title="">“Hillbilly Elegy,”</a> he dressed like an Eddie Bauer catalog model, in scuffed desert boots, his checked shirts tucked into slender jeans. Only in the past few years, as the junior senator from Ohio, has Mr. Vance fallen into the Capitol Hill standard suit-and-tie attire.</p><p>At 40, Mr. Vance has shed the boyish heft he carried a half-decade ago. Though he remains an outlier in politics for merely having a beard (he is the first major party nominee <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/style/jd-vance-beard-politics.html" title="">with facial hair</a> in 75 years), that scruff was well maintained on Tuesday night, with crisp edges, as if he buzzed it seconds before stepping behind the dais.</p><p>As for Mr. Walz, it was just two years ago, during a gubernatorial debate at Farmfest in Minnesota’s rural Redwood County, that Mr. Walz sparred with opponents in a T-shirt and forest green cap. On Tuesday his stock suit strove to show the distance he had traveled.</p></div></div>
