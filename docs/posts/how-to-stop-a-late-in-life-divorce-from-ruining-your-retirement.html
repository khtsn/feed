    <h1>How to Stop a Late-in-Life Divorce From Ruining Your Retirement</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>When Margye Solomon decided to end her 33-year marriage last year, she knew her finances would take a big hit.</p><p>“I didn’t have enough money to retire before I got divorced, and I have less now,” said Ms. Solomon, who, at 71, still works full time as head of social enterprise and nonprofit partnerships at Ellevate, a global women’s network.</p><p>Dividing assets evenly with her ex, a retired lawyer, left her with half as much in savings — but, Ms. Solomon said, “my happiness was worth more to me than the money.”</p><p>The 18 months since the split have been an exercise in frugality as Ms. Solomon rebuilds. To cut expenses, she moved from Nutley, N.J., to lower-cost Nashville, where she rents a small apartment in a friend’s home; she bought a used Nissan to get around and watches her spending.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“When you divorce at this age, you can’t be afraid to change your lifestyle,” Ms. Solomon said. “In what could be a 100-year life, I figure I have 20 to 30 years left and I want to make the most of them.”</p><p>Ms. Solomon has plenty of company. While divorce rates in the United States have generally been falling, they have doubled for people over age 50 since the 1990s and tripled among those over 65, according to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/77/9/1710/6564346?login=false&amp;tpcc=NL_Marketing#google_vignette" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 2022 study</a> from Bowling Green State University in Ohio. Longer life expectancies and a rise in older women working, which makes divorce more feasible economically, are helping to drive the trend. All told, nearly 40 percent of divorces now involve someone who qualifies for AARP membership.</p><p>These couples may be happier apart than together, but they have a lot to lose financially. Women can be hit especially hard: Wives who divorce after 50 see a 45 percent decline on average in their standard of living, versus a 21 percent drop for husbands of the same age — and those losses can be persistent, a separate <a href="https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/76/10/2073/5903434?tpcc=NL_Marketing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bowling Green study</a> found.</p><p>“Following these individuals for a decade after their divorce, we’re not seeing appreciable recovery,” said Susan Brown, a Bowling Green sociology professor who was one of the authors of the studies.</p><p>If you’re divorcing after 50, how can you better prepare — financially — for the years ahead? “The key is coming to terms, both practically and emotionally, with the fact that your retirement is going to look different than what you thought it would be, and being willing to adjust accordingly,” said Chris Chen, a certified divorce financial analyst in Newton, Mass.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>These moves can help.</p><h2 id="link-1c1990a6">Get a Grip on Your New Reality</h2><p>Reaching a fair settlement lays the groundwork for financial recovery after a later-in-life divorce. For that, you first need a handle on the income, assets and household expenses you’re working with — an exercise that can be unexpectedly challenging, particularly if one partner solely managed the finances.</p><p>“It can feel like the numbers are judging you,” said Stephanie McCullough, a certified financial planner in Berwyn, Pa. “But it’s to both parties’ benefit to be as complete as possible, to see what will be realistic going forward.”</p><p>For Nancy Howell, 60, a former elementary schoolteacher who left money management mostly to her pilot husband during their 37-year marriage, this financial fact-finding exercise felt like “a gut punch,” she said, as she learned her name wasn’t on the mortgage and some other accounts. “It was like I didn’t exist,” Ms. Howell said.</p><p>Ms. Howell, whose divorce was finalized last year, elected to keep her five-bedroom home in Tempe, Ariz., as part of the settlement and got spousal support to help maintain it. But once her ex-husband retires later this month and the support payments stop, Ms. Howell, who works part-time as a substitute and after-school teacher, will have to tap into her retirement savings to afford the upkeep on the house.</p><p>“In retrospect, keeping the house was a really bad call, given that it’s just me and the dog now,” said Ms. Howell, who has three adult children. “I would have more financial flexibility and confidence if I downsized by half.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-5f4190fe">Focus on the Biggest Assets</h2><p>One spouse hanging onto the house — which, along with retirement accounts, are typically the most valuable assets that couples hold — is common, divorce experts said. But it’s often a financial mistake, especially if the children are grown.</p><p>That’s because you typically have to trade a portion of retirement savings to buy out the other spouse at a time when you’re close to winding down a career or may already have stopped working, said Lili Vasileff, a certified divorce financial analyst in Greenwich, Conn. And, the most pressing financial need after a split is typically cash flow, so tying up funds in an illiquid asset isn’t helpful.</p><p>“I ask clients, ‘If the house will eat up 70 percent of your income, are you willing to sacrifice 70 percent of everything else in your budget to keep it?’” Ms. Vasileff said.</p><p>Where you live plays a critical role in how retirement plans such as individual retirement accounts, pensions and 401(k)s are divided. In the country’s nine community property states — including Arizona, California and Texas — retirement assets acquired during the marriage will be split evenly. Elsewhere, state guidelines suggest a fair distribution based on factors such as the length of the marriage and each spouse’s financial situation.</p><p>State law also usually provides a formula for whether spousal support should be awarded, taking into account the length of the marriage and how much time a lower-earning or stay-at-home spouse needs to become self-supporting. An important additional factor for older couples: how long the higher earner has until retirement, when support typically ends, no matter how long the couple was married.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“That’s a rude awakening for many older people, primarily women, who end up with fewer years of support than expected,” Ms. Vasileff said.</p><h2 id="link-24523e3e">Aim to Be Amicable</h2><p>You’re not obligated, though, to follow the state guidelines. Everything is negotiable.</p><p>You can also negotiate matters that aren’t covered by state law, such as compensating a lower-earning partner for the loss of future Social Security benefits or health insurance. By federal law, a divorced spouse is typically entitled to up to half of her ex-partner’s benefit at full retirement, as long as they were married for at least 10 consecutive<strong> </strong>years; half of his benefit would be greater than what she would qualify for on her own; and she has not remarried. But that’s far less than what she would have access<strong> </strong>to if she were still married: her spouse’s full benefit, as well as her own smaller one.</p><p>“That’s a real whammy for women, who are more often the lower-earning spouse,” said Nancy Hetrick, a certified divorce financial analyst in Phoenix.</p><p>You can seek a larger share of a retirement account or other assets to help offset the impact of reduced Social Security benefits. But that strategy has the best chance of success, Ms. Hetrick said, if you opt for a mediated or collaborative divorce. A bonus to that approach: Mediation costs much less than a litigated settlement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/16/multimedia/16retiring-graydivorce-2-bwvq/16retiring-graydivorce-2-bwvq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/16/multimedia/16retiring-graydivorce-2-bwvq/16retiring-graydivorce-2-bwvq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/16/multimedia/16retiring-graydivorce-2-bwvq/16retiring-graydivorce-2-bwvq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Jeff Fleisher in a dark-green shirt and round glasses outdoors.

A retired information technology director from Windsor, Calif., Mr. Fleisher and his wife of 29 years divorced this year, but they haven’t finalized a financial agreement. The assets still being negotiated: an inherited I.R.A. and other investments that Mr. Fleisher said were separate property he acquired before the marriage. Both parties have retained lawyers, and Mr. Fleisher’s legal fees have so far exceeded $50,000, he said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Lawyers are not the panacea — they’re there to make money,” Mr. Fleisher said. “My advice is: If there’s any way to just work out a deal with your ex, do it.”</p><h2 id="link-5a2d6ad5">Rethink Your Lifestyle</h2><p>To manage the financial hit of a later-in-life divorce, you basically have two choices, Ms. Hetrick said: “Redo your retirement plans considerably and scale back on some things you thought you’d do, or figure out how to make more money — or both.”</p><p>If you have a job, you can make up ground by postponing your retirement date. “Working even for a couple of years more can make miracles happen financially,” Mr. Chen said.</p><p>Already retired? Ageism or health issues may preclude returning to work full-time, but even a part-time gig can be helpful. “Every dollar that comes in is a dollar you don’t need to spend from savings,” Ms. McCullough said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>You might also consider putting some settlement money toward professional development. Adding a certification or technical skill can help you earn more to pad savings.</p><p>That’s what Gillian Overton, 65, has done in the 10 years since her divorce. A former high school teacher, Ms. Overton used part of her settlement — she received half of her ex-husband’s pension as well as spousal support until he retired 18 months ago — to retrain as a therapist, which she hopes will allow her to extend her career.</p><p>Ms. Overton, who relocated to her native England a few years ago from Far Hills, N.J., has lived comfortably since the divorce. But she is worried now that alimony has ended. “I feel like I’m looking into the abyss, wondering if my money will last,” she said. “It’s scary doing this on your own.”</p><p>Still, she said, she’s satisfied with the path she’s chosen — and experts say that’s a sentiment they often hear from clients who divorce in their later years. “The process is not just about rebuilding your nest egg,” Ms. McCullough said. “It’s about rebuilding your life in a way that’s more deeply satisfying for you.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>BU</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>7</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Divorces Late in Life Raise Financial Risks<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Let Us Help You Plan for Retirement</h2><h3>The good news is that we’re living longer.
