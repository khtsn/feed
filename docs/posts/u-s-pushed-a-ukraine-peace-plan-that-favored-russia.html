    <h1>U.S. Pushed a Ukraine Peace Plan That Favored Russia</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Vice President JD Vance said today that the U.S. would “walk away” from negotiations to end the war in Ukraine unless both sides agreed to the American peace plan. The terms, as Vance laid out to reporters for the first time, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/world/europe/ukraine-cease-fire-talks-london.html" title="">closely align with Russia’s longstanding goals</a>.</p><p>Under the plan, there would be a “freeze” of territorial lines, acceptance of the annexation of Crimea by Russia and a promise that Ukraine would not join NATO. Russia currently occupies 18.7 percent of Ukraine, according to one estimate.</p><p>Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, has said he would accept a cease-fire as long as Ukraine drops its NATO aspirations and withdraws its troops from the four regions that Russia has claimed. However, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine made clear that he would reject any agreement that recognized the annexation of Crimea. “There is nothing to talk about,” he said. “This violates our Constitution. This is our territory, the territory of the people of Ukraine.”</p><p>In response, President Trump lashed out today at Zelensky: “He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “The statement made by Zelenskyy today will do nothing but prolong the ‘killing field,’ and nobody wants that!”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-5dea7b62">Treasury secretary said U.S.-China tariffs are not sustainable</h2><p>On the sidelines of the spring meetings of the I.M.F. and the World Bank, Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, said today that the White House <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/business/bessent-imf-world-bank-overhauls.html" title="">would not lower its tariffs on imports from China</a> before holding negotiations with Beijing. So far, they have not been scheduled. However, Bessent suggested that both sides would eventually agree to reduce the levies.</p><p>“I don’t think either side believes that the current tariff levels are sustainable,” he said. For now, China’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/business/china-tariffs-robots-automation.html" title="">army of factory robots</a> — used in both big manufacturers and in back-alley workshops — could allow it to hold off on major price hikes, giving it an advantage in the trade war.</p><p><strong>In related news, </strong>Britain indicated that it would not <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/business/britain-us-trade-deal.html" title="">rush into a trade deal with the U.S.</a> nor would it change food and automotive safety standards to reach one.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elon Musk at the White House this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-e0c9c0a">Musk has hit a rough patch</h2><p>Elon Musk vowed yesterday to spend less time in Washington, and more with his electric vehicle company, Tesla, which reported a profit drop of 71 percent in the first quarter. He acknowledged, to an extent, that his work slashing the federal government has made him reviled in parts of the country, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/polls/doge-elon-musk.html" title="">as polling indicates</a>.</p><p>Musk also said that China’s halt on exports of certain magnets was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/business/elon-musk-tesla-robots.html" title="">stalling his plans to build humanoid robots</a>. He’s even been sparring with Trump aides and allies on X, the social platform he owns.
