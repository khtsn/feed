Trump.</p><p>“Standing here as my mother’s daughter, and my daughter’s mother, I’m so happy this day has come,” Mrs. Clinton, the first woman nominated for president by a major party, said that night.</p><p>Eight years later, Mrs. Clinton came out of semiretirement to return to a Democratic convention, this time in Chicago, to celebrate a woman — Kamala Harris — who is trying to do what Ms. Clinton was unable to do: win. It was a generational handoff at a convention that has become all about generational change, from a 76-year-old former first lady to the 59-year-old vice president.</p><p>But it was also a poignant reminder of how close Mrs. Clinton came to breaking the “highest and hardest glass ceiling,” as she had put it in her concession speech.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“Tonight,” she said on Monday night, “so close to breaking through once and for all, I want to tell you what I see through all those cracks, and why it matters for each and every one of us.”</p><p>“On the other side of that glass ceiling is Kamala Harris raising her hand and taking the oath of office as our 47th president of the United States,” Mrs. Clinton said, her words drowned out by the cheers of delegates rising to their feet.</p><p>In many ways, Mrs. Clinton’s appearance was a much-delayed opportunity for Democrats to honor this woman who has been a fixture in the party since 1992, when a convention in New York nominated her husband, Bill, to run for president. In 2020, Mrs. Clinton addressed the convention remotely, a face on a screen, speaking from her living room in Chappaqua, N.Y., a reflection of the pared-down convention staged in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>This time, she stepped out onto the stage and was greeted with wall of cheers and applause that lasted more than 90 seconds before Mrs. Clinton was able to quiet the crowd and begin speaking. In the hall, some delegates wept as they watched her return to the stage.</p><p>“She gave me the hope to believe,” said Myra Mills Tschirhart, 35, of Fort Worth, Texas. “She’s talking about the glass ceiling as something you look through, something you can see through. It’s just beautiful.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>The former first lady began by noting that her mother, Dorothy Rodham, was born in Chicago before women had the right to vote. Mrs. Clinton described taking her daughter, Chelsea, to see Geraldine Ferraro be celebrated in 1984 as the first woman nominated as vice president. And she recalled her own moment in 2016 in Philadelphia.</p><p>“It was honor of my life to accept our party’s nomination for president,” Mrs. Clinton said. “Nearly 66 million Americans voted for a future where there are no ceilings on our dreams.”</p><p>“Well, my friends, the future is here,” she added.</p><p>Over the course of 16 minutes, Mrs. Clinton did not just dwell on the past. She mocked the man who defeated her in 2016. “Donald Trump fell asleep at his own trial,” she said. “When he woke up, he’d made his own kind of history — the first person to run for president with 34 felony convictions.”</p><p>At that, the delegates rose to their feet again, repurposing a line that Mr. Trump used against Mrs. Clinton when he ran against her: “Lock him up,” they chanted. Mrs. Clinton paused, nodded and smiled, but did not join in.</p><p>As she closed her remarks, Mrs. Clinton, clearly speaking from experience, cautioned her audience not to be lulled by polls that suggest Ms. Harris is ahead. “We have him on the run now,” she said. “But no matter what the polls say, we can’t give up.”</p><p>“I want my grandchildren and their grandchildren to know I was here, that we were here, and that we were with Kamala every step of the way,” she said. “This is our time, America. This is when we stand up. This is when we break through.”</p><p>Kellen Browning<!-- --> contributed reporting from Chicago.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Nagourney is a national political reporter for The Times, covering the 2024 campaign.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-nagourney">More about Adam Nagourney</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/democratic-party">Democratic Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/hillary-rodham-clinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="NYT_BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT_REGION" data-testid="region"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2024-election-footer-carousel" data-id="100000009577677" data-source-id="100000009577677"><div>
