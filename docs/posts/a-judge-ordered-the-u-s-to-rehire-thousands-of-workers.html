He directed the Treasury and the Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy and Interior Departments to reinstate any employees who had been terminated in such a manner. “It was a sham,” Alsup said.</p><p>The reprieve for fired workers may be only temporary. Alsup clarified that agencies can still legally conduct large-scale layoffs, which are known as a “reduction in force.” The Office of Personnel Management had set a deadline of today for agencies to submit reduction in force plans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Vladimir Putin of Russia, right, today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Maxim Shemetov</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-535ff683">Putin said he was not ready to agree to a cease-fire</h2><p>President Vladimir Putin made it clear during a news conference today that he was in no hurry to agree to a truce with Ukraine. Two days after Kyiv said it would agree to a monthlong cease-fire, Putin said he was in favor of “the idea” of a short truce, but added that there were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/13/world/russia-ukraine-moscow-war-kursk" title="">“questions we need to discuss.”</a></p><p>Those questions, Putin said, included whether Ukraine would be able to continue receiving arms shipments during the truce, and how the cease-fire would be enforced. He also said that he would not allow Ukrainian forces to peacefully withdraw from Russia’s Kursk region, where Russian troops <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/world/europe/kursk-ukraine-russia-war.html" title="">have recently made progress</a>. He encouraged them to “simply surrender.”</p><p>The conditions that Putin laid out would most likely delay any truce, or potentially even make one impossible to achieve, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/world/europe/putin-russia-ukraine-ceasefire.html" title="">our Moscow bureau chief Anton Troianovski wrote</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">James Hill for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-11970ae0">Trump threatened a 200% tariff on champagne</h2><p>Trump threatened today to escalate his trade war with the E.U. He said he would impose a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-tariff-european-union-whiskey.html" title="">200 percent fee on all alcohol imported from the bloc</a> in retaliation for Europe’s new levies on U.S. whiskey and other products — which themselves were imposed in response to America’s new metal tariffs.</p><p>The new levies deepened anxiety on both sides of the Atlantic. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.4 percent, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/business/sp-500-stocks-market-correction.html" title="">tumbling into a “correction”</a> — a drop that suggests that the two-year-long bull market may be running out of steam.</p><p>Some of Trump’s allies consider the president’s threats largely a negotiating tactic. But the White House insists that he is setting out to bring manufacturing jobs back to America. It’s a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-manufacturing-economy-risk.html" title="">significant gamble</a>, as my colleague David Sanger wrote.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The moon during a lunar eclipse in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">J.
