The scope of Russian attacks continues to grow, despite staggering losses, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/world/europe/ukraine-russia-attacks-eastern-front.html" title="">and Russia is throwing greater numbers of soldiers into the assaults</a> than it did in some earlier stages of the fighting, according to soldiers and military analysts.</p><p>The Russian troops have also been using electric scooters, motorcycles and ATVs, which allow them to disperse quickly across the front, a Ukrainian official told The Times. The stepped-up attacks have heightened longstanding concerns over how Ukraine manages its military and have countered assumptions that Moscow’s offensive would slow.</p><p>In Russia, President Vladimir Putin used his New Year’s Eve address to say the country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/world/europe/putin-russia-ukraine-speech.html" title="">was overcoming every challenge and moving forward</a>. But he did not say where Russia was going, even as it suffers huge casualties in its war in Ukraine, struggles with rising inflation and absorbs diplomatic blows abroad.</p><p><strong>For more:</strong> Outnumbered and desperate, Ukraine has begun <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/magazine/drones-weapons-ukraine-war.html" title="">using explosives to turn cheap consumer drones into suicide drones</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Justin Lane/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-60af14e6">Wall Street sees more gains ahead</h2><p>The S&amp;P 500 index was down slightly today, the final trading day of 2024, but it rose about 23.3 percent this year, roughly matching its gain in 2023.

Here’s what they said:</p><blockquote><p><em>To take that trip.</em> In early 2024, you asked readers what was the best advice they’d ever received. One lady wrote, “Book the Trip.” That advice became my 2024 resolution. I booked a trip to the Great Barrier Reef, which had been on my bucket list for ages. Furthermore, I traveled solo. The entire experience was fantastic. My 2025 resolution is to keep traveling and book another trip! — <em>Margaret Anne Breuer, Sarasota, Florida</em></p><p><em>To write a gratitude letter to someone every day.</em> I kept the resolution by turning it into a simple, daily ritual. By the end of the year, I had written 365 letters to friends, family, teachers, mentors and even people I hadn’t spoken to in years. What surprised me most was how this resolution didn’t just impact the people receiving the letters — it also transformed the way I saw the world. By focusing on gratitude daily, I deepened my relationships, rekindled old ones and learned to find beauty in even the smallest moments of connection. — <em>Joelle Roth, Makati, Philippines</em></p></blockquote><hr/><h2 id="link-30bfda4">Dinner table topics</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Illustration by Ben Denzer; source photographs by Paul Denzer and Daria LeGrand</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><ul><li><p><strong>At-home beauty:</strong> As the science of skin care expands, some of those advances have landed directly in consumers’ hands. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/style/home-beauty-device-trends.html" title="">Is that a good thing?</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Food tourism is dead:</strong> In an Opinion piece, a writer argues that the real cutting edge of culinary exploration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/opinion/food-tourism-travel-instagram-tiktok.html" title="">is the intersection of tradition and diaspora</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>No laughing matter:</strong> For comics, honing jokes has taken a back seat to marketing. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/arts/television/netflix-comedy-marketing.html" title="">That’s not good</a>, our comedy critic writes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Raw water:</strong> Untreated water enthusiasts swear by natural springs.
