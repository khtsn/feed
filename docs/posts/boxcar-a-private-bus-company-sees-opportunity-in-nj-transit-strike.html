And we’re taking that gamble. These buses are going to be running no matter what next week.”</p><p>It was one of several ways that Boxcar, which is based in Chatham, N.J., has used its online presence to take advantage of the disruption brought about by the New Jersey Transit rail strike, which began when unionized locomotive engineers walked off the job after midnight on Friday. The company offers customers more than a dozen pickup locations in suburban New Jersey to take luxury commuter buses into Midtown Manhattan. Trips are booked with an app.</p><p>Boxcar introduced a <a href="https://strikeclock.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Strike Clock”</a> website that included a strike-countdown widget, a “strike odds” tracker and details about new bus lines that the company said would fill some of the gaps in the event of a walkout. Company employees have shared videos from what they call their “situation room,” including podcast-style interviews with Boxcar’s chief executive, Joe Colangelo. (Mr. Colangelo could not be reached for comment.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJkzN8vM9Zj/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a recorded conversation</a> with Mr. Colangelo that was posted on Instagram earlier this week, Mr. O’Donovan said that Boxcar would run twice as many buses on Friday as on a typical weekday, adding thousands of seats to serve commuters. And on Thursday, Boxcar went live on Instagram to discuss the strike and take questions from customers.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In this screen shot from Boxcar’s Instagram account, Kevin O’Donovan, a business development associate for the private bus company, promotes Boxcar’s services in the days leading up to the strike.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">@boxcartransit</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Colangelo founded Boxcar in 2017, when he rented out space in his driveway in Cranford, N.J., where commuters could park their cars before <a href="https://www.tapinto.net/towns/madison/articles/innovative-tech-company-boxcar-offers-solution-to-suburban-commute" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">catching a train</a> to Manhattan. Within a few years, Boxcar had expanded its business by inviting commuters to book luxury buses for rides into Manhattan as a kind of middle ground between public transit and expensive black cars. During the height of the pandemic, with many white-collar employees working form home, the company shifted to other services, such as grocery delivery. According to its website, Boxcar also offers services ranging from <a href="https://www.boxcar.com/local-services/auto-detailing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">knife sharpening to car detailing</a>.</p><p>The company has also been sending conversational emails to customers, including one on Thursday announcing expanded service to commuters in South Orange and Maplewood.</p><p>“These buses are more expensive than our normal ones,” it said, “because we are paying a significantly higher rate per bus than normal. Even if they’re full, it’s likely they’ll only break even, but the demand for buses right now is like nothing we’ve ever seen, and it’s worth it to us to take the risk in order to help you with a better contingency plan.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It is unclear how many of the bus lines will continue to operate after the strike ends.</p><p>Boxcar’s email outreach stood in stark contrast to that of New Jersey Transit, which took a more traditional approach when communicating with its customers about the strike.</p><p>“We understand the inconvenience this may cause,” it said in an email to customers as the strike was announced just after midnight on Friday, “and appreciate your patience and understanding as we work toward a resolution.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sopan Deb is a Times reporter covering breaking news and culture.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Beekeeper Charged With a Genocidal Secret:</strong> Faustin Nsabumukunzi lived quietly in New York.
