This week, a series of cabinet nominations by Mr. Trump showed the potential dangers posed by his reliance on his inner circle in the starkest way possible.</p><p>For three of the nation’s highest-ranking and most vital positions, Mr. Trump said he would appoint loyalists with no discernible qualifications for their jobs, people manifestly inappropriate for crucial positions of leadership in law enforcement and national security.</p><p>The most irresponsible was his choice for attorney general. To fill the post of the nation’s chief law enforcement officer, the president-elect said he would nominate Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida.</p><p>Yes, that Matt Gaetz.</p><p>The one who called for the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/03/03/matt-gaetz-abolish-fbi-cpac/11391112002/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">abolishment</a> of the F.B.I. and the entire Justice Department if they didn’t stop investigating Mr. Trump. The one who was among the loudest congressional voices in denying the results of the 2020 election, who said he was <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/01/06/matt-gaetz-jan-6-capitol-riot" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“proud of the work”</a> that he and other deniers did on Jan. 6, 2021, and who praised the Capitol rioters as “patriotic Americans” who had no intention of committing violence. The one whose move to oust Speaker Kevin McCarthy in 2023 paralyzed his own party’s leadership of the House for nearly a month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Gaetz, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/13/us/trump-news/1c08fcab-27d9-5cba-94ac-dbfe87f27637?smid=url-share" title="">submitted his letter</a> of resignation from Congress on Wednesday after his nomination was announced, was the target of a yearslong federal sex-trafficking investigation that led to an 11-year prison term for one of his associates, though he denied any involvement. The Justice Department closed that investigation, but the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/matt-gaetz-house-ethics-committee/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">House Ethics Committee is still looking into</a> allegations of <a href="https://ethics.house.gov/press-releases/statement-regarding-matter-representative-matt-gaetz" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sexual misconduct</a>, illicit drug use, improper acceptance of gifts and obstruction of government investigations of his conduct. Kevin McCarthy, the former House speaker, blamed Mr. Gaetz for his ouster, on the grounds that Mr. Gaetz “wanted me to stop an ethics complaint because he slept with a 17-year-old.”</p><p>This is the man Mr. Trump has selected to lead the 115,000-person agency that he has called the most important in the federal government, a position whose enforcement role could cause the most trouble for any president with corrupt intent. Even for Mr. Trump, it was a stunning demonstration of his disregard for basic competence and government experience, and of his duty to lead the executive branch in a sober and patriotic way. It will now be up to the Senate to say he has gone too far and reject this nomination.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s list of appointments is just getting started but already includes two other unqualified nominations that he announced this week: former Representative Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence, and Pete Hegseth to be secretary of defense.</p><p>Ms. Gabbard, who previously represented Hawaii in the House and regularly appears on Fox News, is not only devoid of intelligence experience but has repeatedly taken positions in direct opposition to American foreign policy and national security interests. She has appeared on several occasions to side with strongmen like President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.</p><p>Mr. Hegseth, a co-host of “Fox &amp; Friends,” is perhaps even more unqualified, given the gravity — not to mention the budget — of the post he would assume. He enjoys some support from enlisted service members and veterans, but outside of serving two tours as an Army infantryman in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as time in Guantánamo Bay, Mr. Hegseth has no experience in government or national defense.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“He’s never run a big institution, much less one of the largest and most hidebound on the planet,” the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/pete-hegseth-secretary-of-defense-donald-trump-pentagon-military-fox-news-6ea89c1a?mod=hp_opin_pos_0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Wednesday. “He has no experience in government outside the military, and no small risk is that the bureaucracy will eat him alive.” The board went on to call Mr. Hegseth a ”culture warrior” at a time when there are much bigger security issues for the Pentagon to be focused on.</p><p>It’s far from certain Mr. Hegseth could even obtain the security clearances required for the job. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/war-warriors-pete-hegseth-shocking-never-biden-inauguration-story-new-book" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">He has said</a> he was one of a dozen National Guard members removed from service at President Biden’s inauguration in 2021 because of concerns that he was an extremist — possibly because of a tattoo he wears that is popular among white supremacists.</p><p>These are some of the most consequential roles in government, protecting the country from military and terrorist threats, investigating domestic criminal conspiracies, and prosecuting thousands of federal crimes every year. Yet to fill them Mr. Trump has resorted to people whose only eligibility for office is an apparent willingness to say yes to his every demand.</p><p>Mr. Gaetz in particular has joined Mr. Trump in expressing a commitment to exacting vengeance against anyone they believe has done them wrong. Mr. Trump began his campaign by saying “I am your retribution,” and Mr. Gaetz broadcasts nothing so much as that. He has no business leading an agency with the role of combating crime, fraud, violations of civil rights and threats to national security, among many other things.</p><p>In Mr. Trump’s first term, the department was protected by career prosecutors and other civil servants who understood that their primary obligation was to the dictates of the Constitution, not to the whims of the president. But Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/us/politics/trump-federal-bureaucracy.html" title="">promised to purge people</a> like that from his second administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The possibility of extreme appointments like these was the reason the Constitution gives the Senate the right to refuse its consent to a president’s wishes. Last week, Republicans won control of the chamber. Now they will be confronted with an immediate test: Will they stand up for the legislative branch and for the American system of checks and balances? Two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/matt-gaetz-attorney-general-senate-republicans.html" title="">have already expressed strong skepticism</a> of Mr. Gaetz’s nomination, and others have declined to express their support.</p><p>Mr. Trump clearly expects the Senate to simply roll over and ignore its responsibilities. He wants to turn the leaders of major important agencies into his deputies, remaking the federal government into a Trump Inc. organization chart entirely subordinate to him. He recently demanded that the Senate give him the ability to make recess appointments, a way of bypassing the Senate’s consent process when the chamber is adjourned for 10 days or more.</p><p>Even Republican senators refused to consent to that demand during his first term, to preserve their constitutional role, and on Wednesday Senate Republicans voted to reject as their leader Rick Scott of Florida, who <a href="https://x.com/SenRickScott/status/1855693759281053758" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> he would have no problem allowing recess appointments. Instead they chose John Thune of South Dakota, who is far more likely to uphold his chamber’s right to refuse consent of president nominations.</p><p>In Mr. Trump’s second term, senators will immediately be confronted with an extreme set of appointments even worse than those of the first term. That makes all the more important that they preserve the ability to say no.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.
