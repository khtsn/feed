    <h1>Inside a Kamala Harris Ad Promoting Her Economic Plans</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign is running versions of </em><a href="https://adm0.page.link/BfCi" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>this 60-second ad</em></a><em>, titled “Different Visions” — with the same audio but different images — on stations in each of the seven battleground states and in Omaha. The campaign has spent $2.3 million on the ad since early September, according to AdImpact.</em></p><h2 id="link-2c6436f">On the Screen</h2><p>The audio in each of the ads was recorded when Ms. Harris delivered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/us/politics/kamala-harris-raleigh-nc-economy.html" title="">a speech outlining her economic plans</a> in North Carolina in August. The visual scenes, as the ads begin, are appropriate to each targeted electorate: <a href="https://adm0.page.link/BfCi" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In Wisconsin</a>, it is the Milwaukee skyline; <a href="https://adm0.page.link/UW7z" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in Michigan</a>, it’s Detroit, and so on in <a href="https://adm0.page.link/roi6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="https://adm0.page.link/fBDa" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Georgia</a> and <a href="https://adm0.page.link/kf2f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">North Carolina</a>. <a href="https://adm0.page.link/uNmD" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nebraska</a>’s ad shows just corn and farmland.</p><p>A car’s side-view mirror represents the past. Other images include a multiracial family at a dinner table, an older man in a cornfield, a young woman dancing alone while stocking a supermarket shelf, bins of fresh tomatoes and vegetables, a crowd at a Harris event cheering, the words “tax cut,” a house under construction, people happily carrying boxes into a house, and several shots of Ms. Harris speaking.</p><p>The version of the ad <a href="https://adm0.page.link/vapJ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">running in Arizona and Nevada</a> substitutes scenes of the desert and residential sprawl for city skylines, a Latino construction worker for the family at a dinner table and a restaurant worker sorting red peppers for the woman dancing in the supermarket. It also displays Spanish translations of Ms. Harris’s words.</p></div></div>
