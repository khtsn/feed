Such plans also largely rely on contributions by employees, who may not be able to afford to set enough money aside, ultimately reducing retirement income. Companies often match a certain portion of the money contributed by workers, which effectively caps how much money they spend on retirement benefits.</p><p>Even though Boeing executives would like the strike to end — so they can focus on efforts to restore the company’s reputation after two fatal crashes roughly five years ago and poor financial results — few labor experts expect them to soften their stance on pensions.</p><p>“I don’t think Boeing is going to go back,” said Harry Katz, a professor at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, noting that the company is focused on controlling expenses as it tries to regain the confidence of Wall Street.</p><p>Most investors are likely to oppose the reinstatement of a defined-benefit plan because such pensions could undermine Boeing’s financial position. Bank of America stock analysts estimate that offering such a plan would on average cost Boeing $300 million to $400 million more annually than what it spends on its 401(k) plan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Striking machinists counting ballots.

Nearly 62 percent of the private-sector workers who had access to workplace plans had only defined-benefit pensions at the time, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, an independent organization that tracks retirement issues.</p><p>Corporations began shifting away from pensions in the early 1980s in favor of 401(k) plans. These newer plans were easier and less expensive to manage because companies were on the hook for only their portion of contributions to the plan. Unlike a defined-benefit plan, a 401(k) plan leaves companies under no obligation to put in more money if it does not generate enough income to meet a guaranteed payment to retirees.</p><p>By 2021, just 1 percent of workers with employer plans had access to only a defined-benefit plan and 84 percent had only a 401(k), the institute found, while 15 percent had access to both. </p><p>At the turn of the century, after the tech bubble burst and interest rates declined, many pension funds became noticeably underfunded. Stricter funding and accounting rules followed in 2006 — those changes made defined-benefit plans even less appealing for corporations because they forced businesses to put more money into the plans and recognize pension liabilities as debt, according to the Center for Retirement Research.</p><p>As a result, private-sector pensions began to vanish more rapidly. Employers began closing the plans to new workers and freezing benefits for those already enrolled in them, reducing their liabilities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Today, 42 percent of I.A.M. members are still part of the defined-benefit pension, according to Boeing.

The union’s leaders believed compromise on the pension was necessary to stop Boeing from moving to a state with labor laws that favored employers over unions. But many in the rank and file believed the company would not have been able to make good on its threat to move vast amounts of its production elsewhere. (Boeing does have a nonunion plant in South Carolina, where it makes the 787 Dreamliner.)</p><p>“We vowed to never be placed in a position where we had no leverage,” Mr. Holden said in an interview in September, describing the events of 2014.</p><p>Today, 42 percent of I.A.M. members are still part of the defined-benefit pension, according to Boeing. In the rejected proposal, the company offered to increase the payout from the pension.

And Mr. Holden said he was willing to explore “other defined-benefit options” and “to see what we can do to be creative and provide something that our members deserve.”</p><p>It is not exactly clear what Boeing could offer that would satisfy a majority of the machinists’ union.
