His family could not immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>Known for using tables and chairs in the ring, Brunk rose to national prominence in the U.S. with Extreme Championship Wrestling, a smaller and grittier circuit compared to the more mainstream World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling companies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Sabu became a national star as part of E.C.W., where he was a pioneer of hardcore wrestling, leaping from chairs and driving his opponents through tables and even barbed wire,” W.W.E. said in its statement.</p><p>Brunk later joined the W.W.E. in 2006, with which he performed for a year, including at WrestleMania 23 in Detroit, his hometown.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEIYO4KIJWc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">As recently as last month</a>, Brunk was slinging chairs around a barbed-wire ring, returning once again as Sabu in an event with the wrestler Joey Janela that was billed as Sabu’s retirement match.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Although widely remembered for his use of props and tables in the ring, Sabu was wary of professional wrestling’s spectacle. He would go on to criticize the larger-than-life stunts that would come to define later iterations of the W.W.E. and other wrestling promotion companies.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“In an Olympic match, you cannot stack a couple tables and then climb something and jump off. That’s a stunt,” he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ACrUDlBxH4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told an interviewer</a> with Covalent TV at Wrestlecade in 2024. “I’m not a stuntman or an actor.”</p><p>Terrance Michael Brunk was born on Staten Island, N.Y. He was trained by his uncle <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/26/sports/edward-farhat-78-dies-the-sheik-of-pro-wrestling.html" title="">Edward George Farhart</a>, a W.W.E. Hall of Fame wrestler known as “The Sheikh.”</p><p>“I went over all the basics every day,” Brunk recalled in his Covalent TV interview. His uncle, he said, made him set up and tear down the training ring for months before ever giving him a chance inside it.</p><p>For many fans, Brunk represented an era of professional wrestling when storytelling took priority over spectacle. He said in his 2024 interview that even his use of a single table could keep an audience engaged — there was a narrative arc, a setup, a tease. Not so in modern professional wrestling, he said.</p><p>“When they break a table,” he said, “they’re just doing it for the crash.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ali Watkins covers international news and is based in London.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>21</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Terry Brunk, ‘Hardcore’ Pro Wrestler Known as Sabu<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
