Five Israelis who had been hospitalized with injuries were discharged, the police said, and between 20 and 30 others sustained light injuries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Concerned about the safety of its citizens, Israel’s government warned fans in Amsterdam to stay off the streets and helped arrange at least three flights to bring Israeli citizens home — an unusual move since the national airline, El Al, normally does not operate on the Sabbath.</p><p>Street disturbances in Amsterdam, the Dutch capital, had been building since Wednesday night, a day before the match between an Israeli club, Maccabi Tel Aviv, and the Dutch team Ajax. Some people angered by the war in Gaza were upset that the Israeli team and their supporters had come to the city, and a protest had been planned for Thursday.</p><p>The Dutch police said that the night before the game Israeli fans had vandalized a taxi and burned a Palestinian flag. Officers later intervened to protect a group of several hundred Israeli supporters inside an Amsterdam casino after what the police described as an online call among taxi drivers to mobilize themselves.</p><p>On game day, the tension and violence continued. Videos showed Israeli fans on their way to the match shouting an anti-Arab chant as they were escorted by the police near Amsterdam’s central train station. At the stadium, the police said, riot police units and mounted officers were required to keep pro-Palestinian groups and Israeli fans apart.</p><p>The game went on largely without incident, but confrontations and assaults on Israeli fans took place in several parts of the city in the hours after the match.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>More than 800 police officers had been mobilized throughout the city in anticipation of the game, the Dutch authorities said, an extraordinarily large number that reflected trepidation about the potential collision of Israeli fans and supporters of the Palestinian cause in a city with a significant Muslim population.</p><p>“Because of an announced pro-Palestinian demonstration, in combination with the commemoration of Kristallnacht, we foresaw risks to public order,” said Peter Holla, Amsterdam’s police chief, in a reference to a 1938 anti-Jewish pogrom in Germany.</p><p>The violence appeared to be the product of multiple combustible forces in Europe: a rise in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/magazine/anti-semitism-germany.html" title="">antisemitism</a> on the continent, the charged atmosphere and unrest that can accompany top-flight soccer matches and tensions over the yearlong Israeli military offensive in Gaza that followed the deadly Hamas attack on Israel.</p><p>That issue has been on display in European soccer already this week. In France on Tuesday, supporters of Paris St.-Germain unveiled a 50-meter-long banner reading “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/psg-escape-uefa-sanctions-after-fans-display-free-palestine-banner-2024-11-07/#:~:text=Last%20year%2C%20Scottish%20club%20Celtic,in%20the%20Stade%20de%20France." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Free Palestine</a>” at their Champions League match. And in Turkey on Thursday, fans of one of Istanbul’s biggest teams did the same.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said that he had spoken with his Dutch counterpart, Dick Schoof, after the violence. Mr. Schoof, <a href="https://x.com/MinPres/status/1854768172211065248" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a social media post</a> early Friday, condemned what he said were “completely unacceptable antisemitic attacks on Israelis.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Schoof and other Dutch officials vowed to track down and prosecute anyone involved. The mayor of Amsterdam, Femke Halsema, said at a news conference that the violence “has nothing to do with protest, or demonstration — it was a crime.”</p><p>“Hateful, antisemitic rioters and criminals harassed and beat up Israeli visitors who were guests in our city,” she added.</p><p>Gideon Saar, Israel’s newly appointed foreign minister, traveled to the Netherlands on Friday to meet with his Dutch counterpart as well as with Israelis and members of the Jewish community.</p><p>Videos circulating on social media and a video distributed by The Associated Press provided a glimpse of the tensions in the hours before the game. In the A.P. clip, dozens of men wearing scarves with the colors of Maccabi are seen gathering on Thursday at Amsterdam’s central Dam Square, where flares are being lit amid a heavy police presence.</p><p>Ten people were arrested there before the game, the police said, mostly on charges of disrupting public order.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>At a pro-Palestinian protest in another part of the city, about 30 people were arrested on charges of disrupting public order and setting off fireworks at the police, the police said.</p><p>Videos on social media after the match showed violent clashes on the city’s streets. One <a href="https://x.com/iAnnetnl/status/1854664685469028610" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> verified by Reuters captured a crowd of more than a dozen men appearing to attack someone near the city center early Friday. The crowd dispersed when emergency sirens could be heard.</p><p>“Mobs chanted anti-Israel slogans and proudly shared videos of their violent acts on social media — kicking, beating, even running over Israeli citizens,” the Israeli embassy in the Netherlands said on <a href="https://x.com/IsraelinNL/status/1854773621249786333" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a>.</p><p>As the attacks went on, Israel warned its citizens in Amsterdam to stay off the streets and remain in their hotel rooms. Maccabi Tel Aviv warned its fans not to show Israeli or Jewish symbols outside, and to fly back to Israel as soon as they could.</p><p>Isaac Herzog, Israel’s president, <a href="https://x.com/Isaac_Herzog/status/1854771676891791407" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a> that the images and videos of the violence were of the sort that “we had hoped never to see again.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Europe has experienced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/world/europe/europe-antisemitism-israel-hamas.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CFrance%20is%20seeing%20a%20wave,have%20surged%20since%20the%20Oct." title="">an increase in antisemitic incidents</a> in the wake of the Hamas attack on Israel a year ago that sparked Israel’s devastating war in Gaza, and tensions about the war have already surfaced in event as diverse as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/world/olympics/paris-olympics-israel-soccer.html" title="">the Olympics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/arts/music/october-rain-israel-eurovision.html#:~:text=At%20this%20year&#39;s%20Eurovision%2C%20Israel,Hamas%20is%20holding%20in%20Gaza." title="">the Eurovision song contest</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/books/frankfurt-book-fair-israel-war-adania-shibli.html" title="">the Frankfurt Book Fair</a>. </p><p>Earlier this year, when the Netherlands opened a National Holocaust Museum — almost 80 years after three-quarters of the Dutch Jewish population was killed in the Holocaust — an angry crowd of pro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered outside and yelled, “There is a holocaust in Gaza.”</p><p>Yet anti-Arab sentiment has persisted in Europe as well. Geert Wilders, the head of the biggest party in the Dutch Parliament and known for anti-Muslim vitriol, wrote on social media after the attacks on Israeli fans that he was “ashamed that this can happen in the Netherlands.” Using incendiary language in both English and Dutch, he demanded that “criminal Muslims” be deported, and criticized the government for not doing enough to protect the Israeli fans.</p><p>Investigators are now combing through public CCTV feeds, and they have asked witnesses to share any videos they filmed during the attacks.</p><p><strong>“</strong>We are in the process of laying out the facts and investigating antisemitic motives,” Mr. Holla, the police chief, said at the news conference.</p><p>King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands spoke with Mr. Herzog on Friday morning.</p><p>“Our history has taught us how intimidation goes from bad to worse, with horrific consequences,” the king said in a statement.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Qasim Nauman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Nadav Gavrielov<!-- -->, <!-- -->Johnatan Reiss<!-- -->, <!-- -->Nader Ibrahim<!-- -->, <!-- -->David F.
