Mr. Musk is estimated to have lost roughly $31 billion since Mr. Trump’s tariff announcement, according to the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg Billionaires Index</a>.</p><p>The feud between two of Mr. Trump’s top advisers has played out on social media for days as the administration’s new tariffs have caused huge losses across global financial markets. Among staff at the White House, Mr. Musk’s latest attacks on Mr. Navarro generated more laughs than concern, according to multiple officials who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>So far, Mr. Trump has not weighed in on the spat between his top aides, both of whom he holds in high regard. Mr. Navarro was a senior official on trade issues during Mr. Trump’s first term and remained loyal to the president afterward, even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/us/politics/peter-navarro-prison-convention.html" title="">spending four months in jail</a> after being convicted of contempt of Congress for refusing to testify in its investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.</p><p>Mr. Musk’s criticism is notable because of how rarely he breaks with Mr. Trump since enmeshing himself in the president’s inner circle. Mr. Musk often travels with him to Florida on weekends, though he was not part of the president’s entourage last weekend.</p><p>Mr. Musk has spent the past several days criticizing Mr. Navarro and publicly airing his disagreement over Mr. Trump’s tariffs. He chastised Mr. Navarro for having a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard, writing that was “a bad thing, not a good thing” and then posted that Mr. Navarro “ain’t built” anything, using an expletive. (He later deleted the second post.)</p><p>Mr. Musk, the world’s wealthiest man and a top adviser to the president, has called for “zero tariffs” between the United States and Europe, rejecting Mr. Trump’s approach.</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Navarro, a strident trade hawk, said on CNBC that he had not yet spoken with Mr. Musk but downplayed any tension.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Everything is good with Elon,” Mr. Navarro said. On Sunday, he had downplayed the tension by suggesting Mr. Musk was simply protecting his interests like any business executive would do.</p><p>Mr. Musk often uses his X account to barrage his critics, insulting them and inciting his nearly 219 million followers to join in. He has rarely been held accountable for his inflammatory posts. Since acquiring Twitter and renaming it X, Mr. Musk has often targeted judges who try to hold him or his companies to account. And in recent months, Mr. Musk lashed out at judges who have slowed or halted his federal cost-cutting efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency.</p><p>Kate Conger<!-- --> and <!-- -->Maggie Haberman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tyler Pager is a White House correspondent for The Times, covering President Trump and his administration.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/x-formerly-twitter">X (Formerly Twitter)</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/peter-navarro">Peter Navarro</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Gun Control </strong><strong>Roll Back</strong><strong>: </strong>The Trump administration is expected to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/politics/trump-gun-control-measures.html">roll back a range of Biden-era gun control measures</a>, according to two people briefed on the move.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.-Iran Talks:</strong> Expected talks between Iran and the United States would be a late, and perhaps last, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/europe/iran-nuclear-sanctions-trump.html">opportunity to control Tehran’s nuclear ambitions</a> and avoid war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drilling and Mining on Public Land:</strong> The Trump administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/climate/trump-new-mexico-nevada-mining-drilling.html">opened thousands of acres of land in Nevada and New Mexico</a> to oil and gas drilling, geothermal development and hard-rock mining, reversing protections that former President Biden enacted.</p></li><li><p><strong>Harriet Tubman:</strong> A National Park Service web page about the Underground Railroad appeared to have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/national-park-service-harriet-tubman-underground-railroad-dei.html">restored to prominently show the abolitionist leader</a>, after it had been changed to remove a large photo and quotations from her.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tech C.E.O.s and Trump: </strong>With inauguration donations and Mar-a-Lago visits, leaders of the biggest tech companies sought favor with the president in an attempt to steer regulation and tariffs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/technology/tech-ceos-lobbying-trump.html">to little avail</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Female Military Leader Fired:</strong> The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/politics/trump-us-military-nato-official-fired-chatfield.html">fired Vice Adm.
