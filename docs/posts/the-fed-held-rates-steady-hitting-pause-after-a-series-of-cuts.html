Powell signaled his support for additional cuts eventually, but was clear that “strong” growth and a “solid” labor market meant the central bank could take its time. Mr. Powell described the Fed’s policy settings as “meaningfully restrictive”, suggesting that interest rates remained at a level that was weighing on growth and aiding its efforts to bring inflation down. He also hinted that the ongoing rise in U.S. government bond yields was helping </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Still, the bar for additional reductions appears high, with Powell saying that the would need to see “real progress on inflation or some weakness in the labor market before we consider making adjustments”.</p><p>Officials at the Fed are trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that high inflation is fully vanquished after the worst shock in decades while also safeguarding the labor market from weakening excessively. Lowering interest rates too slowly risks jeopardizing jobs, whereas lowering interest rates too quickly risks inflation getting stuck above the Fed’s 2 percent goal. Powell on Wednesday said those risks still appeared to be in balance.</p><p>Angst about the labor market that emerged over the summer has abated as businesses continue to hire and layoffs remain low. But progress on taming price pressures has been bumpy in recent months. The concern is that it may get even bumpier given President Trump’s plans to dramatically reshape economic policy in his second term in the White House, including through a much more liberal use of tariffs and mass deportations.</p><p>What is unclear is how those policies will affect inflation and growth and in turn when and by how much the Fed will be able to lower interest rates again. Powell was careful not to comment directly about Trump or the potential economic impact of his policies, despite facing repeated questions from reporters. </p><p>“We need to let those policies be articulated before we can even begin to make a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be,” he said when asked about tariffs. He did acknowledge, however, that uncertainty about tariffs risked causing businesses to retrench and pull back on investment, as was the case during Trump’s first administration when trade tensions flared.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At another point, he said: “I’m not going to have any response or comment whatsoever on what the president said”.</p><p>Inflation remains the foremost concern for the Fed, despite better-than-expected data last month that suggested underlying prices pressures were coming until control.</p><p>In December, officials scaled back their forecasts for rate cuts for this year to just a half a percentage point — half of what they estimated in September — as they sharply raised their inflation projections for the year. That reflected potential policy changes from Mr. Trump for some officials, Mr Powellsaid at the time, while others revised their outlooks based on the state of the economy alone.</p><p>Key to how the Fed will respond to price pressures caused by tariffs, for example, is how expectations from consumers and businesses about future inflation shift as a result. The central bank proved to be more concerned about the potential hit to growth caused by trade tensions during Mr. Trump’s first term — so much so that it lowered interest rates — but that was because inflation was consistently below not above its goal as it is today.</p><p>Powell on Wednesday sought to allay concerns that consumers and households were becoming more concerned about inflation following a recent rise in expectations of future inflation by some metrics. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“You see expectations moving up a little bit at the short-end but not at the long-end, where it really matters,” he said. </p><p>Mr. Trump’s top economic advisers, including newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have pushed back on the idea that tariffs will cause higher consumer prices on the grounds that increased costs to U.S. importers would in part be offset by a stronger dollar. Mr. Bessent also expects foreign manufacturers to slash prices in order to stay competitive with U.S. firms, which would further insulate consumers.</p><p>Mr. Trump has made squashing inflation a central pillar of his economic agenda, and said last week that as his policies lower oil prices, he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”</p><p>Mr. Trump repeatedly attacked Mr. Powell during his first term for failing to lower interest rates fast enough. At one point, he questioned if the Fed chair was a “bigger enemy” to the U.S. than China’s president Xi Jinping.</p><p>Speaking at a New York Times event in December, Mr. Powell said he was “not concerned” about the Fed maintaining its political independence. </p><p>“Don’t look for us to do anything else”, Powell said on Wednesday when pressed if the Fed would continue to operate independent of politics.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/federal-reserve-the-fed">Federal Reserve (The Fed)</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/jerome-powell">Jerome Powell</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
