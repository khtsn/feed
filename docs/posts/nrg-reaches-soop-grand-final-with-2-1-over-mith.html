		<p>NRG Esports has defeated Made in Thailand 2-1 in the SOOP Valorant League semifinal. NRG will next play against either DRX or Gen.G in their second off-season grand final. MiTH has been eliminated from the tournament, going out in the top four after taking wins against Sentinels and Talon Esports.</p>

<p>The match began with a MiTH map win, taking Haven 13-10. Pearl went NRG&#39;s way, another 13-10 win to send the series to the decider. A quick Ascent concluded the match, with NRG winning 13-5 after a dominant defense.</p>

			<p>+1 he didneverything he needed, just at his own pace. Every time he had sova ult he played far and got like 1 kill and forced 1 guy to int away his life cquse he was putting on so much pressure. He worked main really well with mada, basically giving nothing to the defenders whilst taking control. He caught lurks on defence etc.</p>
<p>He plays the good kind of passive that comes from a really good understanding of what he needs to do and confidence in himself to win key fighta, not just being scared of taking fights</p>		</div>
