</span> 2-1 in the first <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/425353/made-in-thailand-vs-nrg-esports-soop-valorant-league-sf/?game=all&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">semifinal</a> of the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2225/soop-valorant-league/playoffs" target="_blank">SOOP Valorant League</a>. NRG will next play against <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/425354/drx-vs-gen-g-soop-valorant-league-sf" target="_blank">either DRX or Gen.G</a> in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/425355/nrg-esports-vs-tbd-soop-valorant-league-gf" target="_blank">grand final</a>, their <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/417835/nrg-esports-vs-sentinels-sen-city-classic-gf" target="_blank">second grand final</a> this off-season. MiTH has been eliminated from the tournament, going out in the top four after <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/429708/soop-valorant-league-reaches-final-four" target="_blank">taking wins against Sentinels and Talon Esports</a>.</p>

<p>The match began on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/425353/made-in-thailand-vs-nrg-esports-soop-valorant-league-sf/?game=194166&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Haven</a>, with <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/21668/verno">

</span> cleaning up the pistol and anti-eco rounds to open the map. Three separate 4Ks followed, with MiTH getting on the board thanks to <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/24679/cgrs">
		cgrs	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/8582/laz">
		Laz	</a>
</span>, while Verno remained on the killfeed to grant his team a tie at 3-3. He continued being key to his team&#39;s success, setting up a post-plant that returned NRG to the lead. MiTH&#39;s retakes put them up 5-4, but NRG quickly equalized following a timeout. The half remained close, ending with a tied score ahead of the break.</p>

<p>A quick pistol round went MiTH&#39;s way, and they were able to win a 3v5 to slow the back-and-forth down and remain in the lead. The North American squad&#39;s economy forced them onto a semi-eco and a pair of half-buys, letting MiTH reach match point despite NRG closing the score gap. A tactical pause from MiTH led to a comfortable final round, ending the map 13-10 and marking MiTH&#39;s fifth map win against a VCT partnership team in this tournament.</p>

<p>MiTH opened their map pick, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/425353/made-in-thailand-vs-nrg-esports-soop-valorant-league-sf/?game=194167&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Pearl</a>, with a pistol round win. A close bonus round went NRG&#39;s way, but <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/12098/kadoom">
		Kadoom	</a>
</span> extended his team&#39;s lead with a collateral Operator kill. NRG continued testing A after a timeout, closing the gap and leading to MiTH&#39;s own pause after an eco round. Undeterred, Kadoom and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/13784/killua">
		Killua	</a>
</span> helped put MiTH back in the lead, ending the half 7-5. </p>

<p>NRG averted a potential disaster with a pistol win, seemingly more comfortable on the defense. They took the lead in the bonus round, and MiTH&#39;s low economy helped NRG set the score 9-7 and force a timeout from their opponents. <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/5132/mada">
		mada	</a>
</span> opened the following round to help his team reach double digits, but cgrs countered by stopping a nearly-successful NRG retake. His efforts were not enough, however, as a Verno 3K forced MiTH into an eco-round. NRG reached match point, but was denied twice by their opponents. In the end, <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/11225/ethan">
		Ethan	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/817/finesse">
		FiNESSE	</a>
</span> led a retake to convert a 3v3, ending the map 13-10 and sending the series to a decider. </p>

<p>Heading into the decider, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/425353/made-in-thailand-vs-nrg-esports-soop-valorant-league-sf/?game=194168&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Ascent</a>, NRG was unstoppable. The NA team took the pistol after a retake, and was able to confirm a close bonus round by denying info to MiTH&#39;s remaining players. A flawless anti-eco prompted MiTH&#39;s first timeout of the decider, which in turn helped the Thai lineup win their first point. </p>

<p>NRG remained confident, however, winning the next three rounds and forcing out MiTH&#39;s second pause at 7-1. MiTH was unable to find a gap in the defense until round 11, with cgrs and Kadoom shutting down NRG&#39;s retake attempt. NRG recovered quickly once again, as Ethan held an advanced position to catch MiTH&#39;s A push off-guard. MiTH kept their hopes up in the second half with a pistol win, but NRG punished an over-eager defense to take the bonus. Another patient attack put NRG at match point, and Ethan helped seal the decider 13-5 with a triple kill. </p>

<p>Ethan was optimistic about his team&#39;s performance. “[It was a] slow start, but everyone&#39;s playing really well,” he said after the series. “The comms were good. “</p>

<p>“Everyone is getting used to each other,” he added. “We&#39;re getting to know what everyone likes to do. We&#39;re meshing pretty well.”</p>

<p>He also commented on the grand final matchup. “We&#39;re excited to play a Korean team. DRX is a little more flashy, Gen.G is really good.”</p>
