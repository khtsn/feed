</span> placing higher than them at the event, DRG entered the tournament as favorites with a target on their backs. Primed to challenge them were Rare Atom, who led the circuit point standings by a wide margin, and Any Questions Gaming, who featured 2024 world champion <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/13768/s1mon">
		S1Mon	</a>
</span> on their roster. </p>

<p>The group stage divided the eight teams into two double-elimination groups. Placed into opposite groups, the two grand finalists of DRG and Rare Atom stormed through their respective upper brackets in 2-0 fashion, neither dropping a map in the process. </p>

<p>The last two playoff spots were filled by Octagonal Disposition Gaming, who won a rematch against Zhu Chao Gaming in the group decider after losing to them in their opening game, and AQG, who defeated Ambitious Legend Gaming to qualify.</p>



<p>Playoffs kicked off with Rare Atom <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/569523/rare-atom-vs-octagonal-disposition-gaming-vct-2025-china-ascension-ubsf" target="_blank">comfortably defeating</a> ODG to progress to the upper final and continue their undefeated run. The <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/569524/dragon-ranger-gaming-vs-any-questions-gaming-vct-2025-china-ascension-ubsf" target="_blank">next match</a> was a major upset, with AQG defeating DRG in a close 13-11, 14-12 series to send them down to the lower bracket. <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/58959/iamgrq">

</span> and <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/32183/dannyy">

</span> each had an impressive series, both  going +18.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/569525/rare-atom-vs-any-questions-gaming-vct-2025-china-ascension-ubf" target="_blank">upper final</a>, Rare Atom swept AQG in yet another 2-0, not dropping a single map all the way to their third consecutive Ascension grand final. Their primary Duelist <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/49476/zhe">
		zhe	</a>
</span>, who was the statistical star for his team all event, put up a tremendous performance, going 21/6/2 in the first map of Sunset to lead his team to a 13-3 win. He ended the series +23, with a 43/20/5 KDA and 306 ACS.</p>

<p>Down in the lower bracket, DRG&#39;s experience shone through with a straightforward 13-3, 13-7 <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/569527/octagonal-disposition-gaming-vs-dragon-ranger-gaming-vct-2025-china-ascension-lr1" target="_blank">stomp</a> over ODG to eliminate them from the tournament and set themselves up for a rematch against AQG in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/569528/any-questions-gaming-vs-dragon-ranger-gaming-vct-2025-china-ascension-lbf" target="_blank">lower final</a>. </p>

<p>It seemed like exacting revenge would be a simple task for DRG as they opened the best-of-five series with 13-6 and 13-5 map wins, but AQG refused to give up easily, threatening a reverse sweep with a 13-11 on Haven and an impressive 13-5 showing on Abyss. The last map came down to Lotus, where DRG won 13-7 to deny the reverse sweep and book their tickets to a decisive grand final against Rare Atom.</p>

<p>The last time DRG and Rare Atom had faced off was the grand final of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1927/champions-tour-2023-china-ascension" target="_blank">China Ascension 2023</a>, where DRG won 3-1 to ascend to VCT for the first time, albeit with very different rosters on both sides. This time, DRG displayed their caliber as a team, trouncing Rare Atom in a 3-0 that included a 13-1 win on their permaban of Bind, where they fielded <span data-ref-id="15">

<p><em>SpiritZ1 cleans up Rare Atom as Reyna with a smooth 4K.</em></p>

<p>With this win, DRG has obtained another Ascension trophy, earned the right to return to VCT, and delivered Rare Atom a third second-place finish in China Ascension. Statistically, SpiritZ1 led the event by a sizable margin with 261 ACS, 0.94 KPR, and a 1.29 K:D and was awarded the title of tournament MVP.</p>
