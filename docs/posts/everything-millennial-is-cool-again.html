Those Facebook albums of blurry photos of a night out? They’re back, repackaged as an Instagram “photo dump.” Ditto for big hair and wired headphones.</p><p>“I do like seeing how a younger generation interprets an older trend when it comes back around,” said Erin Miller, 35, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@overthemoonfaraway?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a TikTok creator</a> and self-proclaimed 1990s and 2000s historian. She wasn’t surprised that many trends loved by millennials were making a comeback. “Does it remind me of my age? Yes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But that’s not to say everything is the same. Millennials (typically those born from the early 1980s to the late ’90s) had infomercials and mail-order. Gen Z and Alpha have TikTok makeup tutorials and fast fashion. Bradshaw’s cosmopolitan has been exchanged for an Aperol spritz.</p><p>Members of generations Z and Alpha are putting their own mark on once-ubiquitous phenomena, and according to Ms. Miller, they’re the winners: “I think they are doing it better.”</p><p>We’re just happy that our trends have held up so well — enjoy them, Gen Z, you’ll be criticized by a younger generation before you know it.</p><p>Here are 11 millennial trends that are being revived.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-NaN">👱‍♀️</h2><h2 id="link-46f6f200">Big Hair</h2><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/melina-delkic"><img alt="Melina Delkic" title="Melina Delkic" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/05/multimedia/author-melina-delkic/author-melina-delkic-thumbLarge.png"/></a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="CardDeckBlock-5"><div data-testid="cardDeck"><figure data-slug="06xp-millennials-BigHair"><div><div></div><div></div></div><figcaption>Carrie Underwood in 2007 and Beyoncé in 2024.</figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Big hair isn’t a fad; it’s a lifestyle.</p><p>Just look at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DollyParton/posts/the-higher-the-hair-the-closer-to-heaven-%EF%B8%8F/873818414108329/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dolly Parton</a> or Beyoncé.</p><p>But there are periods when the big hair gets, well, bigger.

It reached Oprah and Ellen and was sold at Sally Beauty Supply, Claire’s and Walmart. Ms. Bennett and her family, who helped with the business, sold 10 million Bumpits in three years at the peak of the business, she said.</p><p>The business slowed as straighter, less tousled hairstyles took over. But Ms. Bennett, now 62 and living in Cambria, Calif., is seeing a resurgence of the hairstyles of the early 2000s.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Flat hair is out; big hair is in,” she said.</p><p>Ms. Atkin agreed: “I just saw Beyoncé’s ‘Cowboy Carter’ show and it’s all about big, sculptural glam,” she said. “Off the stage, ’90s layered cuts are everywhere, which add volume and shape.” (A headline earlier this year noted the return of <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/beauty/bumpit-ponytails-were-everywhere-at-the-golden-globes-here-s-how-to-get-the-look/ar-AA1x45Dl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Bumpit-style ponytails”</a> seen on Nicole Kidman and Angelina Jolie, among others, at the Golden Globes.)</p><p>Whatever your chosen hairstyle or method for giving it some lift, both Ms. Bennett and Ms. Atkin suggest finding what works best for you.</p><p>As Ms. Bennett put it, “If your hair is good, your day is good.”</p><h2 id="link-NaN">👠</h2><h2 id="link-5d03d898">‘Sex and the City’</h2><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/claire-moses"><img alt="Claire Moses" title="Claire Moses" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/01/reader-center/author-claire-moses/author-claire-moses-thumbLarge.png"/></a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="CardDeckBlock-10"><div data-testid="cardDeck"><figure data-slug="06xp-millennials-SATC"><div><div></div><div></div></div><figcaption>Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), left, modeled one of her most memorable looks, a Dior newsprint dress, during an infamous apology scene on “Sex and the City.” The actress Jenna Ortega wore the dress to the premiere of the film “Hurry Up Tomorrow” in New York last month.</figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Much about the lifestyles on “Sex and the City” has been rendered obsolete. Landlines. Answering machines. A weekly newspaper column. Whole milk.</p><p>So why is Gen Z so into the show?</p><p>“It’s really like a time capsule,” said Elisa Zuritsky, a longtime writer on “Sex and the City” and now on the sequel series “And Just Like That.” “There’s an awareness of what was lost.”</p><p>Carrie Bradshaw, the show’s protagonist, also remains an aspirational figure. On TikTok, users have reminded people that if you’re 32, you’re only in Season 1 of “Sex and the City.” Carrie is a reminder that you don’t need to have your whole life figured out at that age. The best is yet to come.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Now, New York City is filled with a new generation of 20-somethings who are living out their best “Sex and the City” fantasies. (<a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/nyc-west-village-neighborhood-new-generation-women-girls.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Cut recently deemed</a> them “West Village Girls.”)</p><p>The best part of that lifestyle — besides the clothes and the romance — may just be Carrie’s friendships. “That is the real fantasy, not all the sex they were having,” said Julie Rottenberg, another longtime “Sex and the City” writer. “How do these busy women have time to sit down and have coffee?”</p><p>Carrie is also deeply flawed, Ms. Rottenberg said. “Those are the best characters,” she said. “Those are the ones who get under our skin. Who infuriate us or activate us. Who allow us to feel less alone.”</p><p>That connection to the characters is what many young people still feel when watching the show.</p><p>“There’s an authenticity inside of it and I think that will always be fresh,” said Jason Lewis, who played Smith, one of Samantha’s love interests. “We may always push back against the ideas of the generations before us, but when we find something authentic, it’s easy to connect to.”</p><h2 id="link-NaN">🎧</h2><h2 id="link-6b1fffd3">Wired Headphones</h2><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gina-cherelus"><img alt="Gina Cherelus" title="Gina Cherelus" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/09/reader-center/author-gina-cherelus/author-gina-cherelus-thumbLarge.png"/></a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="CardDeckBlock-14"><div data-testid="cardDeck"><section aria-label="Gallery" data-testid="Gallery"><div><ol><li><figure><p><span>2005</span></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure><span>Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span></li><li><figure><p><span>2025</span></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure><span>305pics/GC Images</span></li><li><figure><p><span>2006</span></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure><span>Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></li><li><figure><p><span>2024</span></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure><span>Adek Berry/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></li><li><figure><p><span>2005</span></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure><span>Ozier Muhammad/The New York Times</span></li><li><figure><p><span>2025</span></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure><span>Moritz Scholz/Getty Images</span></li></ol></div><nav><span></span></nav></section></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>You pull your headphones out of your bag only to find a string of tangles and knots.

In hand? A craft beer, naturally.

And casual, as the word suggests, is the point of the photo dump: a glut of snapshots, often shared on Instagram.</p><p>Photo dumps might catalog a vacation or a month of concerts, or they could have a visual theme. But though they can take care and time to create, the impression is supposed to be “intentionally unfiltered,” Ms. Koong said. “People like to use it to make it look so effortless. Like: ‘I barely tried. It’s just my coffee.’”</p><p>Last year, Instagram expanded its carousel posts to allow 20 photos. “I think it has a wide appeal and it will stick around for a little while,” Ms. Koong said.</p><p>I go back to the archives, cringing, to flick through old Facebook albums, hundreds of photos crammed under titles like “spring breakers,” “road trip” and, inexplicably, “turn up the love.”</p><p>But the less curated a photo dump is, the more entertaining it can be, according to Ms. Koong. “Those are my favorite co-workers to stalk,” she says with a laugh.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><h2 id="link-NaN">👯‍♀️</h2><h2 id="link-15064848">Choreographed Dances</h2><div><div><div><p><img alt="Brent Lewis" title="Brent Lewis" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/05/multimedia/author-brent-lewis/author-brent-lewis-thumbLarge.png"/></p></div></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-34"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/arts/DanceTrends_H/DanceTrends_H-superJumbo.png" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Soulja Boy set off one of the first dance crazes of the digital era.

Even oversize scrunchies, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=215558490184856" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">once mocked for being thoroughly uncool</a>, are making their way to red carpets.</p><p>“It doesn’t need to be a full crazy look,” said Haley Heckmann, 31, a hairstylist in Los Angeles. “You can enhance a look as effortless with something simple.”</p><p>The approach follows a general less-is-more vibe for Gen Z and younger generations. Hair accessories offer that flair and a chance to personalize, Ms. Heckmann said.</p><p>The mix has landed a millennial mainstay front and center once again: Claire’s, once a must-visit for first piercings and affordable accessories, is experiencing a renaissance of sorts as colorful clips and zigzag headbands (ouch!) make their way back into hair routines.</p><p>It’s less about what accessory Gen Z is reaching for and more about “how they’re wearing it and how they’re feeling about it,” said Alisha Chadha, the senior vice president for global merchandising at Claire’s.</p><p>One of the most popular items at C.O. Bigelow, the oldest apothecary in New York City, is the humble tortoiseshell headband, which came off dusty shelves in the basement when TikTok users discovered it had been the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/style/carolyn-bessette-kennedy-headband-fashion.html" title="">go-to accessory</a> for Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, an original fashion influencer of the 1990s whose style has come back with younger generations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-21"><div><p>Whimsical claw clips also bring in younger customers. When Carolina DelRio, C.O. Bigelow’s general manager, first started working at the store 14 years ago, “it was just very classic, boring pieces; everything was brown or black, berets or headbands,” she said. Now, they practically have a garden of clips on display.</p><p>“New Yorkers, we wear black, brown and beige a lot,” she said. “A pop of color adds something to the outfit.”</p><h2 id="link-NaN">📀</h2><h2 id="link-31ea4fd">Physical Media</h2><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sara-ruberg"><img alt="Sara Ruberg" title="Sara Ruberg" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/14/reader-center/author-sara-ruberg/author-sara-ruberg-thumbLarge-v4.png"/></a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="CardDeckBlock-44"><div data-testid="cardDeck"><figure data-slug="06xp-millennials-Album-Covers"><div><div></div><div></div></div><figcaption>The eras of CDs: from Beyoncé’s 2003 “Dangerously in Love” and Taylor Swift’s 2006 self-titled album to Beyoncé’s 2024 “Cowboy Carter” and Taylor Swift’s “Tortured Poets Department” the same year.</figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-22"><div><p>In a world where streaming services for music and movies are the norm, some young people are digging through thrift store bins to find their favorite works on DVD, VHS, CD and cassette.</p><p>On TikTok, people <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/physicalmedia?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">praise one another</a> in the comments for color-coordinated DVD shelves or for snagging used silver CD players from Goodwill.
