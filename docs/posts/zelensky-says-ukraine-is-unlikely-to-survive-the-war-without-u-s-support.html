    <h1>Zelensky Says Ukraine Is Unlikely to Survive the War Without U.S. Support</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier in the week, Pete Hegseth, Mr. Trump’s defense secretary, jolted Kyiv and European allies of Ukraine by saying in a meeting with NATO and Ukrainian defense ministers in Brussels that the United States did not support Ukraine’s desire to join NATO as part of a peace plan. He also described a return to Ukraine’s borders before 2014 — when Russia annexed Crimea — as “unrealistic.”</p><p>Mr. Trump has repeatedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html" title="">suggested trading U.S. aid for Ukraine’s critical minerals</a>, telling <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6368624897112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fox News</a> earlier this month that he wanted “the equivalent of like $500 billion worth of rare earths,” a group of minerals crucial for many high-tech products, in exchange for American aid. Ukraine had “essentially agreed to do that,” he said.</p><p>In Munich, the Ukrainian president did get to make his case while sitting across a table on Friday from Mr. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Keith Kellogg, the retired general who is Trump’s envoy for Ukraine and Russia.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky asked for “security guarantees.” Mr. Vance stressed the importance of beginning conversations about ending the war in Ukraine but declined to discuss specifics, he said, to preserve negotiators’ options.</p><p>“Fundamentally the goal is, as President Trump outlined it, we want the war to come to a close, we want the killing to stop,” Mr. Vance said. “But we want to achieve a durable, lasting peace.”</p></div></div>
