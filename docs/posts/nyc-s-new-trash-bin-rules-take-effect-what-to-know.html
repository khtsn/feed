data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>A new era has dawned for New York City’s garbage.</p><p>The trash from private homes and small apartment buildings now must be put out for collection in bins with lids, the city says — preferably the official “NYC Bins” sold by the Sanitation Department.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/dsny/collection/containerization/nyc-bin-faq.page" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new rules</a>, which went into effect Tuesday and will be phased in with a brief “warning period” for slow adopters, herald the end of the city’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/02/upshot/nyc-trash-rules.html" title="">peculiar, decades-old tradition</a> of letting residents place their bulging garbage bags directly on the sidewalk, where they provide an endless feast for rats.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know about the city’s new trash collection rules:</p><h2 id="link-4f9e78b8">Who needs to start putting their garbage in trash bins?</h2><p>People who own buildings with fewer than 10 residential units, including single-family homes. (The landlords, not the tenants, are responsible for making sure the buildings have trash bins.) The rules also apply to various buildings where trash is collected by the city rather than by private haulers, including houses of worship, some nonprofits and professional offices in residential buildings.</p><h2 id="link-4501e0da">What if I already have my own trash bin?</h2><p>You can use it for now, as long as it has a secure lid and holds 55 gallons or fewer. But by June 2026, you must use the official NYC Bin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-61c543e">How do I get an official NYC Bin, and how much does it cost?</h2><p>Go to <a href="https://www.bins.nyc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bins.nyc</a> and order one. The 45-gallon size, which holds up to four kitchen garbage bags, costs $54.60 including a $1.59 “processing fee,” plus tax. The 35-gallon model, which holds up to three bags, costs $47.26 including a $1.38 processing fee, plus tax.</p><p>The city says it is selling the bins “at a significantly lower price than similar bins at retail stores.” This assertion is debatable — <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/pep/HDX-45-Gal-Black-Outdoor-Vented-Trash-Can-with-Wheels-Attached-Lid-Rounded-Handles-and-Reinforced-Foothold-999-2445W/330264350" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Home Depot offers</a> a comparable 45-gallon bin for $37.97 — but you have to eventually switch to an NYC Bin anyway.</p><p>The city says that it has sold nearly 400,000 bins since July, though that includes its official recycling and compost bins.</p><h2 id="link-1b3719df">Wait, do I have to buy the city’s official recycling and compost bins, too?</h2><p>No. But they are also available at <a href="https://www.bins.nyc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bins.nyc</a>.</p><h2 id="link-1d77d770">What if I persist in putting my trash bags on the sidewalk?</h2><p>Starting on Jan. 2, you can be fined $50 for the first offense, $100 for the second offense and $200 for the third and any subsequent offenses.</p><h2 id="link-17051cd9">I’m a landlord of a nine-unit building. How many bins do I need?</h2><p>“Enough bins to accommodate all trash” produced by the building, the city says.</p><h2 id="link-36fd5adb">What about buildings with 10 or more units?</h2><p>Their time is coming. Starting next spring, the city will roll out containerization rules for larger apartment buildings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-5ce0b1e4">Do I need to line my bins with a bag?</h2><p>No, but it can help keep the bin clean.</p><h2 id="link-2e7f5c4d">How do I get rid of my old trash bins?</h2><p>You can recycle them. Simply place the bins upside-down on the sidewalk on recycling night.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andy Newman writes about New Yorkers facing difficult situations, including homelessness, poverty and mental illness.
