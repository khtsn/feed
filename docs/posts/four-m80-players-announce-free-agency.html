</span>, who was on the opposite side of the 2023 grand final as a player on The Guard, announced his unrestricted free agency two days after the grand final. He said that he is “Looking to play sentinel/controller, I am very vocal, and I can co-IGL defense. Willing to relocate to any region.”</p>

</span> were on last year&#39;s M80 roster before being signed by their current teams. As of the writing of this article, only one player survives that roster. </p>

<p>“[I] can play any duelist and excel at OPing at a top-tier level,” said koalanoob, who fans will remember for his 2024 Ascension grand finals-leading 81-kill performance. ”[I] can play all smoke agents, Chamber/Sage and I&#39;m willing to learn and flex any role needed to make the team succeed.”</p>

<p>NiSMO, who had been with M80 for the past two years, also announced his unrestricted free agency.</p>

<p>“Grateful for the journey with the boys, I wish all of them the best,” he said. “Very grateful to have been a part of this squad &amp; Organization! Now it&#39;s time to find a new home and I&#39;m more motivated than ever. Willing to play Any Initiator/Sentinel/Flex Duelist I&#39;m very flexible and open to IGL&#39;ing as well as I have been co-IGL&#39;ing for a while now.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/BcJFPS/status/1837687199380525228" target="_blank">post</a> following this year&#39;s grand final, BcJ said, &#34;The feeling of not knowing what comes next for my career is eating me alive.&#34; </p>

<p>As of the writing of this article, he is the most recent M80 player to announce that he is looking for a team. </p>

<p>&#34;This season was one of the hardest seasons for me not only because of the loss but because of how much hard work went into this project and us being forced to split up,&#34; he <a href="https://x.com/BcJFPS/status/1838318561573642604" target="_blank">said</a>, suggesting that the M80 roster&#39;s dispersion was inevitable. He also dispelled any rumors of him retiring from competitive Valorant, emphasizing his talents as an initiator.</p>

<p>&#34;It hurts so much that AGAIN I have to sit here and write a post about how my team (legit my second FAMILY) is getting split up due to the nature of franchising and limited player slots,&#34; he said, adding context to the reason for the team splitting up. Before joining M80, BcJ was on the <span data-ref-id="11">

<p>“I wanna be the best player in the game and I&#39;ll do anything to achieve that goal,” koalanoob said in his announcement. “I loved playing with the most amazing teammates I could ask for and it sucks we are parting ways. But I know all of them will land on their feet they deserve it.”</p>

<p>The only player remaining on M80&#39;s roster from the 2023 grand finals run and on the current roster is <span data-ref-id="12">
