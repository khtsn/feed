He was 78.</p><p>His family confirmed his death on Friday afternoon in <a href="https://x.com/CBSSportsGang/status/1872770664077443439" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a social media post</a> from CBS Sports, where Mr. Gumbel had worked since 1989. He had been diagnosed with cancer.</p><p>For decades, Mr. Gumbel served as a play-by-play announcer for CBS’s National Football League coverage. In 2001, he became <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/13/sports/football/nfl-broadcaster-boot-camp.html" title="">the first Black sportscaster in that role</a> covering a Super Bowl. He also covered the National Collegiate Athletic Association men’s basketball tournament for the network and had spent four years reporting on the American Football Conference for NBC Sports.</p><p>He got his first chance as an announcer in the early 1970s, when a boss at the NBC affiliate in Chicago, Channel 5, told him that he wanted to broadcast a high school basketball game every Saturday, as Mr. Gumbel recalled in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nd-lsWQmno" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview</a> with the sportscaster Kenny McReynolds, published in 2021.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“He said, ‘I have this idea, and I want you to take it and run with it,’” Mr. Gumbel said in the interview. “We introduced our audience to a lot of guys who went on to become famous.”</p><p>Mr. Gumbel’s career took off in the 1980s, when he began to cover the National Basketball Association. He called his first N.F.L. game in 1988.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
