He was 78.</p><p>His family confirmed his death on Friday afternoon in <a href="https://x.com/CBSSportsGang/status/1872770664077443439" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a social media post</a> from CBS Sports, where Mr. Gumbel had worked since 1989. He had been diagnosed with cancer.</p><p>For decades, Mr. Gumbel served as a play-by-play announcer for CBS’s National Football League coverage. In 2001, he became <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/13/sports/football/nfl-broadcaster-boot-camp.html" title="">the first Black sportscaster in that role</a> covering a Super Bowl. He also covered the National Collegiate Athletic Association men’s basketball tournament for the network and had spent four years reporting on the American Football Conference for NBC Sports.</p><p>He got his first chance as an announcer in the early 1970s, when a boss at the NBC affiliate in Chicago, Channel 5, told him that he wanted to broadcast a high school basketball game every Saturday, as Mr. Gumbel recalled in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nd-lsWQmno" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview</a> with the sportscaster Kenny McReynolds published in 2021.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“He said, ‘I have this idea, and I want you to take it and run with it,’” Mr. Gumbel said in the interview. “We introduced our audience to a lot of guys who went on to become famous.”</p><p>Mr. Gumbel’s career took off in the 1980s, when he began to cover the National Basketball Association. He called his first N.F.L. game in 1988.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Greg Gumbel interviewing the Dallas Cowboys’ Deion Sanders, left, and Michael Irvin after Super Bowl XXX in 1996.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ron Heflin/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Gumbel was born on May 3, 1946, in New Orleans. He said in a 2022 interview with <a href="https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2022/03/31/greg-gumbel-cbs-nfl-broadcaster-salaries" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sports Illustrated</a> that he had modeled his style on that of the sportscaster Pat Summerall, noting that he liked how Mr. Summerall “didn’t overtalk.”</p><p>At the beginning of his career, Mr. Gumbel was nervous when he was on the mic, he said. The Channel 5 crew nicknamed him “Waterfall” because of how he would sweat while he called games, according to <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2001/01/26/chicago-native-becomes-first-black-to-do-play-by-play-on-major-telecast/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Chicago Tribune</a>. But over time he became comfortable in his role, and millions of viewers came to appreciate his calm in covering games, letting the action play out without dominating the broadcast.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In an Emmy Award-winning career, Mr. Gumbel worked for NBC, ESPN and MSG Network, where he hosted the Knicks’ pregame shows. But it was at CBS where he spent most of his career, doing the play-by-play announcing for Super Bowl 35 and Super Bowl 38.</p><p>While working his second Super Bowl, in 2004, <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/news-center/2024/super-bowl-lviii-draws-123-7-million-average-viewers-largest-tv-audience-on-record/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a television audience of nearly 90 million</a> listened as the game built up to a dramatic final minute, with the New England Patriots marching down the field for a game-winning field goal.</p><p>“Looks good!” Mr. Gumbel shouted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_2j0CDNFo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as the kick went up</a>. Then he let the cheers from the crowd take over as the Patriots went up by three points with only four seconds to go.</p><p>Mr. Gumbel stuck mostly to sports, but politics slipped in when, in 1999, he declined an invitation to a NASCAR event because Justice Clarence Thomas of the Supreme Court was planning to attend, saying he did not agree with Justice Thomas’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/15/sports/auto-racing-notebook-restrictor-plate-races-are-still-martin-s-bane.html" title="">political views</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Greg Gumbel, left, and his brother Bryant Gumbel, a well-known broadcaster himself, in 2014.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images for UNICEF</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Gumbel’s survivors include his wife, Marcy; a daughter, Michelle; and his brother, Bryant Gumbel, the broadcaster and former “Today” show host.</p><p>Sheelagh McNeill<!-- --> contributed research.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.
