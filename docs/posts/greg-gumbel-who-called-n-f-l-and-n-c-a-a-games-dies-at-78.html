He was 78.</p><p>Mr. Gumbel’s family confirmed his death on Friday afternoon in a social media post from CBS Sports, where he had worked since 1989. The sports analyst had been diagnosed with cancer.</p><p>For decades, Mr. Gumbel served as a play-by-play announcer for CBS’s National Football League coverage and, in 2001, he became <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/13/sports/football/nfl-broadcaster-boot-camp.html" title="">the first Black sportscaster in that role</a> during a Super Bowl. He also covered the National Collegiate Athletic Association men’s basketball tournament for the network and had previously spent four years reporting on the American Football Conference for NBC Sports.</p><p>Mr. Gumbel got his first chance as an announcer in the early 1970s when a boss at the NBC affiliate in Chicago, Channel 5, told Mr. Gumbel that he wanted to broadcast a high school basketball game every Saturday, he said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nd-lsWQmno" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">during an interview</a>, published in 2021, with the sportscaster Kenny McReynolds, in which Mr. Gumbel reflected on his career.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“He said, ‘I have this idea and I want you to take it and run with it,’” Mr. Gumbel said in the interview. “We introduced our audience to a lot of guys who went on to become famous.”</p><p>Mr. Gumbel’s career took off in the 1980s as he began to cover the National Basketball Association and, in 1988, called his first N.F.L. game.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Greg Gumbel interviewing the Dallas Cowboys’ Deion Sanders, left, and Michael Irvin after Super Bowl XXX in 1996.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ron Heflin/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Gumbel, who according to his IMDb profile was born on May 3, 1946, in New Orleans, said in a 2022 interview with <a href="https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2022/03/31/greg-gumbel-cbs-nfl-broadcaster-salaries" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sports Illustrated</a> that he modeled his style on that of Pat Summerall, noting that he liked how Mr. Summerall “didn’t overtalk.”</p><p>At the beginning of his career, Mr. Gumbel became nervous when he was on the mic. The Channel 5 crew nicknamed him “Waterfall” because of how he used to sweat while he called games, according to <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2001/01/26/chicago-native-becomes-first-black-to-do-play-by-play-on-major-telecast/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reporting by The Chicago Tribune</a>. But over time, Mr. Gumbel became comfortable in his role, and millions of viewers came to appreciate the calm style that he brought to smoothly narrate the games, letting the action play out without his dominating the broadcast.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mr. Gumbel stuck mostly to sports in his career. But occasionally, politics slipped in. In 1999, he did not attend a NASCAR event that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was attending because he did not agree with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/15/sports/auto-racing-notebook-restrictor-plate-races-are-still-martin-s-bane.html" title="">justice’s political views</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Greg Gumbel, left, and his brother Bryant Gumbel, a well-known broadcaster himself, n 2014.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images for UNICEF</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Gumbel is survived by family members including his wife, Marcy, and daughter, Michelle, and his brother, Bryant, who is a well-known broadcaster and former “Today” show host.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.
