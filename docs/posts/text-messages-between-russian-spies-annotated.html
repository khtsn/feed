I have no money left, I have no wife while I am in my middle 30th, and my old family had lots of troubles.

They are sent into the world as a couple, partners in espionage and life. Such pairings are meant to diminish the sense of isolation that can afflict such spies during years, and sometimes decades, spent undercover, experts say.</p><p>The Shmyrevs were different. They were sent to separate countries and were apart for years. Exchanges like the one above show the challenges of operating alone. They indicate that the couple had grown frustrated with the day-to-day drudgery and, at times, with each other.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-8"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="deepcover-2" data-id="100000010177878" data-source-id="100000010177878"><div slug="deepcover-2" data-sourceid="100000010177878" id="embed-id-100000010177878">
