Both teams that started in the lower bracket fought hard, but lost close series to the teams that arrived from the upper bracket.</p>

</span> 2-0 to help get them into the Stage 2 playoffs and keep their Champions hopes alive after failing to get a VCT win in over a year.  Now, nine days later, AG had to defeat FPX once again to keep their Champs run alive.</p>

<p>This series started on Sunset, with AG using a double Controller composition to pair with Neon and Deadlock, while FPX opted for a double Duelist alongside Cypher. It was a perfect start for AG on their map pick, as they won pistol and converted the bonus to go up 4-0, highlighted by a clean ace from <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4881/spitfires">
		Spitfires	</a>
</span>. </p>


<p><em>Spitfires aces FPX on an eco round to take an early lead on Sunset. (Clip via Project Horizon)</em></p>

<p>Spitfires was the spearhead on Neon, but <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/3028/life">
		Life	</a>
</span> from FPX fought hard to help bring the half back by helping win the next five rounds in a row. Even with that hot start from AG, FPX showed resilience to enter the half tied 6-6.</p>

<p>FPX won the second pistol on Sunset to retake the lead, but after failing to convert the bonus round, AG built momentum and started to win the gun rounds. <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/25494/shr1mp">
		Shr1mp	</a>
</span> was leading the charge on the defense side, as AG won five rounds in a row to take a commanding lead that they would convert, ending the map 13-10 and a 1-0 series lead.</p>

<p>While map one was ideal for AG, map two was a reminder of who they were facing. Haven was the map pick from FPX, and both teams ran a mirror composition with Neon, double Controller, and Killjoy. FPX won the pistol round, won the bonus, and built a ton of momentum from clinical post-plants. It took seven attempts for AG to get their first spike defuse win, and even then, FPX just started another round winning streak to end the half up 11-1. It was a playground for Life and <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/872/autumn">
		Autumn	</a>
</span> as they both took space and held it near perfectly against AG.</p>

<p>The second half was only a formality, even as AG won the second pistol. FPX helped prevent that bonus round conversion, then won the next to win the map 13-3 and take the series to map three.</p>

<p>After such a one-sided loss, AG needed to keep Icebox within reach at the half, and it was yet another solo Duelist double Controller composition mirror match to decide it all. FPX won the first pistol, but AG were quick to bounce back and get ahead of the post-plant strategies that tangled them up on Haven. The defense from AG looked more sound, as <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/46748/k1ra">
		K1ra	</a>
</span> stepped up on Viper to give AG a nice 8-4 lead at the half.</p>

<p>When AG won the second pistol, it was a dire situation for FPX. The team tried to build momentum after preventing a bonus round win, but it was for naught as AG got two rounds soon after and won the final map 13-6, securing the 2-1 series win and remaining in the competition.</p>

<p>Even with that tough map two, AG pulled through thanks to Shr1mp, who led his team to get another big win over FPX. In this series, he ended it with a 1.24 match rating, 49 kills, +14, and only died 35 times in three grueling maps.</p>

<p>With this win, AG will face the losing team from <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/527580/bilibili-gaming-vs-tyloo-vct-2025-china-stage-2-ubsf" target="_blank">the Bilibili Gaming versus TYLOO game</a> in the lower bracket. As for FPX, this ends their VCT 2025 year, as this confirms that they cannot qualify for Champions via points or Stage 2.</p>

</span>, after showing promise internationally, their only positives so far in 2025 were their group stages in both Stage 1 and Stage 2, but playoffs are a whole different beast now in VCT China.</p>

<p>Starting on Lotus, EDG stuck to their guns and ran the double Duelist with <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/3017/nobody">
		nobody	</a>
</span> on Yoru, while Trace ran double Controller. EDG won the first pistol, needing to start strong on the attack side with their composition. They hit a roadblock after failing to convert the bonus, as Trace built a 5-3 lead after some convincing round wins. However, EDG were able to regain some form as they won the final four rounds of the first half and ended up 7-5. Not the best half for their composition, but a lead nonetheless.</p>

<p>Trace started the second half by winning the pistol, converting the bonus, and staying perfect to win every round on their attack half to end the map 13-7. Both <span data-ref-id="10">

</span>. </p>

<p>Sunset had to be the start of the comeback for EDG, and they started strong with their solo Neon double Initiator composition, winning pistol and converting the bonus round. Once again, the determination from Trace showed by erasing an early deficit and taking a lead of their own, but they were able to hold that lead to 7-5 at the half. However, Trace was running a double Sentinel composition with Deadlock and Cypher, meaning their attack half would likely be more of a challenge. </p>

<p>That came to fruition, as EDG won a pistol, lost their antieco, and still managed to quickly tie the game at 8-8. Even with only one Sentinel in their composition, <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/15559/chichoo">
		CHICHOO	</a>
</span> was having a great time for EDG, stopping the pushes from Trace. Even as EDG went down 10-8, they won every round afterward to win Sunset 13-10 and bring the series to map three.</p>

<p>Ascent was the final map for one of these two teams, and the teams decided to run significantly different compositions. Trace stuck to double Sentinel with Yoru as their catalyst, while EDG ran double Initiator with <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/51244/jieni7">
		Jieni7	</a>
</span> on KAY/O. After winning the pistol, Trace held stout on their defense even after another small run from EDG. <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/37494/kai">
		Kai	</a>
</span> was dominant on Yoru, with 18 kills on the defense side alone, putting EDG down 8-4 at the half.</p>

<p>EDG needed a strong second half, and that started with a pistol win to swing momentum in their favor. Even after failing to convert the bonus, it was still clear that EDG were in the zone, with one player in particular saving multiple rounds for them. That was nobody, who went from an underwhelming Yoru against DRG and on map one to his comfort pick on Sova, which paid dividends on this Ascent defense. </p>


<p><em>nobody and Smoggy team up to kill all five Trace players on defense. (Clip via Project Horizon)</em></p>

<p>Even as the game was tied at 11-11, <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4742/smoggy">
		Smoggy	</a>
</span> stepped up to nearly ace the final round as EDward Gaming won the map 13-11 and the series 2-1.</p>

<p>The series MVP was CHICHOO, who was consistent across the maps and particularly outstanding on Sunset. He ended the series with a 1.19 match rating, 222 ACS, 53 kills, +13, and 135 ADR.</p>

<p>With this win, EDG stays alive and will face the loser of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/527579/xi-lai-gaming-vs-dragon-ranger-gaming-vct-2025-china-stage-2-ubsf" target="_blank">the Xi Lai Gaming versus Dragon Ranger Gaming matchup</a>. As for Trace, their Stage 2 and Champions hopes end here.</p>
