He appeared earlier on a conservative radio show, saying that if elected it would take him only “two seconds” to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/us/politics/trump-jack-smith.html" title="">fire the special counsel Jack Smith</a>, who twice indicted the former president.</p><p>But behind the scenes, a prominent think tank is laying the groundwork for a much greater purging of government officials who are not loyal to Trump. The group, America First Policy Institute, didn’t even exist four years ago, but it has installed itself as the Trump campaign’s primary partner in making plans for a potential second term.</p><p>A.F.P.I., as the group is known, has received far less scrutiny than Project 2025, a similar right-wing plan made by the Heritage Foundation. But it is poised to be more influential. The group’s vision includes more barriers to abortions; more petroleum production; work requirements for Medicaid recipients; and the elimination of nearly all civil service protections. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign-america-first-policy-institute.html" title="">Read more about the group and its plans</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A natural gas field in Bolivia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aizar Raldes/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-4708e0d7">The U.N. said the world has made no progress on climate</h2><p>One year after world leaders made a landmark promise to move away from fossil fuels, countries have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/climate/un-climate-change-global-emissions-report.html" title="">essentially made no progress in cutting emissions</a> and tackling global warming, according to a U.N. report released today.</p><p>The report said that nations have been so slow to curtail their use of oil, gas and coal that it now looks unlikely that countries will be able to hold global warming to the limit they agreed to under the Paris climate agreement in 2015.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>International students in Brampton, a city near Toronto.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ian Willms for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-4fdb1719">Canada tightened immigration after years of expansion</h2><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced today that Canada would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/world/canada/canada-immigration.html" title="">significantly cut the number of newcomers it allows in</a>.
