This past weekend, social media posts and little-known websites spread lurid claims of previous actions by two of the candidates, without providing evidence or citing sources — suggestions of personal wrongdoing serious enough to sink their campaigns. Neither the I.O.C. nor the candidates have commented publicly, but the allegations became grist for gossip at the I.O.C. gathering.</p><p>A few days earlier, an anonymous author emailed a complaint, reviewed by The New York Times, to the I.O.C.’s chief ethics official, outlining a different set of allegations — a string of potential campaign rule breaches — without naming particular candidates. The complaint was detailed enough to rattle the campaigns and the committee’s staff.</p><p>An I.O.C. spokesman said on Wednesday that the questions raised in the email had been looked into, and were fairly routine matters. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Some officials, along with candidates’ aides, have dismissed the online and email allegations as disinformation campaigns of the kind the Olympics <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/world/europe/ioc-fake-news.html" title="">have faced in recent years</a>. But the sensational claims and targeting of individuals have created deep unease around the election of a new leader.</p><p>The winner will immediately be thrust into managing the sports movement’s relationship with a convulsing world, in which old certainties and alliances are no longer guaranteed. One of the first ports of call for the new president will be the Trump White House, ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Juan Antonio Samaranch of Spain is widely seen as a top contender to lead the I.O.C.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fabrice Coffrini/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The new leader will need to manage the relationship with the Russian Olympic Committee, banned from the Paris Games last summer over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and earlier banned from several Olympics <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/sports/russia-doping-sochi-olympics-2014.html" title="">for systematic doping</a>. There are also the challenges of a volatile and politically sensitive discussion about transgender athletes, and of maintaining the relevance of the Olympic movement<span>  </span>in a fast-changing world.</p><p>But the role also confers great status — the winner will be recognized globally and courted by world leaders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Given those stakes, the last hours until the vote have been a frenzy of quiet politicking, with almost the entire Olympic movement at a Greek luxury beach resort, ahead of a vote that is likely to go through several rounds before a majority of the I.O.C. coalesces behind any of the seven candidates.</p><p>“I don’t know if we will win or lose votes, but I can promise you that I will be working until the very last second, until 3:59:59 tomorrow afternoon,” said Juan Antonio Samaranch, a Spaniard who is widely seen as a top contender. His father led the I.O.C. for two decades, through 2001, and shaped much of what it has become.</p><p>Another leading candidate, Sebastian Coe of Britain, was all smiles as he circulated among I.O.C. members on Wednesday. “I’m in good shape but it’s only lunchtime,” he told reporters.</p><p>Amid the fervor to get the upper hand, a campaign that had been genteel has become much harsher and more personal.</p><p>Many of the attacks have been anonymous or private, but not all. The Sunday Times of London this week published <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/sport/olympics/article/juan-antonio-samaranch-jr-ioc-president-fascist-son-d9wgg3zp9" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a profile of Mr. Samaranch</a> with a headline calling him “Fascist’s son and friend of China.” His father supported the long-ago Franco dictatorship, and two Chinese I.O.C. members are on the board of a foundation named for the elder Mr. Samaranch.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The campaign of one of his rivals, Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe, has been dogged by claims that the outgoing leader, Thomas Bach, has been secretly canvassing on her behalf — a breach of etiquette, if not of the rules. Ms. Coventry, a gold medal-winning former swimmer, is the only woman in the field.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kirsty Coventry, a former Olympic swimmer, is the only woman in the field of contenders.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fabrice Coffrini/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Bach refused to answer directly a question about his involvement, at a news conference on Monday. After 12 years at the helm, he is ineligible to run again.</p><p>Perhaps the best-known contender is Mr. Coe, a gold medal-winning former track star, former member of Parliament and lead organizer of London’s successful 2012 Olympics. He has also been the most vocally critical of Russia.</p><p>Mr. Coe has drawn scrutiny for seeking advice from Andy Coulson, a political operative and former editor who was jailed in connection with a major <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/05/world/europe/andy-coulson-to-be-sentenced-in-phone-hacking-case.html" title="">phone-hacking scandal</a> that led to the closure of Britain’s biggest-selling newspaper. “We’ve been delighted to help Seb with his manifesto,” Mr. Coulson said in a message.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Other candidates include Prince Faisal bin Al Hussein, a brother of Jordan’s king; and Johan Eliasch, chairman of the sporting goods company Head and president of the International Ski and Snowboard.</p><p>It is unclear what would happen should election violations be uncovered with the election so close. Ban-Ki Moon, the former U.N. Secretary-General, who heads the I.O.C. ’s ethics commission, told The New York Times in a brief conversation that his group was looking into “maybe two” complaints before shrugging and saying, “but the election is tomorrow.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tariq Panja is a global sports correspondent, focusing on stories where money, geopolitics and crime intersect with the sports world.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tariq-panja">More about Tariq Panja</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>South Korea’s Martial Law: </strong>President Yoon Suk Yeol came close to disabling Parliament with a few hundred troops.
