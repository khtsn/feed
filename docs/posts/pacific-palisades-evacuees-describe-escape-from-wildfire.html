The scenic Sunset Boulevard became an escape route. Cars clogged the road on Tuesday, all headed away from Pacific Palisades except for the emergency vehicles that wailed their way toward the blaze.</p><p>In one hilly neighborhood just southeast of the fire, a wall of smoke loomed high overhead. Olga Arango, 66, had been at work cleaning a home there — the owners were out of town — when she decided that it was time to go.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“I saw on the phone that we had to evacuate,” Ms. Arango said in Spanish, as she packed her car and considered her best route home to Van Nuys, Calif. “I didn’t finish, but I can come back tomorrow.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/07/multimedia/07california-fires-scene3-zkfp/07california-fires-scene3-zkfp-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/07/multimedia/07california-fires-scene3-zkfp/07california-fires-scene3-zkfp-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/07/multimedia/07california-fires-scene3-zkfp/07california-fires-scene3-zkfp-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A person looking over a fence as smoke rises from a nearby fire.

But then a nearby elementary school caught fire, sending flames dancing onto the roadway and forcing her to turn her car around. Afraid to go home, Ms. Grant tried her luck on a local fire road. But it too had become a dead end, blocked by locks and chains.</p><p>So Ms. Grant found shelter with nearby homeowners who seemed distant enough from the flames, at least for the moment. “You can see the fire and smoke right there — oh, wow, there’s a helicopter,” she said, speaking by phone from the home that was not hers. “It’s scary.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-5"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Firefighters working to put out the wildfire.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Cheung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A house in Pacific Palisades, Calif., on fire.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Cheung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Shawn Hubler<!-- --> and <!-- -->Orlando Mayorquín<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jacey Fortin covers a wide range of subjects for the National desk of The Times, including extreme weather, court cases and state politics all across the country.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jacey-fortin">More about Jacey Fortin</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
