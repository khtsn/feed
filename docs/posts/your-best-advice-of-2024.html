Differentiate between glass balls and rubber balls — and don’t be afraid to drop the rubber balls.” Everyone with whom I shared this little gem seemed to find it useful (or maybe they were humoring me?). I’m not sure why this particular advice stuck with me — really, it’s just saying “learn to prioritize,” a colorful riff on “don’t sweat the small stuff.” For whatever reason, picturing the messy, ungovernable realm of worries and to-dos as rubber and glass balls helped me think more clearly in times of stress.</p><p>Social media is an aphorism machine. Any bit of marginally useful wisdom has been reproduced in a paintbrush font and shared a million times on Instagram or TikTok. I’m reflexively repelled by the commodification of wisdom, but I’ll admit that I’ve been unexpectedly moved more than once by some random influencer who shows up in my feed, their voice urgent and commanding as they gaze right into my eyes and tell me something improbably pithy about boundaries or time or the necessity of letting the soft animal of my body love what it loves (a gorgeous <a href="http://www.phys.unm.edu/~tw/fas/yits/archive/oliver_wildgeese.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mary Oliver</a> line, no matter how many times it’s repeated).</p><p>The best advice for how to live well, though, comes from other people, from their actual process of trying and failing and trying again. I asked you a few weeks ago for your best advice of 2024 and, as in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/30/briefing/words-of-wisdom.html" title="">previous</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/31/briefing/your-best-advice-of-2022.html" title="">years</a>, your responses were so wise, so insightful and moving that I’m sorry I can’t share them all. I hope there’s some bit of insight in here that will provide you with clarity as you wind down this year and look ahead to the new one. I know there is for me.</p><h2 id="link-3cd3c739">The best advice you received</h2><ul><li><p>Do something today your tomorrow self will thank you for. — Ava Shaffer, Cincinnati</p></li><li><p>The real game doesn’t start until the fourth quarter.

It is the kindest thing you can do for an acquaintance. — John Immerwahr, Bryn Mawr, Pa.</p></li><li><p>Stop thinking about your problems and make someone else happy. — Sonja Jewell, Leesburg, Va.</p></li><li><p>Don’t just put things back.

(This is apparently the first special recorded by a woman at Radio City Music Hall.) Buteau’s special isn’t as brainy, brash or uncouth as others released this year, but there’s a sweetly molten core to her routines, a sense of genuine warmth. “You understand how love works?” Buteau asks toward the end of the hour.
