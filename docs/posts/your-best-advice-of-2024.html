    <h1>Your Best Advice of 2024</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The piece of wisdom I repeated the most this year came from a reader of The Morning who answered my call for advice last December: “We are all juggling so many balls. Differentiate between glass balls and rubber balls — and don’t be afraid to drop the rubber balls.” Everyone with whom I shared this little gem seemed to find it useful (or maybe they were humoring me?). I’m not sure why this particular advice stuck with me — really, it’s just saying “learn to prioritize,” a colorful riff on “don’t sweat the small stuff.” For whatever reason, picturing the messy, ungovernable realm of worries and to-dos as rubber and glass balls helped me think more clearly in times of stress.</p><p>Social media is an aphorism machine. Any bit of marginally useful wisdom has been reproduced in a paintbrush font and shared a million times on Instagram or TikTok. I’m reflexively repelled by the commodification of wisdom, but I’ll admit that I’ve been unexpectedly moved more than once by some random influencer who shows up in my feed, their voice urgent and commanding as they gaze right into my eyes and tell me something improbably pithy about boundaries or time or the necessity of letting the soft animal of my body love what it loves (a gorgeous <a href="http://www.phys.unm.edu/~tw/fas/yits/archive/oliver_wildgeese.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mary Oliver</a> line, no matter how many times it’s repeated).</p><p>The best advice for how to live well, though, comes from other people, from their actual process of trying and failing and trying again. I asked you a few weeks ago for your best advice of 2024 and, as in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/30/briefing/words-of-wisdom.html" title="">previous</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/31/briefing/your-best-advice-of-2022.html" title="">years</a>, your responses were so wise, so insightful and moving that I’m sorry I can’t share them all. I hope there’s some bit of insight in here that will provide you with clarity as you wind down this year and look ahead to the new one. I know there is for me.</p><h2 id="link-3cd3c739">The best advice you received</h2><ul><li><p>Do something today your tomorrow self will thank you for. — Ava Shaffer, Cincinnati</p></li><li><p>The real game doesn’t start until the fourth quarter.

(This is apparently the first special recorded by a woman at Radio City Music Hall.) Buteau’s special isn’t as brainy, brash or uncouth as others released this year, but there’s a sweetly molten core to her routines, a sense of genuine warmth. “You understand how love works?” Buteau asks toward the end of the hour. Buteau does.</p><h3 id="link-63067b6e"><span><strong>RECIPE OF THE WEEK</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Sullivan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-56a9b38d">Buttermilk-Brown Sugar Waffles</h2><p>Today’s the approximate halfway point in this week of holiday hullabaloo, and therefore a good opportunity for a moment of self-care. For me, that means waffles. Julia Moskin’s <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/9062-buttermilk-brown-sugar-waffles" title="">buttermilk-brown sugar waffles</a> are light, crisp at the edges, and very easy to throw together. They’re forgiving, too. If you don’t have buttermilk, you can use yogurt, or regular milk with a dash of lemon juice or vinegar for acidity. Cook up a batch this weekend, then freeze any leftovers, which are easy to reheat in the toaster. You’ll be very grateful to find them in January.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Rose Bowl.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David McNew/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><strong>Ohio State vs. Oregon, the Rose Bowl:</strong> This bowl game was once a gem of the college football postseason. Now it’s a quarterfinal game in the 12-team College Football Playoff. But some traditions live on: It’s still on New Year’s Day; it’s still preceded by a flowery parade; and it’s still got the most majestic setting in football, a century-old stadium at the foot of California’s San Gabriel Mountains. And, by dint of fate (or good scheduling), this year’s game even features two classic Rose Bowl teams — Ohio State and Oregon, both of which are serious title contenders. <em>Wednesday, 5 p.m. Eastern on ESPN</em></p><h3 id="link-c590adc"><span><strong>NOW TIME TO PLAY</strong></span></h3></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Melissa Kirsch is the deputy editor of Culture and Lifestyle at The Times and writes The Morning newsletter on Saturdays.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/melissa-kirsch">More about Melissa Kirsch</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
