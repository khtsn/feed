Voters do not view him as understanding the problems in their daily lives and have soured on his leadership as he approaches his 100th day in office.</p><p><em>[</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/upshot/trump-poll-numbers.html" title=""><em>Nate Cohn looks at President Trump’s polling numbers</em></a><em> from four different perspectives.]</em></p><p>Mr. Trump’s approval rating sits at 42 percent. His standing is historically low for a president this early in a term, but it is in line with his stubborn unpopularity, which did not prevent him from sweeping the battleground states in last year’s election.</p><p>Now, however, voters express dimming confidence about Mr. Trump’s handling of some of the top issues that propelled him back to the White House, including the economy and immigration, even as most Americans support deportations. Only 43 percent said they approved of how he has managed the economy this term, a serious erosion on an issue long seen as a strength.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The president’s pursuit of widespread tariffs — which has caused stock-market drops and gyrations — was opposed by 55 percent of voters, including 63 percent of independents.</p><p>Taken together, the survey’s findings show that any second-term honeymoon for Mr. Trump is over. His approval rating among crucial independent voters is now at a woeful 29 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-3"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Voters said he had “gone too far” on issue after issue — his tariffs, his immigration enforcement, his cuts to the federal work force. Broad numbers of independent voters sided with Democrats in believing that he had overreached.</p><p>Overall, a 54 percent majority said that Mr. Trump was “exceeding the powers available to him,” including 16 percent of Republicans and 62 percent of independent voters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Douglas Williams, 56, a cattle rancher and banker in rural Missouri who voted for Mr. Trump in each of the last three elections, still supports much of his agenda. But he worries that the president is “pushing the envelope” with some of his executive orders.</p><p>“Now, do I agree with the goal? Do I agree with the result? Probably,” Mr. Williams said. “But I am constitutionalist enough to at least be a little bit concerned about how far we push that.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>For some of Mr. Trump’s supporters, the chaos and his refusal to follow norms are part of his appeal, if not the point.</p><p>Among those who approve of Mr. Trump, nearly half still saw the recent months as chaotic. About 40 percent of Republican voters said that presidents should be able to do what they think is best — even if that might go outside existing rules. And 8 percent of voters who approved of Mr. Trump said his actions were “a unique threat to our system of government.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Sometimes you have to break the rules,” said Michael Craig, 63, a retired Republican from outside Germantown Hills, Ill.</p><p>Still, voters overall are questioning not just Mr. Trump’s methods, but also his policy agenda.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-11"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="approval-issue-embed" data-id="100000010129680" data-source-id="100000010129680"><div slug="approval-issue-embed" data-sourceid="100000010129680" id="embed-id-100000010129680">

That is a reversal from last fall, when many voters across demographic groups said his policies during his first term had helped them.</p><p>Trust in Mr. Trump on the economy was a key ingredient in his 2024 victory. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/14/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html" title="">Times/Siena poll</a> one year ago showed that 64 percent of voters fondly remembered how he had handled the economy as president. Yet now only 43 percent of voters gave him positive marks on the issue for the start of this term.</p><p>Voters remain deeply unhappy with the economy, even if they are divided over whom to blame.</p><p>Despite Mr. Trump’s short tenure, equal numbers of voters believe he is responsible for the economic conditions they face as those who see former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as accountable. A similar share said neither man was responsible.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>At the same time, far more voters believe that Mr. Trump has made the economy worse since taking office (50 percent) than better (21 percent).</p><p>Negative feelings about the economy spanned every race, level of education and region of the country, with less than 1 percent rating the economy as excellent, and 76 percent saying it was fair or poor.</p><p>Still, despite the upheaval in the markets, those views are largely unchanged since October.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s supporters mostly seem happy to give him more time to see how his economic agenda, especially on tariffs, plays out.</p><p>“I’ve actually thought, well, I’m 59, I don’t need a whole lot of stuff and I’m not going to buy a whole lot of stuff — so for me, I would just sit back and let it ride for a while,” said Tracey Carson, a retiree and independent voter in Wisconsin. “The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-canada-tariffs-metal.html" title="">aluminum thing with Canada</a> scared me a little because I’m a big Diet Coke drinker. But I think he’s using it as a tactic to make things fair and try to make a deal. Because he’s always all about the deal.”</p><p>One of Mr. Trump’s signature policies, mass deportation, continues to hold majority public support. And though he received negative marks for the deportation and imprisonment of Mr. Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, views of his handling of immigration policy remain relatively similar to what they were a year ago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>The policy of deporting people living in the United States illegally back to their home countries garnered 54 percent support, including from 18 percent of Democrats.</p><p>Still, voters overall viewed Mr. Trump’s handling of immigration negatively, with 47 percent approving and 51 percent disapproving.</p><p>The poll showed that Democrats begin the long march toward next year’s midterm elections with a glimmer of hope. Among all voters, 47 percent said they would rather vote for a Democrat for the House, compared with 44 percent for a Republican candidate.</p><p>Voters are clearly unhappy with the role played by Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and a senior White House adviser. With <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/us/politics/musk-cuts.html" title="">mixed success</a>, he has overseen drastic cuts to federal agencies through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/us/politics/trump-musk-doge-power.html" title="">battled with cabinet secretaries</a> over the scope of his authority.</p><p>Just 35 percent of voters viewed Mr. Musk favorably. And perhaps even more revealingly, attaching his name to his actions made them even less popular. The Times asked two questions about cuts by DOGE, and the spending reductions were more popular when Mr. Musk’s name was not included.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Adam Schechter, 46, a tech specialist in Springfield, Va., who voted for Mr. Trump last year, said he supported much of the president’s agenda but was concerned about the “very messy” way that he was going about it.</p><p>“A chain saw, as you might say,” Mr. Schechter said, two months after Mr. Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-cpac-chainsaw.html" title="">wielded a literal chain saw</a> to promote his cuts. “The way it’s all haphazardly handled has been not something I generally approve of.”</p><p>He was uneasy, too, about the “consolidation of federal power in the executive branch.”</p><p>“I didn’t like it under Biden,” he said. “I don’t really like it under Trump.”</p><p>Christine Zhang<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p><hr/><h3 id="link-5ae85221"><span>How This Poll Was Conducted</span></h3><p>Here are the key things to know about this poll from The New York Times and Siena College:</p><ul><li><p>Interviewers spoke with 913 voters nationwide from April 21 to 24, 2025.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Times/Siena polls are conducted by telephone, using live interviewers, in both English and Spanish. Overall, 97 percent of respondents were contacted on a cellphone for this poll. You can see the exact questions that were asked and the order in which they were asked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/25/us/elections/times-siena-poll-crosstabs.html" title="">here</a>.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Voters are selected for the survey from a list of registered voters. The list contains information on the demographic characteristics of every registered voter, allowing us to make sure we reach the right number of voters of each party, race and region. For this poll, interviewers placed more than 120,000 calls to more than 35,000 voters.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>To further ensure that the results reflect the entire voting population, not just those willing to take a poll, we give more weight to respondents from demographic groups that are underrepresented among survey respondents, like people without a college degree. You can see more information about the characteristics of respondents and the weighted sample at the bottom of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/25/us/elections/times-siena-poll-crosstabs.html" title="">the results and methodology page</a>, under “Composition of the Sample.”</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The margin of sampling error among registered voters is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. In theory, this means that the results should reflect the views of the overall population most of the time, though many other challenges create additional sources of error. When the difference between two values is computed — such as a candidate’s lead in a race — the margin of error is twice as large.</p></li></ul><p>You can see full results and a detailed methodology <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/25/us/elections/times-siena-poll-crosstabs.html" title="">here</a>.

deep doubts about some of the signature pieces of his agenda, a New York Times/Siena College poll found. <a
