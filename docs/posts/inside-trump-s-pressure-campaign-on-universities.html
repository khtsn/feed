    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/14/us/trump-news-tariffs" title=""><em>Follow live updates on the Trump administration.</em></a></p><p>As he finished lunch in the private dining room outside the Oval Office on April 1, President Trump floated an astounding proposal: What if the government simply canceled every dollar of the nearly $9 billion promised to Harvard University?</p><p>The administration’s campaign to expunge “woke” ideology from college campuses had already forced Columbia University to strike a deal. Now, the White House was eyeing the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university.</p><p>“What if we never pay them?” Mr. Trump casually asked, according to a person familiar with the conversation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private discussion. “Wouldn’t that be cool?”</p><p>The moment underscored the aggressive, ad hoc approach continuing to shape one of the new administration’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-university-college.html" title="">most consequential policies</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump and his top aides are exerting control of huge sums of federal research money to shift the ideological tilt of the higher education system, which they see as hostile to conservatives and intent on perpetuating liberalism.</p><p>Their effort was energized by the campus protests against Israel’s response to the October 2023 terrorist attack by Hamas, demonstrations during which Jewish students were sometimes harassed. Soon after taking office, Mr. Trump opened the Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, which is scrutinizing leading universities for potential civil rights violations and serving as an entry point to pressure schools to reassess their policies.</p><p>It is backed by the influence of Stephen Miller, who is Mr. Trump’s deputy chief of staff for policy and the architect of much of the president’s domestic agenda.</p><p>The opaque process is upending campuses nationwide, leaving elite institutions, long accustomed to operating with relative freedom from Washington, reeling from a blunt-force political attack that is at the leading edge of a bigger cultural battle.</p><p>The task force includes about 20 administration officials, most of whom the government has not publicly identified, citing potential security risks. They meet each week inside a rotating list of federal agency headquarters in Washington to discuss reports of discrimination on college campuses, review grants to universities and write up discoveries and recommendations for Mr. Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On a parallel track, a few powerful aides in the West Wing, including Mr. Miller, have separately moved to stymie funding for major institutions without formally going through the task force.</p><p>These aides have spoken privately of toppling a high-profile university to signal their seriousness, said two people familiar with the conversations. And they have already partially suspended research funding for more than twice as many schools as has the task force, according to those familiar with their work.</p><p>This account of the inner workings of the higher education pressure campaign is based on interviews with more than two dozen senior administration officials, university leaders and outside advisers for both sides. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations or because they feared retribution against their campuses.</p><p>The White House scored an early win with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/nyregion/columbia-response-trump-demands.html" title="">Columbia’s capitulation</a> last month to a list of demands that included tightening disciplinary policies and installing new oversight of the university’s Middle Eastern, South Asian and African studies department.</p><p>Since then, the Trump administration expanded its focus to six more of the nation’s most exclusive universities, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/politics/trump-harvard-funding-demands.html" title="">including Harvard</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>By the time Mr. Trump privately discussed stopping all payments to Harvard, the task force had opened a funding review. That led the administration to send the university a list of demands on Friday, including that it bring in an outsider “to audit those programs and departments that most fuel antisemitic harassment or reflect ideological capture.” The government also insisted that Harvard change hiring and admissions in departments that “lack viewpoint diversity” and “immediately shutter” any programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion.</p><p>Harvard said on Monday that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/harvard-trump-reject-demands.html?campaign_id=60&amp;emc=edit_na_20250414&amp;instance_id=152561&amp;nl=breaking-news&amp;regi_id=271771972&amp;segment_id=195992&amp;user_id=f21f60077c4dbe2a090cc19f562fe1df" title="">it would not acquiesce</a>. The university’s president, Alan M. Garber, wrote in <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/president/news/2025/the-promise-of-american-higher-education/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an open letter</a> that most of the administration’s demands “represent direct governmental regulation of the ‘intellectual conditions’ at Harvard.” The university, Dr. Garber added, “will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”</p><p>In a separate letter, two outside lawyers representing Harvard told administration officials that the university “is not prepared to agree to demands that go beyond the lawful authority of this or any administration.”</p><p>But the scope of the administration’s campaign is still poised to widen. The Education Department has warned <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-educations-office-civil-rights-sends-letters-60-universities-under-investigation-antisemitic-discrimination-and-harassment" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">60 universities</a> that they could face repercussions from pending investigations into accusations of antisemitism.</p><p>The push comes as public confidence in higher education has plummeted in the past decade, according to a Gallup <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/646880/confidence-higher-education-closely-divided.aspx?version=print" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poll</a> in July. The decline was driven mostly by concerns of colleges pushing political agendas, not teaching relevant skills, and the costs, the survey showed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Still, university leaders have been stunned by the swift assault, with no clear sense of how the Trump administration chooses its targets, on what basis it is formulating penalties, or how to push back. Many see the effort as a widespread attack on academic freedom aimed at crushing the influence of higher education.</p><p>“I’ve never seen this degree of government intrusion, encroachment into academic decision-making — nothing like this,” said Lee C. Bollinger, who spent 21 years as Columbia’s president and more than five years leading the University of Michigan.</p><p>For their part, Trump administration officials and their allies say they are trying to hold accountable a system that each year receives about <a href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/surveys/higher-education-research-development/2023#data" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$60 billion</a> in federal research funds while educating about <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cha/undergrad-enrollment" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">15 million</a> undergraduates.</p><p>“We’re not looking to just file lawsuits — we want to compel a cultural change in how Jewish Americans are treated on college campuses,” Attorney General Pam Bondi, a member of the task force, said in an interview.</p><p>But the effort has gone beyond addressing antisemitism, with schools targeted for diversity programs and supporting transgender athletes. In the view of some of Mr. Trump’s closest advisers and key donors, leftists have seized control of America’s most powerful institutions, including pillars of higher education, and wresting back power is key to the future of Western civilization.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“The universities seem all powerful and they have acted as if they were all powerful, and we’re finally revealing that we can hit that where it hurts,” Christopher F. Rufo, a conservative activist who has championed the strategy, said in an interview.</p><h2 id="link-1d7eb723">‘Vanquish the Radicals’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/10/multimedia/dc-trump-education30-cmhk/dc-trump-education30-cmhk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/10/multimedia/dc-trump-education30-cmhk/dc-trump-education30-cmhk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/10/multimedia/dc-trump-education30-cmhk/dc-trump-education30-cmhk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="The shadow of a man is projected onstage against an American flag as supporters hold up their phones and signs supporting him." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/10/multimedia/dc-trump-education30-cmhk/dc-trump-education30-cmhk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/10/multimedia/dc-trump-education30-cmhk/dc-trump-education30-cmhk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/10/multimedia/dc-trump-education30-cmhk/dc-trump-education30-cmhk-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/10/multimedia/dc-trump-education30-cmhk/dc-trump-education30-cmhk-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/3ea185ed-b188-5a2e-a456-3a8c5de447e0" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>During a rally last May in Waukesha, Wis., President Trump asked college presidents to “vanquish the radicals and take back our campuses for all of the normal students.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>During last year’s presidential campaign, Mr. Trump looked out from his rally stages and described a nation he viewed as rampant with discrimination against conservatives.</p><p>And for him, nowhere was political injustice as pervasive as on college campuses run by “Marxist maniacs and lunatics.”</p><p>Weeks after opening his third presidential bid, Mr. Trump had announced a “free speech policy initiative,” <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/president-donald-j-trump-free-speech-policy-initiative" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">promising</a> to strip federal research dollars and student loan support from universities involved in what he generalized as “censorship activities or election interferences.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Six months later, he complained about “racial discrimination” in higher education, suggesting universities were increasingly hostile to white students. He vowed to open civil rights investigations into schools that promoted diversity, and he doubled down on those threats when the Supreme Court rejected affirmative action in college admissions.</p><p>At the same time, Mr. Miller, the longtime Trump adviser, was working on similar issues at America First Legal, the nonprofit he started during the Biden administration. The group has sued New York University and Northwestern University, accusing them of discriminating against white men. </p><p>Mr. Trump turned more forcefully to combating antisemitism as a political rallying cry after Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas militants led an attack that killed more than 1,200 people in Israel in what was the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. War in Gaza followed, and so did months of protests, particularly among pro-Palestinian students on college campuses.
