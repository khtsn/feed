The only question is whether on Sunday she will secure the majority of votes needed to avoid a runoff.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Maia Sandu, the pro-Western incumbent, is facing 10 other candidates.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dumitru Doru/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The referendum, however, is more uncertain, mainly because at least a third of all people on electoral rolls must cast ballots for the result to be valid.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That could be a challenge given that, according to Nicolae Panfil, a program director at Promo-LEX, a group that monitors elections, hundreds of thousands of people listed as voters are no longer in the country: They have either moved abroad for work or died.</p><p>The <a href="https://pv.cec.md/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">central electoral commission</a> said on Sunday that updated electoral rolls included 2,714,239 people, and that more than 30 percent of voters had cast ballots by early afternoon.</p><p>Moldovans outside the country, who are generally younger and more pro-European, will be able to vote at embassies and polling stations in the countries where they live.</p><p>Mr. Panfil said the constitutional referendum should meet the voter threshold given the high turnout in four previous referendums, all but one of which passed. But, he added, clearing that bar will require Moldovans living abroad to cast ballots in large numbers, which they have done in the past.</p><p>A yes vote in the referendum, Mr. Panfil said, would have important, long-term consequences. “It is not just an opinion poll,” he said, but a binding mandate for constitutional change to moor the country in the West.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>An <a href="https://watchdog.md/en/polls/208333/sondaj-socio-politic-octombrie-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opinion poll released on Friday by Watchdog,</a> a research group, found that 55 percent of those surveyed would vote yes to enshrining E.U. membership as Moldova’s “strategic objective” and the “irreversibility” of the country’s “European course.”</p><p>More than a third, however, said they opposed this, and about the same proportion favored joining the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/31/world/europe/european-union-or-eurasian-economic-union.html" title="">Eurasian Economic Union,</a> a Moscow-led bloc comprising Russia, Belarus and three other former Soviet republics.</p><p>The survey results suggested that while a majority of Moldovans favor integration with the West, a significant pool of voters in a country sandwiched between Ukraine and Romania, a member of NATO and the European Union, still look to Russia. These include residents of largely Russian-speaking areas in the north near Ukraine and older Romanian-speakers who remember Soviet rule as a time of economic and political stability.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Moldova, sandwiched between Ukraine and Romania, has been tugged between East and West for decades.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/world/europe/natalia-morari-moldova-corrupt-business.html" title="">Natalia Morari, an estranged former ally of Ms. Sandu who is running against her for the presidency</a>, dismissed the referendum as a “political ploy” to gin up support for Ms. Sandu in the presidential race. She said it would do nothing to advance Moldova’s European aspirations and would have to be repeated once negotiations with Brussels are completed. “This referendum is not about real European integration and is just political technology,” she said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The referendum is still being closely watched by Moscow, Brussels and Washington, all of which have sought to sway the outcome.</p><p>The United States and the European Union have offered economic support, including a package worth about $2 billion announced during a recent visit to Moldova by Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission.</p><p>Russia has deployed less transparent methods in its own efforts to influence voting, focused on mobilizing hostility toward Ms. Sandu and the West among the substantial minority of the population that sees Moscow as a more reliable partner.</p><p>These have included furtive cash transfers to pay anti-E.U. activists by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/24/world/europe/moldova-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">Ilan Shor, a fugitive convicted fraudster from Moldova sheltering in Moscow</a>. Officials have also described an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/europe/moldova-russia-european-union-election.html" title="">enormous campaign of disinformation</a> aimed at stoking fear of war if the referendum passes and spreading false claims that Brussels wants to brainwash Moldovan children into becoming gay or transgender.</p><p>Mr. Shor, <a href="https://x.com/ilanshormoldova/status/1847360608716673514" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a message from Moscow on X,</a> the only major social media platform from which he has not been ejected, called on all those “who care about Moldova and the future of your children” to vote for any candidate other than Ms. Sandu and to “say NO to criminal amendments of our constitution, NO to the EU and NO to war.” The vote, he warned, “is our last chance!”</p><p>“Russia is working actively to undermine Moldova’s election and its European integration,” the U.S. National Security Council spokesman, John F. Kirby, said on Wednesday. He added that “in the last several months, Moscow has dedicated millions of dollars to influencing Moldova’s presidential election.” A spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, says Moscow “categorically rejects” accusations of Russian meddling in Moldova.</p><p>@Ruxanda Spatari contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew Higgins is the East and Central Europe bureau chief for The Times based in Warsaw.
