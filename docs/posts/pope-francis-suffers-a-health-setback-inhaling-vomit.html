The Vatican said Francis was cooperating “with therapeutic maneuvers,” and was in “good spirits.”</p><p>The pope was admitted to the hospital with bronchitis and later, pneumonia was diagnosed. He had a respiratory crisis last Saturday that he appeared to have overcome, and medical bulletins in recent days were cautiously upbeat, though doctors had said he was not out of danger. In recent days doctors had said that Francis was no longer in “critical condition,” but that his situation was “complex.”</p><p>“It’s a setback,” Austen Ivereigh, Pope Francis’ biographer, <a href="https://x.com/austeni/status/1895545714329207095" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>, adding “I was getting too confident. Please keep up prayers.”</p><p>Others shared his concern.</p><p>“Given his age, and given that he is in such a state, we must be worried,” Father Felicien Abengalo, a priest in Rome, said on Friday. “His illness is not a minor illness.”</p><p>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Elisabetta Povoledo is a reporter based in Rome, covering Italy, the Vatican and the culture of the region.
