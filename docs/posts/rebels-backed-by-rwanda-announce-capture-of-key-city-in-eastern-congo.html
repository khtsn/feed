Now it has come roaring back, aiming to occupy the region for the long term and exploit its valuable rare minerals, according to United Nations experts.</p><p>This time, M23 appears to be in a stronger position to keep hold of Goma, a city made up mainly of people who left their homes in terror and will now have to live under the rule of one of the armed groups they fled.</p><p>A spokesman for M23 <a href="https://x.com/LawrenceKanyuka/status/1883677840446832956/photo/2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> the “liberation of the city of Goma” in a post on X, saying Congolese military personnel had to hand over their arms to the U.N. and assemble in a stadium before 3 a.m. There was no confirmation that had been completed yet, though, and there were scattered reports of gunfire in the city into Monday morning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The conflict in eastern Congo — an area about the size of Michigan — was once labeled Africa’s World War.
