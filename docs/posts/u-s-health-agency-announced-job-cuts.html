Kennedy Jr. Together with previous buyouts and resignations, the agency — which provides oversight of medical care, food and drugs — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/us/politics/health-department-job-layoffs-rfk-jr.html" title="">will have seen its staff shrink by nearly a quarter</a> in the early months of the administration.</p><p>The major reduction will cut especially deep at two agencies within the department that have been in Kennedy’s sights: the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Both are expected to lose roughly 20 percent of their staff members from the latest cuts.</p><p>The restructuring is intended to bring communications and other functions directly under Kennedy. Stunned employees struggled to absorb the news, and some expressed concern that the cuts could threaten public health and safety.</p><p>The move continued President Trump’s effort to downsize the federal bureaucracy sharply. Another cutback that my colleagues reported today: A crackdown on FEMA, which has been targeted by Elon Musk, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/us/politics/musk-fema-immigrations-doge-freeze-aid.html" title="">effectively froze billions of dollars in disaster grants</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mark Carney, Canada’s prime minister.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Chan/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-443af997">Canada’s leader vowed to retaliate against U.S. auto tariffs</h2><p>When Trump announced yesterday that he would soon impose a 25 percent tariff on imported cars, he cast it as a way to bring factory jobs back to the U.S. Canada’s prime minister today described the levies as a threat to Canadian workers and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/27/business/trump-tariffs" title="">promised retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods</a>.</p><p>“We will respond forcefully,” Prime Minister Mark Carney said. “It is clear that the United States is no longer a reliable partner.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A protest in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, yesterday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-38849a20">Protesters in Gaza demanded an end to Hamas rule</h2><p>On each of the last three days, hundreds of people have marched down streets in Gaza to protest the war and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/world/middleeast/gaza-hamas-protests.html" title="">demand an end of Hamas’s 18-year-old rule</a>.</p><p>The rare displays of dissent against the armed group were catalyzed in part by an Israeli airstrike this week in Beit Lahia.
