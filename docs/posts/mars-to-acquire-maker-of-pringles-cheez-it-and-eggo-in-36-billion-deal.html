It values Kellanova at $35.9 billion, including debt, a hefty premium to the company’s market value before news of the deal first began to leak.</p><p>Kellanova owns a large menu of brands including Cheez-It, Pringles and Eggo.</p><p>Mars, which is privately owned, has tried to broaden beyond sweets. In 2020, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/business/dealbook/kind-bars-acquired-mars-snickers.html" title="">bought</a> Kind North America, the company that makes Kind Bars. Mars, best known for its chocolate candies, has also invested heavily in its sizable pet business, which includes the pet food brand Iams, as well as animal clinics and hospitals.</p><p>A deal for Kellanova would allow Mars to offer an array of both salty and sweet food. It would echo a strategy undertaken by Hershey, with its acquisition of the parent company of SkinnyPop and Dot’s Pretzels.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“In welcoming Kellanova’s portfolio of growing global brands, we have a substantial opportunity for Mars to further develop a sustainable snacking business that is fit for the future,” Poul Weihrauch, the chief executive of Mars, said in a statement.</p><p>Kellanova was once owned by the cereal giant Kellogg’s, which separated its snack business from its cereal brands last year. It renamed the cereal business WK Kellogg and its snack food business Kellanova.</p><p>Kellanova, which says it operates in 180 markets, generated more than $13 billion in revenue last year. It employs roughly 23,000 people. Mars, with more than 150,000 employees, recorded more than $50 billion in sales last year. </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lauren Hirsch joined The Times from CNBC in 2020, covering deals and the biggest stories on Wall Street.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lauren-hirsch">More about Lauren Hirsch</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>From Online Hate to Real-World Violence: </strong>Social media posts assailing immigrants have fomented a climate of fear and hatred in Britain, Portugal and other countries. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/09/technology/migrants-racism-social-media-violence.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">The vitriol is now spilling onto the streets</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bari Weiss Knows What She’s Doing: </strong>The founder of The Free Press has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/business/media/bari-weiss-free-press.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">built a new media empire</a> by persuading audiences that she is a teller of dangerous truths.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reviving Downtown San Francisco: </strong>The city, which is among those most devastated in the United States after the pandemic, is trying to lure businesses back with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/business/san-francisco-storefronts-free-rent.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">free rent for up to six months</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>How to Not Get Scammed: </strong>Online schemes get more sophisticated all the time. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/business/online-scams-advice.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">Here’s how to protect yourself and what to do if you get duped</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Skirting A.I.
