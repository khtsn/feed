The all-cash deal values Kellanova at $35.9 billion, including debt, a hefty premium to the company’s market value before news of the deal first began to leak.</p><p>Kellanova owns a large menu of brands including Cheez-It, Pringles and Eggo.</p><p>Mars, which is privately owned and best known for its chocolate candies, has tried to broaden beyond sweets. In 2020, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/business/dealbook/kind-bars-acquired-mars-snickers.html" title="">bought</a> Kind North America, the company that makes Kind Bars. Mars has also invested heavily in its sizable pet business, which includes the pet food brand Iams, as well as animal clinics and hospitals.</p><p>Acquiring Kellanova would allow Mars to offer an array of both salty and sweet food. It would echo a strategy that Hershey employed, with its acquisition of the parent company of SkinnyPop and Dot’s Pretzels.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“In welcoming Kellanova’s portfolio of growing global brands, we have a substantial opportunity for Mars to further develop a sustainable snacking business that is fit for the future,” Poul Weihrauch, the chief executive of Mars, said in a statement.</p><p>The deal comes at a tenuous time for food and beverage manufacturers. For more than two years, Big Food has steadily increased prices on products, partly to cover higher commodity and labor costs but also to expand their profit margins. Now, some consumers are pushing back, either buying less or trading down to generic brands. The result for many food companies has been slower revenue growth and fewer items sold.</p><p>Executives at Kellanova noted this month that consumers who earned $100,000 or less in income and had children were proving to be especially price sensitive when shopping at the grocery store. Kellanova has increased its promotions in hopes of luring the shoppers back.</p><p>“Consumers are getting more used to these prices,” Steve Cahillane, the chief executive of Kellanova, said to analysts and investors on an earnings call. “It doesn’t mean they’re not still under pressure and that we have to, you know, make sure to some of the earlier conversations, we’re hitting the right price points, the right pack sizes, you know, the right promotions at the right time of the month.”</p><p>Those promotions are, so far, supporting volume growth in key markets. In the quarter ending late June, the company reported a 4 percent increase in organic net sales — excluding currency and the divestiture of its business in Russia — with volumes growing 2 percent in North America, which makes up roughly half of its business.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Kellanova was created by the food giant Kellogg’s, which spun off its North American cereal business, now known as WK Kellogg Co., from its snack business, rebranded as Kellanova, last year.</p><p>Kellanova, which says it operates in 180 markets, generated more than $13 billion in revenue last year. It employs roughly 23,000 people. Mars, with more than 150,000 employees, recorded about $50 billion in sales last year.</p><p>The deal is expected to close in the first half of next year, the companies said. The acquisition could attract the attention of regulators, who have taken a tough approach to corporate consolidation under the Biden administration. Analysts from Jefferies said in a report on Wednesday that they found an overlap in only 18 country-product combinations, out of hundreds of possibilities, “likely limiting any roadblocks to the deal,” they said.</p><p>Deal-makers have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/business/dealbook/saying-the-quiet-part-out-loud.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;sgrp=c-cb" title="">scrambling</a> to better understand what antitrust policy might look like after November’s presidential election, under either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald J. Trump.</p><p>Shares of Kellanova rose, but hovered a bit short of the $83.50 price per share offered by Mars, implying some uncertainty about the deal getting done.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lauren Hirsch joined The Times from CNBC in 2020, covering deals and the biggest stories on Wall Street.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lauren-hirsch">More about Lauren Hirsch</a></span></p></div><div><p>Julie Creswell is a business reporter covering the food industry for The Times, writing about all aspects of food, including farming, food inflation, supply-chain disruptions and climate change.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/julie-creswell">More about Julie Creswell</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>From Online Hate to Real-World Violence: </strong>Social media posts assailing immigrants have fomented a climate of fear and hatred in Britain, Portugal and other countries. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/09/technology/migrants-racism-social-media-violence.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">The vitriol is now spilling onto the streets</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bari Weiss Knows What She’s Doing: </strong>The founder of The Free Press has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/business/media/bari-weiss-free-press.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">built a new media empire</a> by persuading audiences that she is a teller of dangerous truths.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reviving Downtown San Francisco: </strong>The city, which is among those most devastated in the United States after the pandemic, is trying to lure businesses back with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/business/san-francisco-storefronts-free-rent.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">free rent for up to six months</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>How to Not Get Scammed: </strong>Online schemes get more sophisticated all the time. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/business/online-scams-advice.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">Here’s how to protect yourself and what to do if you get duped</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Skirting A.I.
