The budget bill faces stiff resistance — <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/05/14/congress/the-titanic-johnson-predicts-houses-big-beautiful-reconciliation-bill-will-sink-in-the-senate-00348310" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including from some Senate Republicans</a> — and it’s putting America’s strained finances in focus.</p><p><strong>The latest: </strong>Yields on the 30-year Treasury bond are steady on Thursday. But they climbed to nearly 5 percent on Wednesday, a level last reached in early April when “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-tariff-pause-be-cool.html" title="">yippy</a>” investors revolted against Trump’s reciprocal tariffs. A reminder: That helped force the White House to reverse course on those levies.</p><p>Stocks have rebounded since. But long-dated bonds have not, even as Trump continues to tour the Middle East, hailing a windfall of deals that he says will bolster American businesses and the economy.

It’s the latest bad news for UnitedHealth; its shares took a hit after the company unexpectedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/business/unitedhealth-ceo-andrew-witty.html" title="">replaced its C.E.O.</a> and suspended its 2025 financial guidance.</p><p><strong>Microsoft reportedly nears a deal with the E.U. to avoid a big antitrust fine.</strong> European Union regulators are likely to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/eu-antitrust-regulators-accept-microsofts-office-teams-offer-sources-say-2025-05-14/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accept the tech giant’s proposal</a> to settle a competition case involving its Office and Teams products, according to Reuters. If a deal is reached, it would spare Microsoft <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/25/tech/microsoft-teams-eu-antitrust" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">potentially billions of euros’ worth of penalties</a>, after having already accumulated €2.2 billion in fines in recent years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>Harvard arranges $250 million for research after a federal funding freeze.</strong> The university said it had <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-14/harvard-to-fund-250-million-for-research-amid-government-fight" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">freed up the money</a> to help cope with the Trump administration withholding more than $2.6 billion in funds — though it warned that school officials and researchers would have to make “prudent decisions” about program adjustments. Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, will take a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/us/harvard-garber-trump-pay.html" title="">25 percent pay cut</a>.</p><h2 id="link-17a93955">Trump’s latest deals in the Middle East</h2><p>President Trump is in the midst of his Middle East trip, one meant to drum up investment from allies in the region. The visit has continued to deliver, especially for U.S. businesses like Boeing.</p><p>But it’s a potential deal of a different sort that is moving markets on Thursday.</p><p><strong>The latest:</strong> Boeing struck an agreement to sell up to 210 to Qatar Airways, in what the manufacturer called its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boeing-and-qatar-airways-announce-historic-order-for-up-to-210-widebody-airplanes-302455748.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">largest wide-body jets order</a>.

(GE Aerospace’s chief, Larry Culp, specifically praised “President Trump’s support for this historic agreement.”)</p><p>Separately, Saudi Aramco, the Saudi state-controlled oil giant, said that it had signed agreements potentially <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/saudi-aramco-signs-deals-worth-up-90-billion-with-us-companies-2025-05-14/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">worth up to $90 billion</a> with U.S. companies. That said, it didn’t provide many details, and several of the accords were merely memos of understanding.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>Markets also moved on potential progress for a different sort of deal.</strong> The price of Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, was down nearly 4 percent on Thursday after Trump suggested that there was movement <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/15/us/trump-news/f14024bf-94ac-53d2-a4ed-27e0f30a1e9b" title="">in talks with Iran</a> over its nuclear weapons.</p><p>“We’re in very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace,” Trump said on Thursday, adding that he wanted Iran to be a great nation but not to have nuclear weapons. The expectation is that a deal would lead to a lifting of sanctions on Tehran and potentially bring more oil into the international market.</p><ul><li><p>In related news: Trump said that India offered to essentially <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/trump-says-india-offered-to-remove-all-tariffs-on-us-goods" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lift all tariffs on American goods</a> — but added that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/trump-wants-apple-to-stop-moving-iphone-production-to-india" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he disapproved</a> of Apple’s plan to make U.S.-bound iPhones there.</p></li></ul><hr/><p>dealbook series: how tariffs are affecting U.S. business</p><h2 id="link-6031640d">‘It’s a nightmare for a small brand like ours’ </h2><p><a href="mailto:dealbook@nytimes.com" title="">We’ve been asking</a> DealBook readers how tariffs have affected their companies. Today, we’re featuring Laurie Sebestyen, who, along with her husband, Mike Buechi, owns <a href="https://currylove.com/pages/about-us-1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mike’s Organic Curry Love</a>.</p><p>The company, based in Boise, Idaho, started in 2008 and sells Thai-inspired meal kits, sourcing all its ingredients from Thailand. It generates just under $2 million in annual sales. The two are the only employees.</p><p>The responses have been lightly edited and condensed.</p><p><strong>How much do you have to pay in tariffs now?</strong></p><p>Right now, we’re at 17 percent — the new 10 percent base on top of an existing 7 percent that has been in place since the expiration of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/01/business/global/01trade.html" title="">GSP</a>, which kept tariffs low for exports from countries like Thailand. One container that came in this week was $12,000 in customs duties for about $70,000 worth of goods. Before the new tariffs, we were paying more like $5,000 for the same value of goods.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But that’s not the only cost. We pay roughly $7,000 just for transport. That’s before taxes and insurance.</p><p><strong>How much has that added to your costs?</strong></p><p>Our margins are slim to begin with. Our gross margins hover around 40 percent, but for net margin we’re barely breaking even. In addition to our cost of goods, we have to pay slotting fees, which is what a retailer charges for placing you on the shelf. And then promotions, like the first box is free.</p><p>Also storage, fulfillment, Amazon fees, advertising, coupons, shipping — everything has gone up in recent years.</p><p>After all the costs, we can barely afford to live on what we make.</p><p><strong>How much of the added costs have you had to pass on to customers?</strong></p><p>So far, none. When the new tariffs were announced, a couple of our retailers and distributors sent us letters telling us they won’t be accepting any price increases.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Maybe larger brands that have larger margins can negotiate. But for a small business, where you’re living day to day, it’s an impossible situation.</p><p><strong>What do you think about Trump’s plan to use tariffs to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.?</strong></p><p>I want to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. as much as possible. But things like coffee and chocolate and coconut don’t grow here. When we started out, we produced our curries in California, but we had issues with consistency. We realized Thai curries are best made in Thailand.</p><p>It doesn’t make sense to do trade this way. It’s a nightmare for a small brand like ours.</p><p><strong>Previous reader responses:</strong><em> </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/business/dealbook/corporate-gloom-trump-tariffs.html#link-3133192e" title="">Deer Stags</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/business/dealbook/nvidia-chips-china-trade-war.html#link-4c168a19" title="">Frameology</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/business/dealbook/pope-francis-business-poor.html#link-3c029ae4" title="">Seim &amp; Partner</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/business/dealbook/trump-tariff-pricing-strategy.html#link-465b8093" title="">Aremco Products</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/business/dealbook/countdown-to-china-trade-talks.html#link-32ccc8ec" title="">National Roofing</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/business/dealbook/bessent-trade-talks-china.html#link-7d66a065" title="">Le Petit Triangle Cafe</a></p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A.G.

Suddenly, the newspapers he read looked like they were printed with too little ink.</p></blockquote><p>Buffett’s physical slowdown, he said, stood in stark contrast to his 62-year-old handpicked successor, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/business/dealbook/gregory-abel-warren-buffett-berkshire.html" title="">Gregory Abel</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“The difference in energy level and just how much he could accomplish in a 10-hour day compared to what I could accomplish in a 10-hour day — the difference became more and more dramatic,” Buffett said. “He just was so much more effective at getting things done, making changes in management where they were needed, helping people that needed help someplace, but just all kinds of ways.</p><p>“It was unfair, really, not to put Greg in the job,” he added. “The more years that Berkshire gets out of Greg, the better.”</p></blockquote><hr/><p><strong><em>Has your company changed its D.E.I. policies?</em></strong> <em>The New York Times is </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/us/dei-policies-changes.html" title=""><em>looking to talk to people</em></a><em> whose work life has been affected by changes to diversity, equity and inclusion policies.</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h3 id="link-7c091e00"><span>THE SPEED READ </span></h3><p><strong>Deals</strong></p><ul><li><p>Starbucks is said to be sounding out private equity firms and other companies as it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/starbucks-is-said-to-kick-off-process-to-sell-stake-in-sprawling-china-business?srnd=phx-deals&amp;sref=0w5HLLb3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">weighs options for its China operations</a>, including a possible stake sale.
