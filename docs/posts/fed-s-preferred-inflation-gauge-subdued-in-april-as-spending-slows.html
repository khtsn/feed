But the outlook for the economy has become even more muddied amid constant changes to President Trump’s policies.</p><p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, released on Friday, climbed 2.1 percent in April from a year earlier, slightly lower than the previous reading of 2.3 percent and closer in line with the Fed’s 2 percent target. On a monthly basis, prices increased 0.1 percent after staying flat in March.</p><p>The “core” personal consumption expenditures price index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs and is closely watched as a measure for underlying inflation, rose 0.1 percent in April. Compared with the same time last year, it is up 2.5 percent. In March, it rose at an annual pace of 2.6 percent.</p><p>Personal spending rose 0.2 percent for the month, a significant drop compared to March’s 0.7 percent increase.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The data from the Commerce Department covered a period in which Mr. Trump unveiled and then quickly rolled back aggressive tariffs against virtually all of the country’s major trading partners after U.S. government bond markets <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/business/bond-market-tariffs-trump.html" title="">seized up</a>. He has since minted tentative deals with some countries, like the United Kingdom, but also threatened fresh levies on imports from the European Union. He delayed those days later.</p><p>In the latest twist, a federal appeals court on Thursday agreed to temporarily preserve many of Mr. Trump’s tariffs after a lower court deemed them illegal earlier this week.</p><p>The back-and-forth has left businesses and consumers in a state of limbo, complicating assessments of how significantly prices may rise and the economy will slow over time. Costco, the retail giant, announced this week that it was pulling forward purchases in an attempt to avoid tariffs and would only raise prices as a “last resort.” Walmart recently warned it is unlikely to avoid doing so. Most economists had expected price pressures to start showing up more meaningfully in the data over the summer and for growth to moderate after that point. But as the scope and scale of the tariffs continue to change, so too do those forecasts.</p><p>How significantly Republicans end up cutting taxes and slashing spending will also affect the outlook, as will the administration’s efforts to deport immigrants.</p><p>Friday’s data reinforced the Fed’s decision to be patient about forthcoming interest rate cuts. Officials argue that they can afford to take their time before making any policy moves because the economy is in solid shape so far. Consumers have started to come under <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/15/business/economy/us-economy-recession-consumer-spending.html" title="">a bit more strain</a>, but with layoffs low, the central bank is confident that the labor market is not yet on the verge of cracking.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The concern is that this could change suddenly if businesses, under pressure from rising prices and slower demand, start to cut costs and begin shedding workers. Until that happens, however, the Fed is likely to stay on hold. That approach will keep it in the cross hairs of the president, who wants the central bank to lower borrowing costs now.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/us/politics/trump-powell-meeting-fed-economy.html" title="">private meeting</a> on Thursday, Mr. Trump told Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, that he was making a mistake by not reducing borrowing costs. While Mr. Powell did not discuss his outlook for monetary policy, he told the president that such decisions would “depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook.”</p><p>Traders in federal funds futures markets wager that the Fed lowers interest rates at least once this year, far less than was expected several months ago. Because the central bank is charged with both keeping inflation low and stable and with keeping the labor market on firm footing, a rise in prices will make its policy decisions all the more difficult. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/business/fed-interest-rates-inflation-tariffs.html" title="">Minutes from the Fed’s last meeting</a> in May showed that the central bank’s staff is predicting slower growth than it had at the last gathering in March, as well as higher unemployment. At the time, it also expected tariffs to “boost inflation markedly this year and to provide a smaller boost in 2026.” That combination has the makings of a stagflationary shock, which risks the Fed having to make painful trade-offs over which of its goals to prioritize.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Colby Smith covers the Federal Reserve and the U.S. economy for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
