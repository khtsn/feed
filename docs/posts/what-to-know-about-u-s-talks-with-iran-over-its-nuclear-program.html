started on Saturday between American and Iranian officials over Tehran’s nuclear program.</p><p>It would probably be enough to keep the discussions going, and potentially lead to the first official face-to-face negotiations between the two countries since President Trump abandoned a landmark nuclear accord seven years ago.</p><p>The talks, in the Gulf nation of Oman, are a feeling-out session to see whether the Trump administration and Iran’s clerical leaders could move to full negotiations to limit Iran’s nuclear activities.</p><p>The Iranian state news media reported that the talks had begun midafternoon in Muscat, the Omani capital, which American and Iranian diplomats have used as neutral negotiating territory for years. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, and Steve Witkoff, the American official leading Mr. Trump’s team, both arrived hours earlier.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The two sides are coming in with deep distrust, given that Mr. Trump walked away from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html" title="">2015 accord</a> that Iran had brokered with the United States and other world powers, and then imposed harsh sanctions on Tehran during his first term.</p><p>Mr. Trump now wants to strike a deal — both to showcase his negotiating skills and to keep simmering tensions between Iran and Israel from escalating into a more intense conflict that would further roil the Middle East.</p><p>“I want Iran to be a wonderful, great, happy country, but they can’t have a nuclear weapon,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCZGKHfzE2w" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he told reporters on Friday night</a> aboard Air Force One.</p><p>Iranian officials are skeptical but are open to “a chance for an initial understanding that would mark a path for the negotiations,” Mr. Araghchi <a href="https://x.com/IrnaEnglish/status/1910971684984664308" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Saturday before the talks began.</a></p><p>The goals of Saturday’s meeting are modest, reflecting the gap between the two sides: to agree on a framework for negotiations and a timeline. It is not clear whether the envoys will speak directly, as Mr. Trump has insisted, or pass messages through Omani intermediaries shuttling between rooms, as described by Mr. Araghchi’s spokesman as the talks began.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Oman’s foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi, met separately with Mr. Araghchi and Mr. Witkoff to outline the format for the talks. The Iranian delegation had planned to convey that it is open to talking about scaling back uranium enrichment and allowing outside monitoring of its nuclear activity, according to two senior Iranian officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. They said the negotiators were not interested in discussing dismantlement of the nuclear program, which Trump administration officials have insisted on.</p><p>Experts predicted that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/29/iran-foreign-minister-obama-handshake" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a handshake</a> or another brief encounter would be a way to satisfy both sides and send a gesture of good will without direct negotiations.</p><p>Mr. Trump said this past week that he would rely on instinct as to whether Saturday’s talks could blossom into further negotiations and that they would end “when I think they’re not going along well.”</p><h2 id="link-4260b111">What’s at stake?</h2><p>At issue is the dwindling power of the original nuclear deal — which European leaders have kept limping along since 2018, when Mr. Trump withdrew the United States. The deal’s <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/2025-will-be-a-decisive-year-for-irans-nuclear-program/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">most punishing restrictions expire in October</a>.</p><p>Known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and completed under President Barack Obama, the accord was the result of years of painstaking and technical negotiations that agreed to lift international sanctions against Iran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Only nine countries are known to have nuclear weapons, and adding Iran to the list could pose an existential threat to its main adversary, Israel, and other nations. <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2004-12/iran-nuclear-briefs/iran-case-addressing-why-countries-want-nuclear-weapons" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Experts also have raised concerns</a> that Iran could share its nuclear capabilities with terrorist groups.</p><p>Iran has long maintained that its nuclear activities are legal and meant only for civilian purposes, like energy and medicine. But it has highly enriched uranium, <a href="https://onu.delegfrance.org/iran-joint-statement-by-france-germany-united-kingdom-on-non-proliferation" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">beyond the levels necessary for civilian use</a>, which can be used to make a nuclear warhead.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Iranian officials are skeptical but “ready to engage in earnest and with a view to seal a deal,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, center, wrote in The Washington Post this week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In the years since Mr. Trump withdrew from the nuclear accord, Iran has steadily accelerated uranium enrichment to the point where some experts estimate that it could soon build a nuclear weapon. Its economy has crumbled under American sanctions, and Mr. Trump this week <a href="https://www.state.gov/sanctions-on-irans-oil-network-to-further-impose-maximum-pressure-on-iran-2/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imposed new measures</a> targeting Iran’s oil trade.</p><p>Israel’s government worries that Iran will expand its nuclear program and is pushing to destroy it.</p><p>“The deal with Iran is acceptable only if the nuclear sites are destroyed under U.S. supervision,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel <a href="https://x.com/VividProwess/status/1909638032577167381" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> this week. “Otherwise, the military option is the only choice.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>While Mr. Araghchi was closely involved in the earlier negotiations, Mr. Witkoff has little experience in the technical aspects of Iran’s program. He arrived in Oman after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/world/europe/ukraine-trump-witkoff-talks.html" title="">visit Friday to</a> St. Petersburg for talks with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia about a potential cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine.</p><p>Iran will all but certainly extend diplomatic talks for as long as possible — both to delay Israeli military action and to push past an Oct. 18 deadline when the United Nations’ authority to impose quick “snapback” sanctions on Iran expires.</p><p>“They have an opportunity to tie Israel and the United States in knots by getting into negotiations in which they dupe Witkoff into thinking that negotiations will produce a lot,” said Elliott Abrams, who served as Mr. Trump’s Iran envoy during his first term. “And so the negotiations start, which holds Israel off, and they continue, and they continue.”</p><p>A new deal could be reached pretty quickly, he said, but Iran would most likely commit to little more than what it agreed to in the 2015 accord. Such an outcome would irritate Israel.</p><p>It also might not be enough for Mr. Trump, who previously demanded more limits both on Iran’s missile development and its proxy forces in Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen, so he can claim to have struck a better deal than his Democratic predecessors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>On Saturday, the Iranian state news media said that efforts to negotiate aspects of Iran’s defense and military capabilities, regional presence or other domestic issues would mean the negotiations “will end much quicker.”</p><h2 id="link-418e0d57">Diplomacy or conflict?</h2><p>Mr. Abrams predicted that Israel would eventually strike Iran anyway. Since at least last fall, Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/us/politics/us-intelligence-israel-iran.html" title="">has been preparing</a> highly precise long-range missiles, including ones that can hit underground targets, for an airstrike on Iran.</p><p>The Trump administration also has deployed an extraordinary military buildup in range, including two aircraft carriers, additional B-2 stealth bombers and fighter jets, as well as air defenses.</p><p>Yet Mr. Trump keenly wants to avoid a new war in the region, which his <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/j-d-vance-says-a-war-with-iran-is-not-in-the-u-s-interest/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">advisers have warned</a> would siphon military resources away from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/china-weapons-yemen-bombing.html" title="">other potential threats</a>, like China, and detract from his efforts to be a president of peace.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel at the White House on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Still, Mr. Trump has said he is prepared for the worst.</p><p>“If it requires military, we’re going to have military,” he said on Wednesday, adding that Israel would “obviously be the leader of that.”</p><p>Iran is also steeling itself.</p><p>“Mark my words: Iran prefers diplomacy, but it knows how to defend itself,” Mr. Araghchi said recently.<strong> “</strong>We seek peace, but will never accept submission.”</p><p>Farnaz Fassihi<!-- -->, <!-- -->Adam Rasgon<!-- --> and <!-- -->Leily Nikounazar<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lara Jakes, based in Rome, reports on diplomatic and military efforts by the West to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.
