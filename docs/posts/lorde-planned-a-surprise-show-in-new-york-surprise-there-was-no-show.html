Tonight 7 p.m.” She did not specify which park. She did not have to.</p><p>By 6 p.m., hundreds of young people had descended on Washington Square in Greenwich Village, creating a festive atmosphere, with Lorde songs blasting, some people smoking marijuana and several climbing trees for a better view of a concert that did not happen.</p><p>As the designated time approached, word began to spread that the Police Department had canceled the concert. Many of those in the crowd stayed put, hoping that what they were hearing was just a bad rumor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Siddhi Vora and Brady Arellano had come to the park together and were among those who waited. Ms. Vora, 26, said they would be upset if they were to leave and then Lorde turned up. Mr. Arellano, 27, took a seasonal perspective.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“If she didn’t come out, it would feel like summer isn’t starting yet,” one fan said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Hamja for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We were just saying that this feels like the start of the summer,” he said. “So if she didn’t come out, it would feel like summer isn’t starting yet.”</p><p>Summer, it seemed, would have to wait.</p><p>Just before 7 p.m., Lorde posted an Instagram story confirming that the planned show would not proceed.</p><p>“Omg @thepark the cops are shutting us down,” she wrote. “I am truly Amazed by how many of you showed up!!! But they’re telling me you gotta disperse … I’m so sorry.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>A spokeswoman for the Parks and Recreation Department confirmed that the city had blocked the show from proceeding because it lacked permits.</p><p>The department, “in collaboration with the N.Y.P.D. and the Mayor’s Office of Citywide Special Events, worked with the organizers to safely cancel the unpermitted event,” the spokeswoman, Meghan Lalor, said.</p><p>“A sound and a parks permit is required to have a concert in a New York City park,” a police spokesman said. “This individual did not possess either.”</p><p>Representatives for Lorde did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>In some ways, the spontaneous, unsanctioned event echoed one staged by the social media star Kai Cenat at Union Square Park in August 2023, with an important difference: In that instance, thousands of his fans erupted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/04/nyregion/union-square-kai-cenat-twitch-giveaway.html" title="">in a chaotic melee</a> after the police moved in to break it up.</p><p>Mr. Cenat was initially charged with inciting a riot. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/07/nyregion/kai-cenat-union-square-charges.html" title="">The charges were dropped</a> after he agreed to post a public apology and pay for the damages that his mostly young, male fans had caused.</p></div></div><div data-testid="CardDeckBlock-8"><div data-testid="cardDeck"><figure data-slug="22-MET-LORDE-GRID"><div><div></div><div></div></div><figcaption>Amir Hamja for The New York Times</figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In Lorde’s case, many of those she had summoned to the park continued to hang around even after she told them to disperse, either in hopes that she might yet emerge or because, on a nice spring night, they had no place better to be.</p><p>“I’m waiting it out,” said Alexa Hamilton, 26, who had come to the park from work in SoHo. “Might as well. I’m not rushing to anything right now, so I am kind of hanging out until the crowd clears a little and it’s easier to get out.”</p><p>As music continued to play, the anticipated performance by Lorde turned into a Lorde dance party. At around 8 p.m., when it became clear that, as peaceful as they were, many people were not going to disperse on their own, about a half-dozen police officers waded into the crowd. They were greeted with a chorus of boos.</p><p>Minutes later, the speaker playing the music was cut off in the middle of “Royals,” which earned Lorde, 28, Grammys for song of the year and best pop solo performance in 2013.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“God forbid a girl have fun,” someone in the crowd said.</p><p>Then suddenly, in defiance of the police, the music was pumping again, and officers began to move toward the speaker. At that point, someone grabbed it and, after being instructed by the police, began to walk out of the park with many people following behind.</p><p>The crowd was soon flooding the street outside the park, with people cheering and the music continuing to play.</p><p>Those who had remained in the park or had made their way back were rewarded. Sometime after 8:30 p.m., according to <a href="https://x.com/spanish_pop_/status/1914863597391429639" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video posted on social media</a>, Lorde arrived in the park, climbed onto a small platform and danced with abandon as a speaker played “What Was That.”</p><p>The crowd, phones aloft, cheered, whooped, danced and sang along.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Annie Aguiar is a reporter covering arts and culture and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.</p></div><div><p>Ed Shanahan is a rewrite reporter and editor covering breaking news and general assignments on the Metro desk.</p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/04/22/nyregion/lorde-washington-square-surprise-show.html">0</a></span></p></div></span></p><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/04/22/nyregion/lorde-washington-square-surprise-show.html">0</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Big Apple’s Wild Mushrooms:</strong> New Yorkers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/nyregion/mushrooms-new-york-city.html">can find thousands of species of fungus</a>, with names like American dyeball, dingy twiglet and devil’s dipstick.
