More than 1,000 homes and businesses were reduced to ash. The fires have killed least two people and forced more than 100,000 others to evacuate. Many of my colleagues are on the ground there, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/08/us/california-wildfire-la-palisades" title="">reporting live</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/08/weather/los-angeles-fire-maps-california.html" title="">Here is a map tracking the fires</a>, and photographs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/us/california-wildfire-photos.html" title="">capturing the scenes from around the city</a>.</p><p>Officials warned that the worst might still be yet to come. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/us/palisades-eaton-hurst-fire-california.html" title="">The two largest blazes were not at all contained</a>, and firefighters were facing unfathomable conditions, including ferocious winds and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/08/us/california-wildfire-la-palisades#a-lack-of-water-has-hindered-firefighting-efforts" title="">a dwindling water supply</a>. Firefighters from across the West were traveling in to help.</p><p>The largest fire decimated the affluent Pacific Palisades neighborhood. Businesses were charred, power lines were downed and the air was full of smoke. Several blocks of homes along Sunset Boulevard, the area’s famous thruway, were completely destroyed. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/us/california-fires-landmarks-pasadena-palisades-malibu.html" title="">Local landmarks burned down</a>.</p><p>One resident dropped to his knees in front of a firefighter who was battling a blaze consuming the home next door, begging him to turn the water on the flames threatening his own home. Another firefighter warned: “We’re down to 25 percent. Hold off.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At a shelter in Pasadena, a man told his wife that their home had been destroyed. The woman fell to her knees, sobbing. In Pacific Palisades, a man trekked through the debris to confirm that his house was gone. “I just needed to see it,” he said.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jack Smith, the special counsel.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-7666f697">D.O.J. said it would hold off on releasing part of Trump report</h2><p>Federal prosecutors said today that they planned to release a portion of a report by the special counsel, Jack Smith, detailing his investigation into Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn his loss in the 2020 election. They also said the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/us/politics/trump-documents-report-jack-smith.html" title="">planned to hold off on releasing the other volume of the report</a>, which details Smith’s investigation into Trump’s handling of classified documents.</p><p>The prosecutors explained in a filing that it was legally problematic to release the volume on the documents case while the prosecution of Trump’s co-defendants was still ongoing. The filing came in response to a surprising court injunction blocking both volumes of Smith’s report from being released.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge near Kaktovik, Alaska, in October.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lindsey Wasson/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-12e0e56b">No one bid for the chance to drill in Alaska’s wilderness</h2><p>Donald Trump said this week that oil drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was one of his top energy priorities. But the Interior Department announced today that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/climate/arctic-wildlife-refuge-drilling-leases.html" title="">an effort to auction oil and gas leases in the pristine wilderness</a> had ended without a single bidder.</p><p>Auctions to drill on the land have flopped twice in four years. The failures suggest that oil companies either are not interested or do not think it’s worth the cost. Some Alaska lawmakers and officials argued, however, that the Biden administration had not offered up enough land after it cut the allotment by more than two-thirds. Alaska’s governor called the auction “designed to fail.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-55bd377a">More top news</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Washington:</strong> In an interview, President Biden said that he could have won re-election if he had stayed in the race.

Helen Reichert, for example, lived to be 109, outlasting all the doctors who kept telling her to stop smoking cigarettes.
