Prosecutors said he engaged in “hands-on sex acts” with two of the victims.</p><p>Mr. Terranova, who retired in September 2023 while he was suspended from the department, “abused his position as a police officer to gain the trust of his victims in a despicable strategy to gratify his sexual desires,” said Breon Peace, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, in a statement.</p><p>Vinoo Varghese, Mr. Terranova’s lawyer, said he would appeal. The former officer faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison and could receive a life sentence, according to the news release.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We’re disappointed in the verdict as there was more than enough reasonable doubt to acquit on all charges,” Mr. Varghese said.</p><p>He added: “This federal prosecution was a waste of taxpayer dollars and should have been just prosecuted locally. Chris, however, is a sexy target because he was a cop.”</p><p>That position of authority is at the heart of the case.</p><p>Prosecutors said Mr. Terranova targeted the robbery victim after the boy came to the 121st precinct on Staten Island to report the crime. The officer got the boy’s cellphone number from a department database and messaged him, saying he hated seeing “these things happen to good guys like yourself,” according to the news release.</p><p>He continued conversing with the boy about the robbery investigation, asking if he had any interest in the police department or its youth programs, while telling him that he had also “been through a lot” and was there if he ever wanted to talk, the release said.</p><p>These conversations went on between March and May of 2023 until Mr. Terranova asked the boy to add him on Snapchat and Instagram, asked him sexually explicit questions, sent him a photo of his genitals and asked for a sexually explicit photograph, the release said. The boy told his mother about the messages, and she reported it to the police.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Another boy, in Texas, met Mr. Terranova on social media and trusted him in part because he said he was a police officer, prosecutors said.</p><p>The officer traveled to Texas at least 16 times to visit the boy and bought a home in the child’s neighborhood, prosecutors said.</p><p>“You being with me … and making love to me is more than a sign of everything happens for a reason,” he wrote to the boy in a message, according to the news release.</p><p>Another time, prosecutors said, Mr. Terranova took an acquaintance’s son to a secluded location on the way home from a birthday party and “directed” the boy to engage in sex acts with him.</p><p>The officer also met a 12-year-old victim while he was on duty, later messaged him on Snapchat and solicited sexually explicit photos, according to the news release.</p><p>He was convicted after a five-day trial.</p><p>The Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for a comment Friday night.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
