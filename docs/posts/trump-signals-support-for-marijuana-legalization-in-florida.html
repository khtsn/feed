Trump on Saturday signaled his support for a ballot measure that would legalize recreational marijuana in Florida, stopping short of a full endorsement but saying that he did not believe marijuana should be criminalized in his adopted home state when it is legal in others.</p><p>In a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113057012516008786" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on his social media platform</a>, Truth Social, Mr. Trump portrayed the passage of the ballot measure, known as Amendment 3, as inevitable and raised concerns about its implementation. Public opinion polls show that a majority of Florida voters favor the measure.</p><p>“Whether people like it or not, this will happen through the approval of the Voters, so it should be done correctly,” Mr. Trump said. “We need the State Legislature to responsibly create laws that prohibit the use of it in public spaces, so we do not smell marijuana everywhere we go, like we do in many of the Democrat run Cities.”</p><p>Mr. Trump, who votes near his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, had previously avoided taking a position on the question. His position pits him against Gov. Ron DeSantis and most of the state’s Republican leaders, who are working to defeat the proposal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s statement appeared to walk a line meant to keep him from fully upsetting those opposed to the measure. He did not say how he personally would vote on Amendment 3, and he did not explicitly back the legalization of marijuana even as he again suggested he supported decriminalizing it.</p><p>“Someone should not be a criminal in Florida, when this is legal in so many other States,” he said. “We do not need to ruin lives &amp; waste Taxpayer Dollars arresting adults with personal amounts of it on them, and no one should grieve a loved one because they died from fentanyl laced marijuana.”</p><p>Still, activists backing Amendment 3 praised Mr. Trump’s support for their effort. Smart and Safe Florida, the campaign working to pass the ballot measure, said in a statement that Mr. Trump agreed with its views that Florida must “put an end to the arrest and incarceration of adults for simple possession of marijuana.”</p><p>Florida <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/us/politics/florida-trump-biden-democrats.html" title="">has been trending Republican</a>, but polls show that Amendment 3 is more popular in the state than even Mr. Trump is — indicating that many voters intend to split their ticket and vote both for the former president and for marijuana legalization.</p><p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/03/26/most-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana-for-medical-recreational-use/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Polling suggests</a> that most Americans now say marijuana should be legal for medical or recreational use.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/us/politics/trump-florida-abortion-measure.html" title="">also weighed in on another Florida ballot measure</a>, known as Amendment 4, that would legalize abortions “before viability.” Polls show that a majority of Florida voters also support that measure, though it is unclear whether either Amendment 3 or Amendment 4 would receive the more than 60 percent support required to pass.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/us/trump-florida-abortion-rights.html" title="">Mr. Trump initially suggested</a> that he might support the abortion measure.</p><p>“I am going to be voting that we need more than six weeks,” Mr. Trump said when pressed in an interview about the measure, referring to the current Florida ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. His campaign quickly tried to say that his remarks were not indicative of how he would vote. The next day, Mr. Trump said that he would vote “No.”</p><p>Florida voters have often elected Republicans while also approving more liberal ballot measures — including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/us/politics/election-ballot.html" title="">legalizing medical marijuana</a>, which received 71 percent support in 2016. Mr. Trump won the state that year by just 1 percentage point.</p><p>This year, Mr. DeSantis and leading Florida Republicans have helped finance the campaigns against the abortion rights and recreational marijuana amendments. The billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, who is based in Miami, donated $12 million to the campaign against Amendment 3, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/article290675154.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calling the measure</a> “a terrible plan to create the nation’s most expansive and destructive marijuana laws.”</p><p>Mr. DeSantis has said that the measure would lead to the smell of marijuana filling the streets and would scare off families, businesses and tourists. “I don’t think we need to mess up the state,” he said in July.</p><p>But opposition to the measure has not been unanimous among Republicans. State Senator Joe Gruters, a Sarasota Republican who previously served as chairman of the Republican Party of Florida and is close with Mr. Trump, <a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/opinion/columns/guest/2024/08/01/im-a-tough-conservative-heres-why-florida-should-legalize-marijuana-free-state-desantis/74624653007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">broke with his party</a> this month to back Amendment 3, the marijuana measure. He called it “a common-sense decision that prioritizes individual freedom, health, safety and economic growth.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patricia Mazzei is the lead reporter for The Times in Miami, covering Florida and Puerto Rico.<span> </span></p></div><div><p>Michael Gold is a political correspondent for The Times covering the campaigns of Donald J.
