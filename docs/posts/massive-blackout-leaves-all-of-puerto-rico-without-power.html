It has taken as long as several days to restore service after similar blackouts in the past, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/us/puerto-rico-power-blackout.html" title="">an islandwide outage on New Year’s Eve</a>.</p><p>“We have experienced a massive blackout across the entire island due to all of the power generation plants unexpectedly going offline,” Genera PR, the company that generates power in Puerto Rico, <a href="https://x.com/Genera_PR/status/1912561495793357096" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a social media post on Wednesday</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Luma Energy, the company that distributes energy, <a href="https://x.com/lumaenergypr/status/1912554580400812243" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in its own post</a> that the blackout began around 12:40 p.m. on Wednesday. Many Puerto Ricans were preparing on Wednesday to be off work starting on Thursday as part of Holy Week; Gov. Jenniffer González-Colón was away on a personal trip.</p><p>Though Luma’s website showed that about a third of customers had power more than an hour later, Hugo Sorrentini, a Luma spokesman, said it was unlikely that any customer actually had any electricity, because all the power plants were offline.</p><p>In an interview with WKAQ-AM, a local radio station, shortly after the blackout began, Josué Colón, the island’s energy czar, said that it was too early to know what had set off the systemwide shutdown.</p><p>“We don’t know the cause,” he said, adding that restoring power would probably take at least a day.</p><p>Mr. Colón had warned in a radio interview last month that Puerto Ricans were likely to experience summer blackouts because the island did not have enough generating capacity available to meet peak summer demand.</p><p>That warning prompted three Democratic members of Congress — Ritchie Torres of New York, Darren Soto of Florida and Pablo José Hernández, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting resident commissioner — to send a letter to the Trump administration on Tuesday, raising the alarm “about the imminent grid reliability crisis confronting Puerto Rico’s electric system.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>According to the letter, the island is projected to experience power shortfalls on 90 days between June and October.</p><p>Puerto Rico has suffered extensive power grid problems since Hurricane Maria devastated the island in 2017.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patricia Mazzei is the lead reporter for The Times in Miami, covering Florida and Puerto Rico.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
