early 1980s, a group of popular, mean girls she calls “the Aprils” brought her — shy, bookish, not yet famous — into their intimidating fold. She was surprised they even knew her name.</p><p>“Part of me wanted to punch the girls’ smug faces,” she writes in her memoir “Say Everything,” due out from Gallery Books on March 4.

There’s her marriage to Adam Horovitz, better known as Ad-Rock from the Beastie Boys, which ended in divorce after Skye (“I was a serial cheater,” she writes) rediscovered her bisexuality and embarked on a series of affairs with women, including Jenny Shimizu, Ingrid Casares and Alice Temple. She’s now a mother of two and has been married to Ben Lee, a musician, since 2008. They live in Los Angeles but just spent the last year in Sydney.</p><p>In the epilogue of “Say Everything,” Skye says that by writing this memoir, she hopes to let some of her stories go.</p><p>When I asked about that sentiment, she said, “This book made me realize that I’m not great with loss or with grieving my past. I don’t want the past or my stories to control me in a heavy way. I want to be attached to my life now.”</p><p>As a Gen X-er who followed Skye’s career ever since I saw her in “River’s Edge” (1986) and then “Say Anything” (1989), I’ve always thought of her as a beautiful, intriguing enigma. Was she like Diane Court, the valedictorian “trapped in the body of a game-show hostess,” like her “Say Anything” character? Or was she rebellious and scrappy like Trudi in Allison Anders’s still-stellar 1992 indie “Gas Food Lodging”? She never felt like a performer who was striving for an Oscar. She seemed more like a cool girl who’d somehow appeared in the center of 1990s culture via Old Hollywood.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I don’t want the past or my stories to control me in a heavy way,” Skye said. “I want to be attached to my life now.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chantal Anderson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>When I asked Cameron Crowe, who directed “Say Anything,” about his impressions of Skye, he described her as quiet but a “raging emotional force.”</p><p>“She’s a real person that steps out of life to act sometimes,” he added. “She’s had an idiosyncratic, soulful career, and that’s reflected in the book.”</p><p>John Cusack, who hoisted a boombox over his head to woo her character in “Say Anything” — neither of them could have foreseen <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/love-80s-song-S2HWwvQyMnqkU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the meme</a> this would become — said he was instantly struck by her integrity. “One had the feeling she was an artist who had zero interest in being an ‘It Girl,’” he said, “which made her one, in a way.”</p><p>With her memoir, Skye finally gets the chance to tell all, and then some. Not many teenage girls get to hang out at Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall’s house (Skye was and is close with Jagger’s daughter Karis) or meet a tween River Phoenix when he popped by one Saturday. She writes about trysts with some of her co-stars, including Reeves, Cusack, Robert Downey Jr. and Matthew Perry, and reminisces about Christmas parties at Madonna’s house and vacations in Cabo with Gwyneth Paltrow, who briefly dated her brother Donovan. Of Paltrow, Skye writes, “If Gwyneth had been at Immaculate Heart, the Aprils would have been called the Gwyneths.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Skye, right, with her “River’s Edge” cast members, from left, Keanu Reeves, Crispin Glover, Roxana Zal, Josh Richman and Daniel Roebuck.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer/Getty Images, via Simon &amp; Schuster</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>As juicy as the book can be, it doesn’t come across as meanspirited or salacious.

Especially the ones in the 1990s.”</p><p>Toward the end of “Say Everything,” Skye writes, “I accepted years ago that I might not be made of the right stuff to be a full-on Hollywood power player.” She has been painting since she was a teenager and her work has been shown in Tokyo and Los Angeles, and in a joint show with Sofia Coppola and Kim Gordon. She also wrote a children’s book in 2014 called “My Yiddish Vacation,” illustrated by Scott Menchin. She’s just as happy working on one of her paintings or recording an episode of “<a href="https://www.weirdertogether.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Weirder Together</a>,” a podcast she co-hosts with Lee, as she is on a red carpet.

She holds her own amid a barrage of questions, but you get the sense that given half the chance, she’d have had a lot more to say. Back then, as she says in her book, she was often thrust into the “wide-eyed ingénue” role. Writing her memoir gave her the chance to do what she couldn’t back then: It allowed her to do all the talking.</p><p>“I’d been such an internal kid, I longed for people to know me,” she writes. “I felt ready to be seen. But the real me rarely was.”</p><p>When I asked Skye about that Stern interview, and those portrayals of her, she said: “When I was younger, I felt like women had to be quiet. It’s my instinct even now.”</p><p>Writing the book has helped her push back against that instinct. She recently finished filming a new twist on the “Anaconda” film franchise with Jack Black, Paul Rudd and Steve Zahn. Between shots one day, the three of them were telling jokes, and she found herself retreating.</p><p>“My instinct was to just let the men talk and be funny together, and I’ll just smile and listen,” she said. “And then I was like, what am I doing? I want to join in.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Dina Gachman is an Austin-based writer.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/dina-gachman">More about Dina Gachman</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>AR</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>9</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Enigma in the 1990s, Now Telling All<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/02/27/arts/ione-skye-memoir-say-everything.html">28</a></span></p></div></span></p><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/02/27/arts/ione-skye-memoir-say-everything.html">28</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore More in TV and Movies</h2><h3>Not sure what to watch next?
