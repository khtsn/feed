Is that a U.F.O.?’” said Ms. Dunbar, a 37-year-old acupuncturist and mother of three. “And we watched it the whole way home.”</p><p>Then, she said, she thought nothing more about it. Until earlier this week, when similarly bright, large and buzzing objects began flying low over her home in Bedminster, N.J.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>They were drones, she realized. And since then, she said, they have been back every night. Usually she and her husband, Nick Dunbar, see the first drone not long after sunset. Then they keep coming, one after another: sometimes five or more, following the same flight path.</p><p>“In the last week, it became a little bit of a menacing and, like, creepy thing,” Ms. Dunbar said.</p><p>Ms. Dunbar is not alone. Drone sightings have been reported in at least 10 New Jersey counties since mid-November. They have been spotted flying over important infrastructure, like reservoirs, power lines and railroads, in people’s backyards and above highways. They often fly in groups and emit a loud humming noise that Mr. Dunbar, 39, described as similar to the sounds made by electric cars. The drones appear to be significantly larger than <a href="https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1251&amp;context=jj_pubs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">those widely available to hobbyists</a>.</p><p>The sightings have prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to temporarily ban drones from flying over a <a href="https://tfr.faa.gov/save_pages/detail_4_8833.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">military base in Morris County</a> and a <a href="https://tfr.faa.gov/save_pages/detail_4_7952.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">golf club</a> owned and frequented by President-elect Donald J. Trump. On Nov. 26, drones flying near a landing zone prevented a medical helicopter from picking up a person injured in a car crash in Somerset County, <a href="https://www.nj.com/somerset/2024/12/mystery-drones-kept-helicopter-from-taking-patient-to-nj-hospital-college-says.html?outputType=amp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to NJ.com</a>.</p><p>State leaders and elected officials have said the drones do not pose any threat to the public. But they have yet to provide any information about who might be operating them, or why.</p><p>The reported sightings have alarmed local law enforcement officials. The police chief of Florham Park, N.J., said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/HHLZzxEhLgKmtNbj/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement on social media</a> that the drones’ presence appeared “nefarious in nature.” In Hunterdon County, <a href="https://www.goodmorninghunterdon.com/post/hunterdon-county-public-safety-director-and-sheriff-provide-update-on-recent-drone-sightings" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">officials said that drones had been seen</a> near the county’s emergency communications center and near Round Valley Reservoir, the largest in New Jersey and a <a href="https://www.njwsa.org/raritan-basin.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">critical part of the state’s water supply</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In recent days, drone sightings, which had been concentrated in northern New Jersey, have been <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/mysterious-drones-sightings-new-jersey/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported in the southern part of state</a>, in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0wsCZR7N8VpXNQDLBjK6rE48URcsaogyCuwdEeCThGP2vF863d6HYoyt51B3nb6D2l&amp;id=100064889221541" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Philadelphia suburbs</a> and in towns near the coast. In New York, some Staten Island residents have reported drones near the Howland Hook Marine Terminal and on the west shore. Vito Fossella, Staten Island’s borough president, asked the F.B.I. and the F.A.A. to investigate the sightings in a letter, describing the ongoing mystery as “odd and quite bizarre,” <a href="https://pix11.com/news/local-news/staten-island/mysterious-drones-reported-over-staten-island-in-nyc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to reports</a>.</p><p>The F.B.I.’s Newark field office has urged anyone with “relevant information” about the drones to call the bureau’s tip line or submit information online.</p><p>On Thursday, Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey said in a <a href="https://x.com/GovMurphy/status/1864717982275965389" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement on social media</a> that his office was “actively monitoring the situation” in coordination with federal and state law enforcement officers, and that there was “no known threat to the public at this time.”</p><p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday evening.</p><p>Unmanned objects in the sky have been spotted near U.S. military bases several times in the past year. In December 2023, drones swarmed the Langley Air Force Base in Virginia for 17 days, according to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/drones-military-pentagon-defense-331871f4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal report</a>, which added that similar sightings had been made this year near an Air Force base in California.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In the last few weeks, the U.S. Navy said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/europe/drones-us-air-bases-uk.html?timespastHighlight=drone" title="">“small unmanned aerial systems” had been seen</a> flying near or above four military bases used by the United States in Britain. Pentagon officials said they were taking the reports seriously, but that they did not present “any significant mission impact.”</p><p>For many New Jersey residents like the Dunbars, the drones feel more like an oddity, and a nuisance, than a threat. Still, the family is on edge, unnerved by the nightly mystery. They wonder when, or if, the flyovers will end.</p><p>“The thing that really feels unsettling is just like, is this always going to be like this?” Ms. Dunbar said, adding that she feared for her family’s privacy, not knowing what surveillance capabilities the drones might have.</p><p>“I’m not a conspiracist by any means,” she said, “but I don’t love the idea of massive drones patrolling where I live.”</p><p>Tracey Tully<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Shoplifter Whose Mother Was a Cop: </strong>Drug addiction fueled David Andino’s need to steal.
