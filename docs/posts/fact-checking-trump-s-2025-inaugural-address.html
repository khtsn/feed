He tempered the claim to the more unspecific “many” in his inauguration address.</p><p>Immigration experts have said they could not corroborate Mr. Trump’s claims of “millions” of criminal migrants. Nor is there any evidence that other countries were emptying prisons to send convicted criminals to the United States.</p><p>From the 2021 to 2024 fiscal years, border officials arrested <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-statistics" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 160,000 people</a> with criminal convictions or outstanding warrants at the southern border and official ports of entry.

But of the four criminal cases against Mr. Trump, two were brought by state or local prosecutors, meaning that the Justice Department under Mr. Biden had no control over them. His two other criminal cases were overseen by a special counsel, whom the former attorney general appointed to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. And there is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/us/politics/trump-cases-defense-fact-check.html" title="">no evidence</a> that Mr. Biden has personally directed any of those cases.</p><p>Moreover, Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/us/politics/trump-prison-threats-opponents.html" title="">repeatedly threatened to prosecute</a> or imprison his own political enemies. And in his first term, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/21/us/trump-opponents-investigations.html" title="">repeatedly sought to target his perceived foes</a> for investigation.</p><p>What Was Said</p><p><em>“China is operating the Panama Canal.”</em></p><p><strong>False. </strong>The Panama Canal is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an agency of Panama and governed by 11 members of a <a href="https://pancanal.com/en/board-of-directors/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">board of directors</a> — not China. The canal has been fully owned and administered by Panama since 1999, under a treaty negotiated by former President Jimmy Carter in the 1970s.</p><p>In a 1999 <a href="https://1997-2001.state.gov/regions/wha/panama/991206_faqs.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fact sheet</a> about the transfer of the canal from the United States’ control to Panama’s, the State Department noted that “the Panama Canal Authority will manage, operate and maintain the canal, its complementary works, installations and equipment, and will provide for the orderly transit of vessels through the canal.”</p><p>Mr. Trump, though, has a point that Washington officials are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/02/us/politics/trump-panama-canal-china.html" title="">increasingly concerned with China’s growing influence</a> over shipping and ports, including the canal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>What Was Said</p><p><em>“We offered her 10,000 soldiers, think of it, 10,000 soldiers.

Nor is there any evidence that his offer was rebuffed by Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House at the time. Mr. Trump had discussed a potential deployment in the days before — to protect himself and his supporters from counterprotesters, not to secure the Capitol, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/pdf/GPO-J6-REPORT.pdf#page=560" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the House Jan. 6 committee</a>.
