There have also been touring productions.</p><p>The end of the New York production was announced in a news release by Jack Kenn, the company’s managing director; the release did not say why the show was closing, and a spokeswoman for the company declined to provide any further information.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The closing at Astor Place Theater in Lower Manhattan comes at a challenging time for theater, as production costs are higher, and audience sizes generally lower, than before the pandemic.</p><p>Blue Man Group, which began performing at Astor Place in 1991, will conclude its New York run two years after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/04/theater/stomp-closing.html?smid=url-share" title="">the end of “Stomp,”</a> another wordless, percussion-heavy show that had been an Off Broadway staple since 1994. And “<a href="https://mckittrickhotel.com/events/sleep-no-more/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sleep No More</a>,” an immersive riff on Shakespeare’s “Macbeth” that opened in 2011, says its final performance will be Jan. 5. (It has previously postponed closing dates several times.)</p><p>Off Broadway has been a mixed bag since the 2020 shutdowns — many nonprofits are struggling, staging fewer shows and employing smaller casts than before. But in the commercial Off Broadway arena, there has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/theater/off-broadway-oh-mary-eddie-izzard.html?smid=url-share" title="">a rebound</a>, as a number of shows have found ways to break through and succeed.</p><p>Some producers now believe that limited run shows have better odds of success, because consumers are more motivated to buy tickets when they know it’s now or never.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>A new generation of long-running Off Broadway shows has arrived, although generally not with the longevity of Blue Man Group. A few examples: “<a href="https://www.broadwaygoeswrong.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Play That Goes Wrong</a>” transferred from Broadway to New World Stages in 2019 and is still running there; a revival of “<a href="https://littleshopnyc.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Little Shop of Horrors</a>” has been running at Westside Theater, also since 2019; and “<a href="https://newyork.titaniquemusical.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Titaníque</a>,” now at the Daryl Roth Theater, has been running Off Broadway since 2022.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
