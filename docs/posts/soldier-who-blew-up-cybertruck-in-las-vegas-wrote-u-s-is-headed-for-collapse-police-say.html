    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Assistant Sheriff Dori Koren of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said at a news conference on Friday that in the notes, Sergeant Livelsberger went on to “explain a variety of other grievances and issues — some political, some personal.”</p><p>Sergeant Livelsberger, 37, had been stationed in Germany and was back in the United States on leave.</p><p>“Why did I personally do it now? I needed to cleanse my mind of the brothers I’ve lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took,” Sergeant Livelsberger said in one of the notes, according to the police.</p><p>The New Year’s Day explosion, which occurred hours after a terrorist attack in New Orleans, raised fears that the two incidents were connected and that the incident in Las Vegas might be linked to a terrorist group.</p><p>Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas field office of the F.B.I., said on Friday that “we have not identified any connection between this subject and any other terrorist organization.”</p></div></div>
