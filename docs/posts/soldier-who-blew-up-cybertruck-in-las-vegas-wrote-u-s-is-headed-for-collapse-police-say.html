Matthew Alan Livelsberger, contained notes that said the country was “headed toward collapse,” the police said in a news briefing on Friday afternoon.</p><p>Sergeant Livelsberger fatally shot himself inside the Tesla on Wednesday as the explosives packed into the vehicle ignited and engulfed it in flames. The police said Sergeant Livelsberger, a veteran of several combat tours, had post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p>“This was not a terrorist attack,” the notes said. “It was a wake-up call. Americans only pay attention to spectacles and violence. What better way to get my point across than a stunt with fireworks and explosives?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Assistant Sheriff Dori Koren of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said at a news conference on Friday that in the notes, Sergeant Livelsberger went on to “explain a variety of other grievances and issues — some political, some personal.”</p><p>Sergeant Livelsberger, 37, had been stationed in Germany and was back in the United States on leave.</p><p>“Why did I personally do it now? I needed to cleanse my mind of the brothers I’ve lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took,” Sergeant Livelsberger said in one of the notes, according to the police.</p><p>The New Year’s Day explosion, which occurred hours after a terrorist attack in New Orleans, raised fears that the two incidents were connected and that the incident in Las Vegas might be linked to a terrorist group.</p><p>Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas field office of the F.B.I., said on Friday that “we have not identified any connection between this subject and any other terrorist organization.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He added that based on interviews with friends, relatives and military members Sergeant Livelsberger had served with, he held no animosity toward President-elect Donald J. Trump.</p><p>“Although this incident is more public and more sensational than usual, it ultimately appears to be a tragic case of suicide involving a heavily decorated combat veteran who is struggling with PTSD and other issues,” Mr. Evans said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jacey Fortin covers a wide range of subjects for the National desk of The Times, including extreme weather, court cases and state politics all across the country.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jacey-fortin">More about Jacey Fortin</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Across the U.S. With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters are exploring how America defines itself.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Deadly Toll on One Family: </strong>A large family suffered an unthinkable loss after landslides slammed into their North Carolina town during Hurricane Helene. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/us/hurricane-helene-craigtown-north-carolina-deaths.html">The survivors are trying to move forward</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mining Town Finds New Gold in Film: </strong>There was plenty of skepticism in Butte, Mont., when Hollywood producers began showing up to shoot their shows. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/28/us/butte-montana-filming-yellowstone-1923.html">Now, many say the industry’s arrival has been a boon</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Assist or Resist?: </strong>With President-elect Donald Trump pledging to carry out mass deportations, local officials around the country are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/25/us/trump-deportations-migrants-san-diego.html">divided on how much to cooperate with immigration agents</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Creating a Company Town: </strong>Over the past few years, Elon Musk has expanded his footprint in Texas.
