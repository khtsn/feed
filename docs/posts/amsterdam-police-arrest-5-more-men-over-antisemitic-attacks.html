people on assault charges this weekend, four of whom are still being held, over the attacks on Israeli soccer fans in the city late last week after a match between an Israeli and a Dutch team.</p><p>The total number of people who are still being held in connection to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/world/europe/israeli-soccer-fans-amsterdam-attack.html" title=""> the violence</a> is now eight, the police said, and more arrests were possible. The people arrested were all men ranging in age from 18 to 37. The police urged people to share any video footage as a way to aid their investigation.</p><p>On Monday afternoon, Dick Schoof, the prime minister of the Netherlands, told Dutch reporters that the perpetrators who attacked Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters in Amsterdam primarily had “a migration background.”</p><p>“We have an integration problem,” Mr. Schoof said. “This is an expression of that.”</p><p>Over the past year, tensions related to the war in Gaza have been high in Amsterdam, a city with a large Muslim population angered by Israel’s conduct in the conflict, which was set off by the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel. While most of the hundreds of Gaza-related protests in Amsterdam have been peaceful, some have turned turbulent. One disrupted the opening ceremony for the city’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/05/arts/design/holocaust-museum-the-netherlands.html" title="">new Holocaust museum</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Monday night, the unrest continued, with riot police officers responding to vandalism and people throwing fireworks, which set a tram on fire in a square in the western part of the city. The police urged people to stay away from the square.</p><p>Femke Halsema, Amsterdam’s mayor, sent a letter to the Amsterdam City Council on Monday expressing her stance on the unrest.</p><p>“What happened over the past few days is a toxic cocktail of antisemitism, hooligan behavior and anger over the war in Palestine and Israel, and other countries in the Middle East,” Ms. Halsema wrote, adding: “Antisemitism can’t be answered with other racism: The safety of one group cannot be at the expense of the safety of another.”</p><p>In neighboring Belgium, two boys — ages 14 and 17 — were arrested in Antwerp on Sunday and Monday, Antwerp officials said, for allegedly spreading calls on social media to attack Jewish residents in the city.</p><p>Five more people, who the police said were part of a gathering in response to online calls to target Jews, were also arrested, said Kristof Aerts, the spokesman for the Antwerp public prosecutor’s office. The five were released hours later without charges.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Antwerp police said they were continuing to monitor social media for additional incitements.</p><p>“In recent days, several messages have circulated on social media calling for violence reminiscent of what occurred in Amsterdam,” Wouter Bruyns, the spokesman for the Antwerp police, said in a statement on Monday. </p><p>The violence in Amsterdam last week unfolded during days of unrest tied to the soccer match on Thursday between Ajax, Amsterdam’s soccer team, and Maccabi Tel Aviv, an Israeli team. Tensions had risen a day earlier, when Israeli fans vandalized a taxi, burned a Palestinian flag in the city and chanted incendiary and racist slogans, according to the police.</p><p>Mr. Schoof said he condemned such behavior by the Maccabi fans but added that it was no excuse for the targeted attacks on Israelis, which he described as “unadulterated antisemitism.”</p><p>After the soccer game, groups of men, some riding scooters, kicked and beat Israeli fans, sending five people to the hospital and lightly wounding 20 to 30 others, in what the police described as “hit and run” attacks.</p><p>At least 12 videos verified by The New York Times depicted groups of men questioning, chasing or <a href="https://x.com/MichaelVis_/status/1854688414634762439" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">beating</a> people who were apparently targeted as Maccabi fans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“Nothing is an excuse for hunting Jews,” Mr. Schoof said. He added that his priorities were to fight antisemitism and to “arrest those people who did this.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The police and protesters clashed in the center of Amsterdam on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Robin Van Lonkhuijsen/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>By Friday, the police said, 63 people had been arrested, though all the arrests were made during the unrest before the match, rather than during its violent aftermath.</p><p>Amsterdam officials issued an emergency order, which has been extended until Thursday, that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/world/europe/amsterdam-israel-soccer-attacks.html" title="">bars any public protests</a> and empowers the police to search people on the street. </p><p>Mr. Schoof said that “tough measures” were planned, without giving details. He said the Dutch government would present a “broad” strategy to fight antisemitism by the end of the week, after a debate on Wednesday in the House of Representatives.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-9"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Claire Moses is a Times reporter in London, focused on coverage of breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/claire-moses">More about Claire Moses</a></span></p></div><div><p>Jenny Gross is a reporter for The Times covering Europe and other topics.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jenny-gross">More about Jenny Gross</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">The Israel Hamas War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/maccabi-tel-aviv">Maccabi Tel Aviv</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
