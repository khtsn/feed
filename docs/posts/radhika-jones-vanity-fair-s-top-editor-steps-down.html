Though many magazines have been shuttered or sold over the last decades, as advertising pages shrank, Vanity Fair has held on as a staple of Condé Nast, which also publishes Vogue and The New Yorker.</p><p>Ms. Jones started the job in December 2017, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/business/radhika-jones-vanity-fair.html" title="">succeeding</a> Graydon Carter, who retired that year after 25 years at the helm. Ms. Jones was something of a surprise choice to replace Mr. Carter. A former editorial director of the books department at The New York Times and a former top editor at Time magazine, Ms. Jones was picked for the top job over many of Mr. Carter’s top lieutenants.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
