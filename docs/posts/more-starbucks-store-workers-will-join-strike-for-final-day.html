By Monday, baristas in more than 50 stores in cities like Boston, Dallas, Denver, New York and Philadelphia did not report for work.</p><p>The strike spread to additional cities on Tuesday, union representatives said, as well as to additional stores in cities where some baristas were already on strike, potentially dampening business at one of the company’s busiest times of the year. Closed stores are expected to reopen on Wednesday, when workers have said they would return to work.</p><p>A typical company-owned Starbucks store in the United States brings in sales of <a href="https://investor.starbucks.com/news/financial-releases/news-details/2024/Starbucks-Reports-Q4-and-Full-Fiscal-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about $4,000 to $8,000</a> during a normal business day, according to a former company official and a review of company financial filings. The figures tend to be higher in December.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A Starbucks spokesman said on Monday he could not confirm the sales figure.</p><p>The union, Workers United, represents Starbucks employees at more than 500 company-owned stores across the country, about 5 percent of the U.S. total. It said it called the strike because Starbucks had yet to resolve more than 150 unfair-labor-practice charges on issues like retaliatory firings and cuts to hours, and because Starbucks had not offered a substantial wage increase during contract negotiations.</p><p>In the most recent bargaining session, which took place last week, the company offered to guarantee baristas a wage increase of at least 1.5 percent a year. If the company raised wages for all retail employees more than that — as it did with a recently announced 2 percent increase for the least experienced workers — unionized baristas would get the higher amount.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
