Operators of drones used for commercial purposes may apply for a waiver after providing a “valid statement of work,” the F.A.A. said.</p><p>The F.A.A. said in a statement that it had temporarily restricted drone flights over “critical New Jersey infrastructure” at the request of what it described as “federal security partners.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The F.A.A. referred all additional questions to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>“We continue to assess there is no public safety threat relating to the reported drone sightings,” Dana Gallagher, a Homeland Security spokeswoman, said in a statement. “In coordination with the F.A.A. and our critical infrastructure partners who requested temporary flight restrictions over their facilities, out of an abundance of caution, the F.A.A. has issued temporary flight restrictions over some critical infrastructure facilities in New Jersey.”</p><p>Pilots who fail to adhere to the no-fly rules may face swift consequences, including having drones intercepted and being questioned or detained by federal officials, <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap5_section_6.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">F.A.A. policies</a> state.</p><p>Many drones used for commercial purposes are registered with the federal government and can be traced using software. It was unclear, however, how hobbyists flying drones in forbidden airspace might be discovered.</p><p>The F.B.I. began investigating reports of drone sightings in New Jersey a month ago. Soon after, the authorities banned drones from operating near the Bedminster golf course run by President-elect Donald J. Trump and the Picatinny Arsenal, a large U.S. Army center.</p><p>Widespread news coverage followed. So, too, did thousands of additional reports of sightings over New Jersey, New York and several other states in the Northeast. Federal officials have issued repeated assurances that there is no security threat, and have said that most sightings appear to be of either airplanes or helicopters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>That has done little to assuage the public and some elected officials, including those who have speculated that the electronic devices are being used for nefarious reasons.</p><p>Representative Josh Gottheimer said he contacted the F.A.A. Thursday morning to express concern that, without more information, the decision to ban drones so broadly in New Jersey could lead to “more confusion and uncertainty.”</p><p>“They must brief the public on the reasons for their action,” said Mr. Gottheimer, a Democrat who represents a northern New Jersey district.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tracey Tully is a reporter for The Times who covers New Jersey, where she has lived for more than 20 years.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tracey-tully">More about Tracey Tully</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
