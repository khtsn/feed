Millions of civilians have lost sleep as they dragged themselves from bed to seek shelter in a subway, basement or apartment corridor. Others stay put and hope for the best.</p><p>In the attacks from Thursday night into Friday, 10 people were killed in Zaporizhzhia, including the toddler, local officials reported. The attacks wounded another 41 people, four of them children. According to Ivan Fedorov, regional governor of Zaporizhzhia, more than 130 houses and a hospital were damaged in five strikes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In another southern city, Odesa, one person was killed and nine wounded. Among the buildings damaged was a 19th-century school that had just been renovated before the war began in 2022. In the northeastern city of Kharkiv, 25 people were wounded by a missile that landed near a university campus, damaging a fountain and nearby buildings.</p><p>Ukraine’s air force said that Russia launched one ballistic missile, four cruise missiles and 92 exploding drones at Ukraine overnight.</p><p>The sleepless nights have pushed tired Ukrainians to discuss on social media — sometimes hopefully, often sarcastically — the possibilities of a quick negotiated end to the war, as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has promised.</p><p>“The end of the war! Can we start the countdown?” wrote Andriy Peretyazhko, a Kyiv resident who works in insurance, on his Facebook page.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Taking shelter in an underground crossing near the site of a Russian attack in Kharkiv on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sergey Kozlov/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Anastasia Chumachenko, 36, a mother of four who lives in Kyiv, said she really wanted to believe Trump’s pledge. “Our evil enemy for a number of years is throwing bombs at us every night,” she said in an interview. “I sleep in the hallway with my children. I am very tired.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ukrainian soldiers on the front line mostly responded to Trump’s election win with dark humor.</p><p>“We are waiting for the war to end within the next hour,” said a Ukrainian soldier who asked to be identified only by a nickname, Sam, in a voice message from his position near the eastern city of Pokrovsk, the most dangerous part of the front now.</p><p>Capt. Oleh Voitsekhovsky, who is fighting in the eastern Donbas region on a section of the front that is one of the few where Ukrainian forces have made some gains lately, said he was always closely monitoring the political situation in United States.</p><p>“We now have a whole new reality,” he said. “As of now, full responsibility for the situation in Ukraine and the Middle East lies with the Republicans and with Trump personally. Now he is responsible for everything. So we will see how will he stop the war in 24 hours, as he said.”</p><p>As of Thursday, Mr. Trump had spoken with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, but not with Russia’s President Vladimir V. Putin.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky has voiced skepticism about a quick resolution. “I believe President Trump wants a quick fix,” he said Thursday at a summit of European leaders in Budapest, Hungary. But “‘wants’ doesn’t mean it will turn out that way.”</p><p>Olha Konovalova<!-- --> contributed reporting from Kyiv.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>For Putin, Trump’s Win Is a New Opening:</strong> Russians close to the Kremlin voiced optimism that Donald J.
