It has portrayed itself as an alternative to what it calls American hegemony and bullying, casting itself as a more sympathetic, fellow developing country.</p><p>And with significant investments in port construction worldwide, China is positioning itself to influence global commerce and monitor international activities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Specifically, U.S. officials have grown increasingly concerned about two seaports at each end of the Panama Canal, which have been operated for decades by CK Hutchison Holdings, a company based in Hong Kong.</p><p>While CK Hutchison is a publicly listed conglomerate whose largest owner is a Hong Kong billionaire family, Beijing could still use its national security laws to force the company to assist in intelligence-gathering or military operations.</p><p>Panamanian officials argue, however, that China doesn’t pose a risk. The canal is open to the public, they say, and any Chinese interference would be visibly obvious.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People marching through Panama City on Martyr’s Day.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At a grave this month during a commemoration of 21 people who died protesting the American occupation in 1964.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“Anyone can use a satellite to see what is going in and out of the port,” Ilya Espino de Marotta, the deputy administrator of the Panama Canal, said in an interview last week. “The canal runs through the country, along national roads and is visible to the public.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>During his first administration, Mr. Trump did bring up the Panama Canal internally, indicating that he sees the waterway as unfinished business, said John Feeley, who served as U.S. ambassador to Panama from 2015 until 2018.</p><p>In June 2017, Mr. Trump met with the Panamanian president at the time, Juan Carlos Varela, and complained that the U.S. Navy was paying too much to traverse the canal — about $1 million annually, Mr. Feeley said. (That cost is so minuscule it would be akin to a rounding error in the Pentagon’s budget, analysts say.)</p><p>But Mr. Trump never brought up China’s presence or supposed influence over the canal even though just weeks previously Panama had broken off relations with Taiwan and aligned with Beijing, said Mr. Feeley, who attended the White House meeting between the leaders.</p><p>The former ambassador said he tried to get the White House to focus on China’s rising influence in Panama, but the issue never grew to a level of serious alarm.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>At the time, China was promising to invest in big-ticket infrastructure items in Panama, including a canal bridge, as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. Through the initiative Beijing has increased its influence globally by investing in seaports, roads and trains from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/07/world/africa/kenya-election-train.html" title="">Kenya</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/world/asia/china-sri-lanka-port.html" title="">Sri Lanka</a> and, most recently, Latin America. Critics say Beijing uses the program to saddle foreign governments with failing projects or unsustainable debt in order to wield China’s leverage.</p><p>Mr. Feeley said he tried to get American companies to bid on such projects to counter China. But the U.S. Embassy in Panama City never got the White House’s backing to persuade American companies to bid, he said.</p><p>“It’s not that we are losing to China in Latin America; in most cases we aren’t even showing up to the commercial battlefield,” Mr. Feeley said.</p><p>Latin American governments like Panama’s have complained that when they put out bids for expensive infrastructure projects, the United States is often absent, forcing them to rely on others from Europe to China to get the work done.</p><p>“The U.S. isn’t bidding on big infrastructure projects here, but China is,” said Giulia de Sanctis, the president of the Panamanian Association of Business Executives. “Are we supposed to tell them now: ‘It’s time to get out of Panama; Trump doesn’t like you.’ Would anyone feel safe investing here then?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The Panama Canal Authority has said that while the United States built the canal for military purposes, the Panamanians developed it into a major hub of global trade.</p><p>Once the U.S. military handed it over, the authority invested more than $5 billion to widen the waterway and accommodate the giant cargo ships that travel from the United States to East Asia, its most popular route.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Vast numbers of shipping containers along the Panama Canal this month.

At the Atlantic entrance of the canal, three ports are separately operated by companies based in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the United States, she said.</p><p>“These ports have been managed by Hong Kong since 1997, throughout Trump’s first administration,” she added. “Trump never said a thing about it then, so why now?”</p><p>Some Panamanians are reluctant to allow China to invest further in the country. Although Mr. Varela shifted Panama’s diplomatic recognition to China from Taiwan and entered into several business agreements with Beijing, subsequent governments have sought to scale back these commitments.</p><p>Ramón Martínez, who served as the minister of commerce after Mr. Varela stepped down, expressed his discomfort with the political and economic agreements made by the earlier administration with China. He said he halted a free-trade agreement with China that was under negotiation. The bridge over the canal that China pledged to build was also paused.</p><p>Mr. Martínez emphasized that for Panama, its most important ally will always be the United States.</p><p>Last week, hundreds of tourists gathered on a terrace at the Miraflores Visitors Center, giving them a bird’s-eye view of the Panama Canal. They waved as a towering cruise ship squeezed its way through the canal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“At first it made me laugh, the insanity of it all,” said Jacqueline Williams of Mr. Trump’s threats against Panama as she waved to a passing cruise ship. The 67-year-old nonprofit educator was visiting the canal from New York City.</p><p>“But then you think: This is a guy who idolizes Putin,” she said, referring to the Russian president. “Trump said on the campaign trail he wanted to restore peace to the world, but now he is threatening military expansionism.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tourists gathered to watch a cruise ship passing through the Panama Canal this month.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>Alex E.
