Kennedy Jr. fell ill on a flight to Rapid City, S.D. The pilot radioed ahead for medics. By dint of his famous name, Mr. Kennedy, then 29 and fresh out of law school, was taken to a V.I.P. room at the airport, where investigators found heroin in his luggage.</p><p>By his own account, Mr. Kennedy, who later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/18/us/robert-kennedy-jr-admits-he-is-guilty-in-possessing-heroin.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">pleaded guilty</a> to a felony charge of possessing heroin, had become addicted to the drug in his teens, as he struggled to cope with the assassination of his father. Two days after the airplane episode, he checked himself into a New Jersey drug treatment center. He says he has been sober ever since.</p><p>Now Mr. Kennedy is President-elect Donald J. Trump’s pick to be health secretary, a nomination he landed after a renegade presidential campaign in which he cast his life as a redemption story. He told a conservative Christian radio host this year that as an addicted and troubled young man he had undergone a “spiritual awakening” and “knew he had to change at a deep, fundamental way.”</p><p>Yet Mr. Kennedy’s early fight for sobriety was far from the end of his battles with demons and self-destructive impulses. An examination of his life, gleaned through interviews with more than a dozen people, court filings and his own statements, reveals his distinct pattern of cycling through extremes — including his early drug addiction, compulsive sexual behavior and deep dives into conspiracy theories — all while under the microscope of fame.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At midlife, Mr. Kennedy won public acclaim as a crusading environmental lawyer who sued corporate polluters, cleaned up rivers and lobbied to protect New York’s drinking water. But he was also a serial philanderer <a href="https://nypost.com/2013/09/08/rfk-jr-s-sex-diary-of-adultery/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who kept a journal chronicling his encounters and assigned numerical scores to women</a>, even as he berated himself for his inability to control his actions.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/business/media/olivia-nuzzi-rfk-jr.html" title="">His infidelities</a> contributed to the breakup of his second marriage, according to interviews with people who knew the couple. A former nanny who worked for his family during this time also has accused Mr. Kennedy of making sexual overtures toward her and touching her without consent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/01/multimedia/00pol-RFK-profile-bwvq/00pol-RFK-profile-bwvq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/01/multimedia/00pol-RFK-profile-bwvq/00pol-RFK-profile-bwvq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/01/multimedia/00pol-RFK-profile-bwvq/00pol-RFK-profile-bwvq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Robert F.

He has promoted wild and debunked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/rfk-conspiracy-theories-fact-check.html" title="">theories</a>, suggesting AIDS could be caused by “<a href="https://x.com/patriottakes/status/1671161500495646724" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poppers</a>,” an inhaled drug popularized by gay men in the 1970s, rather than H.I.V. He backed a documentary asserting that the 2020 pandemic was a <a href="https://x.com/patriottakes/status/1859282403262415068?t=9ClBWvnhh5uMKhDFeOpcPg&amp;s=19" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“plandemic”</a> — an event orchestrated by the government as part of an effort to undermine American liberties.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy declined a request for an interview. Friends and close associates say his choices are best understood as a quest to live up to the legacy of his father and namesake, Robert F. Kennedy, the former attorney general, senator and liberal icon who was assassinated while running for president in 1968.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>One friend, who like many others interviewed for this article declined to be named, said Mr. Kennedy’s self-aggrandizing drive to emulate his father was a “tragic flaw” that gave rise to “the need for adulation, the need for recognition, the need for followers.” The younger Mr. Kennedy has long embraced his family mythology and imagined himself as a new hero.</p><p>“Everything that has happened in my life,” Mr. Kennedy said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guw1fLJs5EY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a campaign video,</a> “has led me to where I am right now — the deaths, the tragedies, the addiction, the recovery, finding a deep belief in God.”</p><p>But the road Mr. Kennedy has traveled led him to an alliance with a man his family and fellow Democrats regard as anathema. Mr. Trump brought him into his fold to consolidate his base, and Mr. Kennedy entered, telling uneasy allies it was his best chance of effecting real change.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kennedy is President-elect Donald J.

His sister Kerry Kennedy says her brother has “set fire” to their father’s legacy and called the decision to back Mr. Trump “a sad ending to a sad story.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Close friends and supporters bristle at media portrayals of Mr. Kennedy as crazy or a crank — they see him as a revolutionary, speaking truth to power. They also say he should not be defined by addiction, but by recovery: They note he is disciplined and focused. He has thrown himself into exercise and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/16/us/politics/robert-kennedy-diet-eating-habits-trump.html" title="">adheres to a strict diet</a> known as intermittent fasting. More than 40 years after the flight to South Dakota, he <a href="https://www.instagram.com/robertfkennedyjr/reel/C8PwEpMPYiW/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">still attends</a> daily 12-step meetings, he says.</p><p>Del Bigtree, his former communications director, described Mr. Kennedy as deeply spiritual, and said he feels “called to make a difference.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/business/de-becker-bezos.html" title="">Gavin de Becker,</a> Mr. Kennedy’s security consultant and close adviser, said Mr. Kennedy’s sobriety is a source of his “stamina and commitment and resilience” — “an absolute golden qualification,” he said, for a health secretary.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy himself leans into his troubled past. “I got so many skeletons in my closet,” he said while campaigning for president, “that if they could vote, I could be king of the world.”</p><h2 id="link-1f08d5e6">A Complex Inheritance</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kennedy handling a bird in Kenya in August 1975 for a television special.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bettmann Archive/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Bobby Kennedy was 9 years old when an uncle, President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated in Dallas. The third of his parents’ 11 children, Bobby wanted to be a scientist or a veterinarian.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Five years later, in June 1968, his father was killed. He was 14. That fall, he entered ninth grade at <a href="https://www.millbrook.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Millbrook,</a> a boys’ boarding school in New York’s Hudson Valley. The school was isolated and bucolic; Mr. Kennedy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/19/us/politics/rfk-jr-ravens.html" title="">fascinated by animals</a>, was attracted to its small zoo.</p><p>His classmates remember him as a falconer, and a troublemaker who sometimes veered into cruelty. Allen Low, now a retired airline pilot in San Francisco, recalled how one evening, when it was Mr. Low’s turn to clean the table, Mr. Kennedy took his cigarette lighter and heated the handle of his fork, so that whoever picked it up would get burned.</p><p>“I picked up the fork and of course burned my hand,” Mr. Low said. “I’ll never forget his laugh when he saw my pain.”</p><p>In 1970, when he was 16, Mr. Kennedy was expelled from Millbrook for drug use, according to his memoir “American Values: Lessons I Learned From My Family.” That summer, he was arrested for marijuana possession in Massachusetts. The following summer he was arrested again, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1971/08/24/archives/robert-kennedy-17-fined-for-loitering-pleads-no-contest.html?searchResultPosition=8" title="">accused of spitting ice cream in a police officer’s face</a>. He denied the accusation but paid a fine.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy cycled through two more high schools before graduating, and despite his troubles, was able to follow in his father’s footsteps to Harvard.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>He continued to battle a growing drug addiction — a problem that plagued other family members, including a younger brother, David, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/17/us/3-drugs-are-blamed-in-david-kennedy-case.html" title="">died in 1984 after ingesting cocaine</a> and other drugs, and his <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/26/kennedy-addiction-mental-health-00160036" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cousin Patrick</a>, who served in Congress and is today an advocate for people with mental illness and drug addiction.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/08/rfk-jr-endorse-trump-execute-drug-dealers/679597/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One Harvard classmate remembers buying cocaine</a> from Mr. Kennedy when they were in college. At some point Mr. Kennedy contracted hepatitis C by sharing needles, he said in a 2023 interview with The New York Times.</p><p>After graduating with honors in American history from Harvard, he went on to law school at the University of Virginia — again, as his father had done. “When he died, I felt kind of an obligation to pick up the torch that he had dropped,” Mr. Kennedy said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guw1fLJs5EY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a video produced for his presidential campaign</a>, “and so I changed my career trajectory to align it more with his.”</p><p>In 1982, Mr. Kennedy, then 28, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/28/nyregion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-hired-by-morgenthau.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">landed a plum job in the Manhattan district attorney’s office</a>, but had to resign when he failed the bar exam. Then came his arrest and conviction for heroin possession. He was sentenced to two years’ probation and community service.</p><p>By the time Mr. Kennedy arrived at the <a href="https://www.openspaceinstitute.org/about" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Open Space Institute</a>, a land preservation organization, to complete his service work, he was visibly unhealthy, according to one person who knew him then. He was missing at least one front tooth. He chewed tobacco and left cups of tobacco juice everywhere, this person said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>In “American Values,” Mr. Kennedy recalls apologizing to his mother, during a swim in Nantucket Sound, for the anguish his drug use had caused her and “for falling short of my father’s ideals, of hers, and of my own.”</p><h2 id="link-54e61e40">Being ‘the Kennedy Who Matters’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kennedy in 1995, while he was a professor at Pace University.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The institute put Mr. Kennedy to work, helping renovate an old farmhouse in Garrison, N.Y. The house was later rented by the Hudson Riverkeeper, a group dedicated to cleaning up the polluted Hudson River. Mr. Kennedy became passionate about its cause and soon signed on.</p><p>Once he was admitted to the bar, in 1985, he got a master’s of law in environmental studies. He kept a low profile at first, but by the early 1990s, he was back in the spotlight, his name a magnet for reporters. He seemed to embrace it.</p><p>In 1995, New York magazine crowned him “<a href="https://jenniferrobin.gallery/the-kennedy-who-matters/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Kennedy Who Matters.</a>” He circulated the article widely, according to someone who knew him at the time. In 1997, he was a contestant on “Celebrity Jeopardy!” Rumors began to swirl that he might run for a U.S. Senate seat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>At his office at Pace University, where he got his master’s and ran the environmental litigation clinic, the wall was covered with photos of him posing with celebrities. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/10/style/cheryl-hines-robert-f-kennedy-jr.html" title="">He would eventually marry one</a>, the actress Cheryl Hines, his third wife.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy became a nationally recognized environmental lawyer. In 1999 he was named a hero of the planet by Time magazine for his work with the Riverkeeper organization.</p><p>He worked alongside other lawyers on a number of high-profile cases. In 2007 he delivered the closing arguments in a case that resulted in a $382 million judgment against DuPont. A jury <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/us/13lawsuit.html" title="">ruled the company</a> deliberately exposed thousands of people who lived near its zinc-smelting plant in Spelter, W.Va., to toxic levels of arsenic, cadmium and lead.</p><p>He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/us/rfk-jr-finances.html" title="">parlayed his successes and the resulting attention into a perch on the speaking circuit</a>. He was earning about $25,000 a speech, but could charge as much as $250,000 for a talk overseas, according to confidential court records reviewed by The Times.</p><p>He also created discord at Riverkeeper. Mr. Kennedy became the dominant force — and face — of the group. He dug in on controversial and odd choices, once insisting on hiring a man who had been convicted of smuggling rare bird eggs from Australia. The decision tore apart the organization, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/22/nyregion/eight-at-riverkeeper-resign-over-kennedy-s-hiring-of-a-rare-egg-smuggler.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">triggering the resignation</a> of much of the board, including Robert Boyle, the association’s founder and president. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>“I thought he was thinking of himself and not the cause of the river,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/05/nyregion/a-kennedy-and-his-mentor-part-ways-over-river-group.html" title="">Mr. Boyle said at the time.</a> “It all became his own greater glory.”</p><h2 id="link-d569f41">‘Wild Impulses’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kennedy was also a serial philanderer who reportedly kept a journal chronicling his encounters.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>In the mid-1990s, his first marriage, to Emily Black, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/04/us/robert-f-kennedy-jr-weds-law-classmate.html" title="">law school classmate,</a> fell apart. And soon after the divorce was official, Mr. Kennedy married Mary Richardson, a close friend of his sister Kerry.</p><p>The tensions in his second marriage were apparent immediately to Eliza Cooney, who in 1998, at 23, moved to New York to work with Mr. Kennedy at Pace — an offer that included room and board, commuting to the office with Mr. Kennedy and working as his children’s weekend nanny.</p><p>She has since described — <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/robert-kennedy-jr-shocking-history?srsltid=AfmBOoqVbqRdWmacy6eXPTgwzdCiZyJ9f4qeFzmwq6lJOE9HWTs2msjs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in an article in Vanity Fair,</a> and in interviews with The Times — several instances in which Mr. Kennedy, then in his mid-40s, made physical passes at her: During a meeting with a Pace colleague in the family kitchen, he moved his hand up and down her leg, she has said. Once, he came into her room, shirtless, and asked her to rub lotion on his back. And once, he stepped into the kitchen pantry behind her and moved his hands up and down the sides of her torso, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Mr. Kennedy declined to comment on the claims. When her allegations first surfaced this summer, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/12/us/politics/kennedy-sexual-assault-accusation.html" title="">sent an apologetic text message</a> to Ms. Cooney, saying he had no memory of the episodes.</p><p>Ms. Cooney said she was repulsed by the behavior, and left the household by the end of one year, though she continued her work at Pace and stayed in touch with the family. She says she was troubled by the entitlement and carelessness of his behavior.</p><p>“I remember thinking, in the beginning of my tenure there — Wow, it’s as if he’s up on the bow of a large, fast boat, and the rest of us are on board,” she said. “He gets to be in the front, look ahead, think big, holler commands, jump off, do what he wants, without concern for details or implications, while everybody else is there to deal with the wake.”</p><p>As part of his 12-step recovery programs, Mr. Kennedy kept a journal. In it, he chronicled sexual encounters with more than three dozen women in a one-year period in around 2001, assigning them rankings, 1 to 10, that corresponded with different sexual acts, <a href="https://nypost.com/2013/09/08/rfk-jr-s-sex-diary-of-adultery/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The New York Post reported.</a> The journal reportedly includes entries suggesting his behavior filled him with self-loathing.</p><p>“After daddy died I struggled to be a grown-up,” Mr. Kennedy wrote, adding, “I felt he was watching me from heaven. Every time I was afflicted with sexual thoughts, I felt a failure. I hated myself. I began to lie — to make up a character who was the hero and leader that I wished I was.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Mr. Kennedy filed for divorce nine years later. Ms. Richardson, who struggled with depression and alcohol abuse, died by suicide in 2012, at age 52. She hanged herself in a barn on the family property in Westchester County, N.Y. Her death, and Mr. Kennedy’s public falling out with Ms. Richardson’s family, brought a stream of negative press attention to Mr. Kennedy.</p><p>By then, he was taking his activism in a new direction.</p><h2 id="link-5ea78588">Battling the Public Health Establishment</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-31"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kennedy posing with the crowd at an anti-vaccine rally in Albany in 2019.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Desiree Rios for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>One summer in the early 2000s, Sarah Bridges, a Minnesota psychologist who had gone to college with a sister-in-law of Mr. Kennedy, showed up unannounced at his home at the family compound in Hyannis Port, Mass. Ms. Bridges said her son had suffered a brain injury and received an autism diagnosis, after being vaccinated with a pertussis vaccine that is no longer in use in the United States.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy had been working on getting mercury out of waterways; Ms. Bridges wanted him to investigate <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4826a3.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thimerosal,</a> a mercury-based preservative that has been <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/thimerosal-vaccines-questions-and-answers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">largely removed</a> from childhood vaccines in the United States. When Mr. Kennedy resisted, she brought a stack of scientific studies to his door.</p><p>“He said, ‘I have no interest, none’ — he was very adamant, and he said, ‘Furthermore, I have houseguests and I need to go sailing,’” she recalled. She waited until he returned; he finally agreed to look at the research if she would agree to leave.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>Once he dived in, there was no stopping him. Using “my name and my family’s relationships,” he said in <a href="https://freedomlibrary.hillsdale.edu/programs/cca-iv-big-pharma/anthony-fauci-and-the-public-health-establishment" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a speech at Hillsdale College</a>, he secured meetings with Dr. Anthony S.

The core of his message — that the federal government was bent on restricting personal liberties, and that pharmaceutical companies were seeking to profit off a crisis — suddenly appealed to a new audience of Americans frustrated by lockdowns and skeptical about a vaccine that was developed and marketed at an extraordinarily fast pace — albeit for a virus that was killing thousands of Americans each day.</p><p>Traffic to the Children’s Health Defense website exploded.
