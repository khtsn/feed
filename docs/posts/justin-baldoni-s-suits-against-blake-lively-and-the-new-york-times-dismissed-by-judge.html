Liman of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, is the latest twist in a star-studded legal battle over the making and marketing of the 2024 film “It Ends With Us,” and a major setback for Mr. Baldoni.</p><p>The actor filed a $400 million lawsuit against Ms. Lively and Mr. Reynolds in January, accusing the Hollywood stars of trying to destroy his reputation by accusing him of sexual harassment and retaliation on the set of the film, which he directed and starred in.</p><p>Mr. Baldoni named the couple’s publicist, Leslie Sloane, and her company as defendants. He later added The Times as a defendant, arguing that <a href="https://8cmbykf0.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2024%2F12%2F21%2Fbusiness%2Fmedia%2Fblake-lively-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us.html/1/0100019755c76c2d-bd333f73-feb7-4ebc-9354-efb9b02db21d-000000/dlIDWBqjO5O3jDqPNmSWG13qwdw=429" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Dec. 21 article</a> published by the news organization about Ms. Lively’s accusations had defamed him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/business/media/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us.html" title="">article</a> reported on a legal filing to the California Civil Rights Department in which Ms. Lively accused Mr. Baldoni and Jamey Heath, the lead producer, of harassment on the set. Ms. Lively said in her complaint, which also named the pair’s company, Wayfarer Studios, that they had launched a retaliatory smear campaign against her after she complained, out of concern that those complaints would become public.</p><p>Days later, Ms. Lively sued Mr. Baldoni. Her lawsuit is proceeding.</p><p>The dispute between the two lead actors has absorbed Hollywood and made for constant tabloid fodder, far overshadowing the film at the center of it. Fans of both actors have pored over every detail in the lengthy competing lawsuits and shared their takes on social media.</p><p>The legal back and forth even ensnared Taylor Swift, a friend of Ms. Lively’s, who was subpoenaed by Mr. Baldoni’s lawyers after he accused her of pressuring him to accept Ms. Lively’s changes to the film’s script. Mr. Baldoni included text messages in his complaint that appeared to show Ms. Lively referring to Ms. Swift as one of her “dragons.” (The subpoena was withdrawn, and Ms. Swift’s spokesperson has said she had no involvement in the film.)</p><p>Mr. Baldoni has denied any wrongdoing, and said in his complaint that Ms. Lively had used her grievances to try to wrest creative control of the film, which is based on a novel by Colleen Hoover and explores the challenges of escaping domestic abuse. He argued that The Times’s article had deliberately taken some text messages sent between the parties “out of context to bolster a fallacious narrative.”</p><p>Judge Liman said in his ruling that Mr. Baldoni’s suit had not adequately shown that Ms. Lively’s demands that the studio add more safeguards before she returned to the set, or her refusal to promote the film unless she was given more creative control, amounted to “wrongful extortion,” as asserted by Mr. Baldoni.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Baldoni’s legal team had not shown that Ms. Lively had defamed him, the judge added, because the suit failed to claim that Ms. Lively had made any alleged defamatory comments outside of her Civil Rights Department complaint, which are covered by privilege.</p><p>Judge Liman ruled that many of The Times’s statements were also privileged because they had been taken from Ms. Lively’s legal filing. He went on to say Mr. Baldoni had not shown that The Times acted with actual malice — the legal standard a public figure like Mr. Baldoni must meet to prove libel — in publishing the article.</p><p>“The Times had no obvious motive to favor Lively’s version of events,” he wrote.</p><p>The judge added that while a quoted exchange in the article might have been taken out of context, “given the strength of the evidence in favor of a smear campaign, it is not plausible that The Times ‘entertained serious doubts as to the truth.’”</p><p>Ms. Lively’s lawyers, Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb, said in a statement that Monday’s decision was “a total victory and a complete vindication for Blake Lively, along with those that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer parties dragged into their retaliatory lawsuit.”</p><p>Charlie Stadtlander, a spokesman for The Times, said, “We are grateful to the court for seeing the lawsuit for what it was: a meritless attempt to stifle honest reporting. Our journalists went out and covered carefully and fairly a story of public importance, and the court recognized that the law is designed to protect just that sort of journalism.”</p><p>A representative for Mr. Baldoni did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>While dismissing the claims of extortion and defamation, Judge Liman said Mr. Baldoni’s legal team could refile amended complaints against Ms. Lively related to contractual obligations.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>B</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>3</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Judge Dismisses Baldoni’s Suit Against Lively and Reynolds<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
