Two attackers, a man and a woman, were seen rushing into a building with backpacks and assault rifles. Special Forces were deployed, and the police sealed off the area before the government limited local news coverage to official statements. </p><p>Selim Cirpanoglu, the mayor of the district where the attack took place, told Turkish news media that hostages had been taken in a cafeteria inside the compound. Late Wednesday, it was not clear how or whether that issue had been resolved.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Speaking to reporters near the site, Defense Minister Yasar Guler also suggested that the Kurdistan Worker’s Party, or P.K.K., was behind the assault.</p><p>“We inflict the necessary punishment on those ignoble P.K.K. members, but they never wisen up,” Mr. Guler said.</p><p>The P.K.K. has been seeking Kurdish autonomy through a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state that has left tens of thousands of people dead. Turkey and its Western allies consider the P.K.K. a terrorist organization.</p><p>No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack on Wednesday, but Turkey has faced similar attacks in recent years from Kurdish separatists, radical leftists and jihadists from the Islamic State. </p><p>One video from the scene that was aired on Turkish television networks before the broadcast restrictions were imposed showed gray smoke from what appeared to be an explosion and a man who appeared to be an attacker running with an assault rifle. Images from surveillance cameras inside a building showed two attackers near the entrance to a building and a body lying on the pavement outside.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>NetBlocks, a group that tracks internet outages, <a href="https://x.com/netblocks/status/1849105056081068206" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that major social media platforms including X, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and TikTok had been restricted in Turkey.</p><p>Turkish Aerospace Industries was founded to decrease Turkey’s dependence on foreign defense companies and is a major employer that produces parts for airplanes, helicopters, drones and other technologies.</p><p>The attack came a day after one of Mr. Erdogan’s closest political allies said during a televised address to Parliament that Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned head of the P.K.K., could be released if he announced the end of his group’s insurgency.</p><p>Mr. Ocalan is serving a life sentence in an island prison near Istanbul. The surprising offer of a release suggested the possibility of new movement in long-dormant peace talks between Turkey and the P.K.K.</p><p>Dem Party, Turkey’s main pro-Kurdish political party, condemned the attack and suggested that it could have been launched by people seeking to prevent talks.</p><p>“We find it noteworthy that such an attack happened in these days when Turkish society is talking about a solution and the possibility of dialogue emerged,” the party said in a statement on social media.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Alone in the Dark: </strong>In Bangladesh’s secret underground prison, political captives were pushed to the brink of insanity and death. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/asia/bangladesh-disappeared.html">Some are telling their stories</a> now that the woman who put them there, Sheikh Hasina, is gone.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Panda Factories: </strong>In the 1990s, China began sending pandas to foreign zoos to be bred, in the hope that future generations could be released into nature. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/15/world/asia/pandas-zoo-breeding-death-captivity.html">It hasn’t gone as planned</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Saving Democracy or Hurting It?: </strong>Brazil’s Supreme Court expanded its power to protect democracy in the country.
