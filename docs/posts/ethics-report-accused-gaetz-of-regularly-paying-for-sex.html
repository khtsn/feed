It concluded that Gaetz violated Florida’s sexual misconduct laws and House rules. In 2017, the report said, Gaetz “engaged in sexual activity with a 17-year-old girl,” who was paid. It also accused Gaetz of using or possessing illegal drugs, including cocaine and Ecstasy, “on multiple occasions,” and of accepting lavish gifts.
