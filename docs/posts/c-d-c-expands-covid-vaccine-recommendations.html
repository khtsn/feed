    <h1>C.D.C. Expands Covid Vaccine Recommendations</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“If the person is willing to get it, great — we now have the green light to give it to them, in no uncertain terms,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.</p><p>Not everyone, of course, will be willing: Covid vaccine uptake has remained stubbornly low over the last few years. As of Oct. 12, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/covidvaxview/interactive/vaccination-dashboard.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">only around 12 percent</a> of adults reported receiving an updated vaccine, according to data from the C.D.C.</p><p>The vaccines are well matched against the variants that are currently circulating, offering some defense against infection and curbing a person’s risk of hospitalization or death from the virus. Vaccines also reduce a person’s chances of developing long Covid. But immunity wanes over time.</p><p>“There’s just a greater need than ever to have a more durable strategy, vaccination-wise,” said Dr. Marc Sala, co-director of the Northwestern Medicine Comprehensive Covid-19 Center in Chicago.</p><p>Covid poses a particular challenge because the virus spreads year-round, spiking in unpredictable waves; it’s difficult to sustain protection, especially among people with compromised immune systems. The C.D.C.’s new recommendations signal a shift in how the medical community thinks about vaccinations, Dr. Schaffner said.</p></div></div>
