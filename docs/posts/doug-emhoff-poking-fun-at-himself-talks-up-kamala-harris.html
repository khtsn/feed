We worked through the issue, and by the end of the meeting, the now happy client offered to set me up on a blind date — [laughter] which is how I ended up with Kamala Harris’s phone number. Now, for generations, people have debated when to call the person you’re being set up with. And never in history has anyone suggested 8:30 a.m. And yet, that’s when I dialed. I got Kamala’s voicemail, and I just started rambling. “Hey, it’s Doug. I’m on my way to an early meeting. Again, it’s Doug.” I remember I was trying to grab the words out of the air and just put them back in my mouth. And for what seemed like far too many minutes, I hung up. By the way, Kamala saved that voicemail, and she makes me listen to it on every anniversary.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/20/multimedia/20election-live-emhoffsub2-photo-qbzt/20election-live-emhoffsub2-photo-qbzt-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Doug Emhoff told the story of how he met Kamala Harris and left her a voice mail message that she saved — and makes him listen to every year on their anniversary.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/erica-l-green"><img alt="Erica L.

Soon after Mr. Biden dropped out of the race, Ms. Harris took the helm of the party, infusing enthusiasm and quickly reversing its fortunes.</p><p>“That’s who she is,” Mr. Emhoff said. “Whenever she’s needed, however she’s needed, Kamala rises to the occasion.”</p><p>Like other convention speakers who have been charged with reintroducing Ms. Harris to the American public, Mr. Emhoff pointed to her personal attributes and humanity. He said he had fallen in love with Ms. Harris the more he learned what drove her.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“It is what you have seen over these past four years and especially these past four weeks,” he said. “She finds joy in pursuing justice. She stands up to bullies just like my parents taught me to. She likes to see people do well, but hates when they are treated unfairly. She believes this work requires a curiosity in how people are doing. Her empathy is her strength.” </p><p>He also engaged in some self-deprecation, telling a story about how, fresh off a divorce and trying to navigate life with two children, he was presented with Ms. Harris’s phone number and the prospect of a blind date.</p><p>He decided, he said sheepishly, to call her at 8:30 in the morning, only to reach her voice mail. “Hey, it’s Douuuuugg” he recalled saying, before he “just started rambling.”</p><p>He said she saved the message, and now makes him listen to it every year on their anniversary. He is set to listen to it again on Thursday, the couple’s 10th wedding anniversary, which happens to be the day Ms. Harris will give her acceptance speech as the first Black woman to accept the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination.</p><p>Ms. Harris married Mr. Emhoff in 2014 and, she has said, took on the role of “Momala” to his children, Cole and Ella. Their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/us/politics/jd-vance-kamala-harris-childless.html" title="">blended family has taken a united front</a> in the campaign, coming to Ms. Harris’s defense against personal attacks lodged by former President Donald J. Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Emhoff was introduced by his son, Cole, who concluded his introduction of his father by saying, “We might not look like other families in the White House, but we are ready to represent all families in America.”</p><p>Even before Mr. Biden dropped out of the race, Doug Emhoff had become a staple on the campaign trail with Ms. Harris, accompanying her on trips across the country and rallying crowds around her campaign message of “freedom.”</p><p>Mr. Emhoff has also been a fierce defender of his wife.</p><p>“That’s all he’s got?” Mr. Emhoff asked last month after Mr. Trump ramped up his attacks, mocking her laugh and competency, days after she announced her intent to seek the presidential nomination.</p><p>In his speech on Tuesday, Mr. Emhoff, who is Jewish and has taken on a prominent role in speaking out about antisemitism in the wake of the attacks by Hamas last October, said that Ms. Harris had connected him more deeply to his faith.</p><p>“America, in this election, you have to decide who to trust with your family’s future,” he said. “I trusted Kamala with our family’s future. It was the best decision I ever made.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
