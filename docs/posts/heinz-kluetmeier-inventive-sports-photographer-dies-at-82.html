    <h1>Heinz Kluetmeier, Inventive Sports Photographer, Dies at 82</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Heinz Kluetmeier, a prominent photographer for Sports Illustrated who captured the exultation of the United States men’s Olympic hockey team when it upset the Soviet Union at the 1980 Winter Games and the swimmer Michael Phelps’s minuscule margin of victory in a gold medal race at the 2008 Summer Olympics, died on Tuesday at his loft in Manhattan. He was 82.</p><p>His daughter Jessica Kluetmeier said the cause was complications of Parkinson’s disease.</p><p>For decades, even as television imagery grew more influential, Sports Illustrated’s star photographers, including Mr. Kluetmeier, Neil Leifer and Walter Iooss Jr., provided sports fans with weekly doses of sharp-eyed action shots and portraits.</p><p>“Heinz wanted to bring people to a place or an angle they had never seen before,” said Marguerite Schroop Lucarelli, the magazine’s director of photography. “He also had a unique ability to connect with athletes.”</p><p>On Feb. 22, 1980, Mr. Kluetmeier found the perfect angle at the Lake Placid Olympic Center to chronicle the underdog U.S. hockey team’s 4-3 semifinal victory over the Soviet squad. (In their next game, the Americans beat Finland for the gold medal.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>His photograph — which showed players holding their sticks in the air and reveling on the ice — ran on the cover of Sports Illustrated, without any explanatory headline or caption, a rarity in the magazine’s history.</p><p>“I think that’s one of the pictures that people remember that I’ve taken,” Mr. <a href="https://dartmouthsports.com/news/2007/11/6/1305347.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kluetmeier told the sports website of Dartmouth College,</a> his alma mater, in 2007. “It’s the moment that is compelling.”</p><p>By the time he arrived in Beijing for the 2008 Summer Games, Mr. Kluetmeier had established himself as an expert in underwater photography. That was an outgrowth of his curiosity about how far he could take photography technologically and his early training as an engineer.</p><p>He and his longtime assistant, <a href="https://jeffkavanaugh.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jeff Kavanaugh</a>, designed and built a tethered underwater camera system that allowed images to download directly to a computer. That system conclusively showed Phelps touching the wall a hundredth of a second ahead of<span>  </span>Milorad Cavic of Serbia in the 100-meter butterfly final. It was the seventh of eight gold medals Phelps would win in China.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“The image of four sets of fingertips bent backward against the touch pads prompted a Serbian protest, instantly becoming an aquatic Zapruder film,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/01/sports/olympics/how-swimming-photographers-make-their-underwater-moment.html" title="">Andrew Das wrote in The New York Times in 2012</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/17/obituaries/17kluetmeier-phelps/17kluetmeier-phelps-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/17/obituaries/17kluetmeier-phelps/17kluetmeier-phelps-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/17/obituaries/17kluetmeier-phelps/17kluetmeier-phelps-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="An underwater view of two competing swimmers, arms extended and fingers touching the wall." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/17/obituaries/17kluetmeier-phelps/17kluetmeier-phelps-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/17/obituaries/17kluetmeier-phelps/17kluetmeier-phelps-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/17/obituaries/17kluetmeier-phelps/17kluetmeier-phelps-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/17/obituaries/17kluetmeier-phelps/17kluetmeier-phelps-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/ad0dba13-4307-55cf-9d0e-49c6b09dc77d" decoding="async" width="600" height="399"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Mr. Kluetmeier used a tethered underwater camera system to show conclusively that Michael Phelps, left, beat Milorad Cavic of Serbia by a hundredth of a second in the 100-meter butterfly final.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Heinz Kluetmeier/Sports Illustrated</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Kluetmeier first used an underwater camera, surreptitiously, at the 1991 world swimming championships in Perth, Australia, and then officially at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games.
