Its plans stalled by vociferous opposition, the company left the properties to crumble.</p></div></div><div><p>The project has been supported by the United States and the European Union, which is in desperate need of lithium to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/climate/europe-election-climate.html" title="">meet its climate goals</a>. But it has generated a wave of public fury in Serbia, where fears that the mine will poison the air and water have set off huge street protests against President Aleksandar Vucic.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>One of the homes purchased by Rio Tinto on land where it wants to mine lithium.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrej Isakovic/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Europe has plenty of lithium and more than 20 mining projects for the mineral at various stages of development. But none have started producing battery-grade lithium. The giant project in Serbia was aimed at filling that hole.</p><p>“There is no green transition in Europe without this lithium,” said Chad Blewitt, the head of Rio Tinto’s Serbian operations, adding that the company planned to invest more than $2.55 billion in the project.</p><p>The Serbian government gave preliminary approval in 2019, but, worried about losing votes during protests against Rio Tinto before a 2022 election, canceled it.</p><p>Under pressure from the European Union, which Serbia aspires to join, the government changed its mind in July, allowing Rio Tinto to revive the project. The British-Australian multinational says it has already invested nearly $600 million to buy land, dig 500 exploratory holes, commission studies and make donations to the local soccer club and other entities.</p></div></div><div><p>Serbia’s mining minister, Dubravka Djedovic Handanovic, said mining probably would not start for another two years, but once it did, lithium from the Jadar Valley would allow Serbia to manufacture batteries and electric cars, providing about 20,000 jobs.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Serbians took to the streets this month in Belgrade to protest Rio Tinto’s plans to develop a lithium mine.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fedja Grulovic/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>A <a href="https://hcss.nl/report/lithium-supply-security-europe-battery-industry/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report by The Hague Center for Strategic Studies</a> estimates that if it is to reach its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, Europe will need 60 times more lithium by that year than what it imported in 2020 from China and elsewhere.</p><p>Michael Schmidt, a lithium expert at Germany’s Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources, said Europe might be able to reach its targets without supplies from Serbia. But, he said, “the Serbian project is one of the largest, and that is why it is so significant.” He added, “We need each and every project to reach targets.”</p><p>The success of the projects ultimately depends on the price for lithium on the global market and whether companies like Rio Tinto can recoup their investments. The price has <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/lithium" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">collapsed over the past 18 months</a> as Chinese demand has slackened and its output soared.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The proposed mine in Serbia has not only provoked fury among farmers, environmental activists and ordinary citizens, it also has become a proxy battleground in the West’s efforts to extract the country from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/world/europe/xi-jinping-china-serbia-visit.html" title="">orbits of Russia, its traditional ally, and China</a>.</p><p>Geoffrey R.

Mr. Vucic, however, has said Moscow told him that the West is orchestrating the protests because it wants to topple him.</p><p>“Unfortunately, it has become a political fight, a big political battle,” said the mining minister, Ms. Djedovic Handanovic.</p></div></div><div><p>Among those taking part in recent nationwide demonstrations against Rio Tinto have been leaders of People’s Patrol, an ultranationalist group aligned with Moscow. Social media accounts known for spreading Russian disinformation have been active in promoting horror stories about the planned lithium mine.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An employee of Rio Tinto showing where the mining company conducted research in the Jadar Valley area.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vladimir Zivojinovic for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A pole showing where an exploratory hole was dug by Rio Tinto.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vladimir Zivojinovic for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Rio Tinto geologist showing a sample of Jadarite, a mineral containing lithium.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vladimir Zivojinovic for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p>But leftists and middle-of-the-road pro-Europeans have also joined the protests, chanting opposition to a project that has become a lightning rod for diverse grievances against the government.</p><p>“He sold out Kosovo but is not going to take away our clean water,” read a sign denouncing Mr. Vucic that was held by Angela Rojovic, 25, at a recent protest in Belgrade, the capital. She said the president had not done enough to defend the interests of Serbs living in mainly ethnic Albanian Kosovo.</p></div></div><div><div><p>And she said Mr. Vucic was sacrificing Serbia’s environment to serve Europe’s climate goals. “I don’t need green cars,” she said. “I need green apples and green grass.”</p><p>In Gornje Nedeljice, a Jadar Valley village that sits atop Europe’s biggest known deposit of high-grade lithium, the project has alienated Mr. Vucic’s previously stalwart rural base.</p><p>Dragan Karajcic, the district head for a cluster of small settlements around the proposed mine, said he was a member of Mr. Vucic’s governing party but still joined a local protest group hostile to Rio Tinto and the government.</p><p>“We are not trying to bring down the government,” he said. “The government is doing that itself.”</p><p>Goran Tomic, a native of Gornje Nedeljice who now lives mostly in Germany, said he understood the need to combat climate change by moving away from gasoline-powered cars, but he was still appalled that his older brother had agreed to sell his house and land to Rio Tinto.</p><p>“He allowed himself to betray himself for money, and in doing that he betrayed us all,” Mr. Tomic said, sitting on his front stoop with his mother, who was also angry but proud that two of her three sons refused to sell to Rio Tinto.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Goran Tomic and his mother, Milija, in front of his house in Gornje Nedeljice, Serbia. “He allowed himself to betray himself for money, and in doing that, he betrayed us all,” Mr. Tomic said of his older brother, who sold his own home.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vladimir Zivojinovic for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Its assurances over safety undermined by past <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/11/business/rio-tinto-indigenous-sites.html" title="">misbehavior</a>, Rio Tinto has tried to counter what it dismisses as lies and disinformation spread on social media by recently disclosing <a href="https://riotinto.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/spuzs/SPUZS%20Podzemni%20rudnik.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">preliminary findings of an environmental impact assessment</a>.
