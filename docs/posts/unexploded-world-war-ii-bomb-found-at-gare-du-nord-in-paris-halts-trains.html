Authorities halted all train traffic at the station after the discovery, causing disruptions that rippled across the English Channel.</p><p>“This was not a trivial operation,” Philippe Tabarot, France’s transportation minister, told reporters in Paris after the bomb was defused, adding that more than 300 police officers had been deployed to clear and secure a broad perimeter around the device, which weighed more than 1,000 pounds.</p><p>The bulky, cylindrical, rock-encrusted bomb was discovered around 3:30 a.m. about a mile and a half from the Gare du Nord, France’s national railway company said in a statement. Workers were landscaping at a bridge renovation site when an earth-moving machine revealed the bomb, which had been buried about six and a half feet underground.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>It is about three feet long and includes more than 400 pounds of explosive material, the company said, adding <a href="https://www.sncf-voyageurs.com/fr/voyagez-avec-nous/horaires-et-itineraires/informations-trafic/gl/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a travel notice</a> that “extensive earthworks” were necessary to safely defuse it. The police <a href="https://x.com/prefpolice/status/1897961566043066589" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">also temporarily closed off</a> sections of a nearby road and a highway.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photo released by the Paris police showed the unexploded WWII-era bomb.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Traffic on high-speed and commuter railways was stopped for hours. All Eurostar trains that connect Paris to London, Brussels and Amsterdam were canceled for the day, stranding travelers at the Gare du Nord, which <a href="https://ressources.data.sncf.com/explore/dataset/frequentation-gares/table/?q=Paris&amp;disjunctive.nom_gare&amp;disjunctive.code_postal" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">served more than 226 million travelers</a> in 2023.</p><p>Across the English Channel at London St. Pancras International Station, crowds of bewildered Eurostar passengers were met with a closed barrier. One of them, Katie Jones, was planning to celebrate her 40th birthday at Disneyland Paris. Her plans for an earlier trip to Paris in 2020 had fallen victim to the Covid-19 pandemic that sent much of the world into lockdown.</p><p>“I’m scared of flying, and that’s why we chose the Eurostar,” said Ms. Jones, who sobbed against a pillar as she called friends to relay the news. “The irony.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Eurostar said in a statement that it expected normal traffic on Saturday and that customers whose trains were canceled could exchange their ticket for free or claim a refund.</p><p>It is not uncommon in Europe for construction workers to come across unexploded ordnance from the conflicts that tore the continent apart during the 20th century, and the French railway company said that the area in which the latest bomb was found was “well known for its World War II remains.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers securing the area near where the unexploded bomb was found in Saint Denis, a Paris suburb.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Benoit Tessier/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Last month, more than 175 practice bombs that had been used for training during World War II <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/world/europe/wwii-bombs-playground-england.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">were found under a children’s playground</a> in northern England. In 2018, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/world/europe/berlin-evacuate-bomb-world-war-2.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">thousands of people were evacuated in Berlin</a> after an 1,100-pound bomb from the same era was uncovered.</p><p>“It doesn’t happen every day, but it happens,” said Fabien Villedieu, a leader of Sud-Rail, a union of national railway workers. He noted that the unexploded device was found about 600 feet from a busy express road that circles Paris.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“It’s in the middle of an urban zone,” Mr. Villedieu said.</p><p>The local authorities in Saint-Denis <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VilleSaintDenis/?locale=fr_FR" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> that nearby houses with windows overlooking the area had been ordered to evacuate during the bomb-clearing process.

Clara Thompson, 52, who is scheduled to run the Paris Half Marathon on Sunday, quickly booked a flight for Friday evening amid the chaos. “It’s an inconvenience, but I get it,” she said. “They found a bomb and they can’t do anything about it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But Allison and Jon Heine, who had just arrived on a red-eye flight from Houston, suddenly had three inconsolable children — ages 7, 9 and 13 — on their hands. Their vacation in Paris had been months in the planning.</p><p>“It’s not looking good,” Ms. Heine said. “There aren’t any flights. We heard there might be a bus, but it’s eight hours.”</p><p>“They’re super disappointed,” she said, pointing to her children. “Tons of tears.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lynsey Chutel is a Times reporter based in London who covers breaking news in Africa, the Middle East and Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lynsey-chutel">More about Lynsey Chutel</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
