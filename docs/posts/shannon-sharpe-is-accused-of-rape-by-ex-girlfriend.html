She says in the lawsuit that Mr. Sharpe, 56, raped her in her apartment in October and January.</p><p>The lawsuit says that, during the encounters, Mr. Sharpe forced himself upon the woman as she sobbed and begged for him to stop.</p><p>Lanny J. Davis, a lawyer representing Mr. Sharpe, denied all the accusations in a statement on social media, calling the lawsuit “a blatant and cynical attempt to shake down Mr. Sharpe for millions of dollars.” The lawyer also released graphic messages that he said were texts between Mr. Sharpe and the woman that showed a “consensual, adult relationship that included role-playing, sexual language, and fantasy scenarios explicitly requested” by the woman, whom he named.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The lawsuit was filed by Tony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer who has drawn attention for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-hotline-tony-buzbee-lawsuits.html" title="">filing more than three dozen lawsuits against Sean Combs</a> that accuse the music mogul of sexual misconduct. One of the suits also accused the rapper Jay-Z of rape, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/arts/music/jay-z-lawsuit-dismissed.html" title="">that case was withdrawn</a> after some of the details in the accuser’s account unraveled, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/arts/music/jay-z-rape-accuser-lawsuit.html" title="">starting a contentious legal battle</a> between Mr. Buzbee and Jay-Z.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/shannonsharpe/status/1914718565091197342?s=46&amp;t=4KJ1pd6x0KUz8sjVNS4aOg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a video posted on social media</a> on Tuesday, Mr. Sharpe said: “This is a shakedown. I’m going to be open, transparent and defend myself because this isn’t right. This is all being orchestrated by Tony Buzbee.”</p><p>In recent months, Mr. Buzbee has also filed sexual assault lawsuits against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/europe/andrew-tate-sexual-assault-lawsuit.html" title="">the online influencer Andrew Tate</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/realestate/tal-oren-alexander-brothers-lawsuits-sexual-assault.html" title="">the Alexander brothers</a>, two of whom were once top real estate brokers. In 2021, he was the lawyer for about two dozen women who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/deshaun-watson-sexual-assault-lawsuit.html" title="">accused the N.F.L. quarterback Deshaun Watson</a> of sexually harassing or assaulting them during massage appointments. Most of the lawsuits against Mr. Watson were settled.</p><p>In a statement about the accusations against Mr. Sharpe, Mr. Buzbee said, “I look forward to presenting the evidence in this case through the judicial process, where the truth matters more than a sports icon’s desperate public spin.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Sharpe is a three-time Super Bowl champion and a Pro Football Hall of Fame tight end who has become a media personality since his retirement after the 2003 season. His interview-based podcast “Club Shay Shay” grew in popularity after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oRRZiRQxTs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a January 2024 episode with the comedian Katt Williams</a>. Mr. Sharpe also appears on ESPN’s morning debate show “First Take.”</p><p>Julia Jacobs<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>April 22, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of Shannon Sharpe’s lawyer.
