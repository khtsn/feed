John Sauer; the New Jersey solicitor general; and a lawyer arguing on behalf of immigrant advocacy groups and individuals — is expected to concern the legality of injunctions, and whether a single federal judge can issue an order temporarily freezing a policy for the entire country.</p><p>Nationwide injunctions have been a contentious subject for years. The tool has been used under both Democratic and Republican administrations.</p><p>Although the Supreme Court has yet to issue a ruling that squarely addresses nationwide injunctions, some of the conservative justices have expressed skepticism that federal courts can block policies for the entire country.</p><p>Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, in an opinion in 2020, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19a785_j4ek.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticized injunctions</a> of “‘nationwide,’ ‘universal’ or ‘cosmic’ scope,” writing that such “patently unworkable” rulings were “sowing chaos.”</p><p>In a dissent in an emergency application in March, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/trump-judges.html" title="">criticized “the unchecked power”</a> of a district judge who had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/usaid-foreign-aid-freeze-release-deadline.html" title="">ordered the State Department to release roughly $2 billion</a> to contractors for the U.S. Agency for International Development.

Kavanaugh joined him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A884/354867/20250407120537009_24A884_24A885_24A886_Amica%20Brief.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">friend-of-the-court brief</a>, Mila Sohoni, a law professor at Stanford who has published law review articles arguing that such injunctions are constitutional, argued that nationwide injunctions were the best way to keep the status quo in place while lower court challenges proceed, preventing a patchwork of policies.</p><p>Opponents say these injunctions give far too much power to a single judge and improperly thwart national policies. The West Virginia attorney general’s office, in a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A884/357632/20250429112810764_Trump%20v%20CASA%20Amicus.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">friend-of-the-court brief, argued</a> that “broad injunctions like those seen here invite all sorts of mischief” and are an improper overreach of federal courts that comes “at the expense of state power.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Abbie VanSickle covers the United States Supreme Court for The Times.
