They became friends and ended up sharing an apartment in London, where Mr. Richler wrote “The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz” (1959), a novel about an amoral Jewish wheeler-dealer in Montreal who will do whatever he can to rise from poverty to wealth. Mr. Kotcheff vowed to Mr. Richler that one day he would direct a movie version of it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>And he did.

He then escapes to the woods with a posse in pursuit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sylvester Stallone in Mr. Kotcheff’s “First Blood” (1982), the first film in which Mr. Stallone played the troubled Vietnam War veteran Rambo.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Orion, via Everett Collection</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>After filming the ending, in which Rambo killed himself, Mr. Stallone warned Mr. Kotcheff that the scene would anger audiences after the physical ordeal that Rambo had endured.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><a href="https://ew.com/movies/2017/04/07/first-blood-rambo-dead-ending-kirk-douglas/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In an interview with Entertainment Weekly</a> in 2017, Mr. Kotcheff recalled Mr. Stallone saying to him, “All this and now we’re gonna kill him?”</p><p>Attendees at a test screening uniformly reported that they loved the film but hated the ending. Mr. Kotcheff recalled that one audience member said aloud, “If the director of this film is in this movie house, let’s string him up from the nearest lamppost.”</p><p>By then, though, Mr. Kotcheff had filmed an alternative ending — the one he ultimately used — in which Rambo walks out of a police station, wounded but alive. The movie was an immediate hit, grossing more than $125 million (about $407 million in current dollars).</p><p>The movie’s success spawned four sequels, none of which Mr. Kotcheff directed. He refused to direct the first, “Rambo: First Blood Part II” (1985), because of the violence that the character unleashes.</p><p>“I read the script, and I said, ‘In the first film he doesn’t kill anybody,’” <a href="https://filmmakermagazine.com/98769-ted-kotcheff-making-first-blood-changing-rambos-suicide-mission-and-not-working-with-kirk-douglas/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he told Filmmaker magazine in 2016</a>. “In this film he kills 74 people.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From left, Jonathan Silverman, Terry Kiser (as a corpse) and Andrew McCarthy in “Weekend at Bernie’s” (1989).

His father, Theodore, a Bulgarian immigrant, was a restaurateur. His mother, Diana (Christoff) Kotcheff, who was an ethnic Macedonian from Bulgaria, managed the home.</p><p>Both his parents performed as members of a left-wing theater club that staged plays in a Bulgarian-Macedonian hall. Watching his parents, aunts and uncles act onstage nurtured Ted’s love of theater; at age 5, he played a village child in one of the troupe’s plays, “The Macedonian Blood Wedding.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kotcheff on the set of his made-for-TV movie “The Desperate Hours” in 1967.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Susan Wood/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>After graduating from the University of Toronto in 1952 with a bachelor’s degree in English literature, he worked as a stagehand at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for two years before moving up to become a writer of documentaries and director of live dramas. Seeking greater opportunities, he left for Britain, where he directed television plays, movies and stage productions.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Mr. Kotcheff was barred from the United States for 21 years. In 1953, he said, he was turned away by U.S. immigration officers in Vermont for having been a member of a left-wing book club, which he had joined as a teenager and remained with for seven months. In 1968, during an anti-apartheid charity event that Mr. Kotcheff directed at Royal Albert Hall in London, a member of the rock band the Nice burned the image of an American flag on cardboard.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Donald Pleasence, left, and Gary Bond in Mr. Kotcheff’s “Wake in Fright” (1971).

The films he made after that included “Fun With Dick and Jane” (1977), a comedy about a jobless middle-class couple (played by George Segal and Jane Fonda) who become armed robbers; “North Dallas Forty” (1979), a gritty comedy-drama about a professional football team starring Nick Nolte and Mac Davis; and “Uncommon Valor” (1983), the story of a retired Marine colonel (Gene Hackman) who organizes a rescue team to find American soldiers imprisoned nearly a decade after the Vietnam War.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kotcheff’s “North Dallas Forty” (1979) was a gritty comedy-drama about a professional football team.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paramount Pictures, via Everett Collection</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>In addition to his son Thomas — from his marriage to Laifun Chung, who also survives him — Mr. Kotcheff is survived by a daughter from that marriage, Alexandra Kotcheff; two sons, Aaron and Joshua, and a daughter, Katrina Kotcheff, from his marriage to the British actress Sylvia Kay, which ended in divorce; four grandchildren; and a brother, Tim.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>After directing several TV movies in the 1990s, Mr. Kotcheff had a major final act as an executive producer of “Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit,” from 1999 to 2012. He was in charge of casting the show, including its two leads, Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni, and supervised the directors.</p><p>He also directed seven episodes of the series, one of them focused almost entirely on Ms. Hargitay, who, as Detective Olivia Benson, keeps a little girl, who says she is a hostage, on the phone until the police can find her. Neal Baer, a former showrunner on the series, said the episode had its roots in “The Human Voice,” a one-character 1966 TV movie directed by Mr. Kotcheff starring Ingrid Bergman as a woman on the phone with the lover who is abandoning her. Ms. Hargitay won her only Primetime Emmy for the episode.</p><p>One project of Mr. Kotcheff’s that never came to fruition, despite many years of work, was one about King Boris III of Bulgaria.</p><p>“He would say, ‘I need money for King Boris!’” Mr. Baer recalled.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Richard Sandomir, an obituaries reporter, has been writing for The Times for more than three decades.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
