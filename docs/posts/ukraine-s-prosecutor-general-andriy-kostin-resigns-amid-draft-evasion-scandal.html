That is partly a result of corruption schemes in which potential conscripts bribe enlistment officers or medical workers at recruitment centers in exchange for fake documents exempting them from serving in the military.</p><p>Last year, Mr. Zelensky <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/11/world/europe/ukraine-fires-recruitment-chiefs.html" title="">dismissed all</a> of the country’s regional military recruitment chiefs following a major bribery scandal.</p><p>Corruption issues have eroded public confidence in Ukraine’s conscription system and the latest scandal, and accusations that it directly benefited top officials, is likely to deepen that distrust and complicate the army’s task to draft more people.</p><p>Recent outcries over mobilization tactics, including recruitment officers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/world/europe/ukraine-draft-concert-army.html" title="">corralling men at concerts</a>, have added to the discontent. Many soldiers have also voiced frustration with what they see as a deeply unfair system in which some can bribe their way out of service while those at the front cannot be discharged after years of exhausting combat. Last month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/world/europe/ukraine-troop-fatigue.html" title="">a soldier deserted</a> in what he said was an effort to publicize the issue.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Under martial law in Ukraine, men of ages 18 to 60 must remain in the country, report to their local recruitment offices and undergo medical screening for possible service. There are a handful of exemptions, including for being enrolled in a university, having a disability or having at least three children.</p><p>The most recent accusations of a draft-dodging scheme came with the <a href="https://dbr.gov.ua/news/dbr-zatrimalo-kerivnicyu-msek-z-hmelnichchini" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arrest</a> this month of the head of the Center for Medical and Social Expertise in the western region of Khmelnytsky.

The agency said it had dismantled criminal groups in at least four regions, uncovering schemes that generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit.</p><p>More than 4,000 disability certificates that were forged have been canceled, the agency added. Vasyl Malyuk, the head of the S.B.U., said in a <a href="https://ssu.gov.ua/novyny/za-materialamy-sbu-pidozru-vzhe-otrymaly-64-posadovtsia-msek-a-takozh-skasovano-ponad-4-tys-vysnovkiv-pro-invalidnist-vasyl-maliuk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> that abuses in medical commissions “have an extremely negative impact on mobilization processes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Many people voiced their shock about the latest scandal on social networks and comedians mocked medical commission officials in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DA1P1gMNBOU/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">videos</a> depicting them with piles of cash. Many Ukrainians see the mobilization process as favoring the wealthy or well-connected who have the means to avoid conscription.</p><p>Filling the army’s ranks has been a major concern for the Ukrainian authorities for more than a year, with officials saying last year that they needed to recruit up to half a million people to make up for battlefield losses and withstand another year of intense fighting.</p><p>The issue has taken on particular importance since the beginning of the year, as the Russian army has steadily gained ground in eastern Ukraine, in part by throwing large numbers of soldiers into bloody attacks, regardless of the losses.</p><p>The Ukrainian Parliament enacted a new conscription law that took effect in May, enabling the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/world/europe/ukraine-war-troops-russia-mobilization.html" title="">drafting of up to 30,000 individuals per month</a> during the summer, roughly matching the recruitment numbers of the Russian Army during the same period.</p><p>But Vasyl Rumak, a Ukrainian military official in charge of training, said during a <a href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-defense/3917939-over-20000-mobilized-soldiers-currently-undergoing-training-in-ukraine.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news conference</a> last week that this number had dropped to 20,000 this month because of issues in the conscription process.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
