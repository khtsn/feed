data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>As President Trump flexes his power over universities, law firms, media companies and more, some of the country’s most powerful institutions have faced a choice, to cut a deal with the White House or fight back.</p><p>In recent weeks, an increasing number are choosing to do battle with the president.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/politics/harvard-trump.html" title="">Harvard University</a> refused this week to cave to what its president called “assertions of power, unmoored from the law.” More than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/law-firms-perkins-coie-trump.html" title="">500 law firms</a> have thrown their support behind some of their embattled peers as Mr. Trump seeks retribution against lawyers who represented or helped his political foes. The country’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/trump-ap-oval-office-access.html" title="">oldest news wire</a> fought Mr. Trump in court after it was banned from the Oval Office.</p><p>The new face of resistance is not like the one of Mr. Trump’s first term, when officials who opposed his agenda from inside the government tried to establish guardrails to prevent some of the president’s more radical ideas.</p><p>Now the fight is out in the open. The guardrails are gone, in large part because Mr. Trump demands loyalty from everyone around him. With almost no opposing voices inside the White House, the president’s campaign against the institutions of government, society and law have been more intense and have played out faster than they did during his first term.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And while Mr. Trump has succeeded in wrenching enormous concessions through threats, lawsuits and coercion — and he has shown no signs of stopping — there are hints of a shift in strategy among some of his targets.</p><p>Laurence H. Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard, said a buzz began building among the faculty as Mr. Trump turned his focus to the university in recent weeks.</p><p>“It was probably the main topic of conversation,” Mr. Tribe said. “When will the university finally stand up? When will the endowment, which is supposed to be there partly for extreme emergencies, be part of what Harvard looks to in order to basically reinforce its spine?”</p><p>The initial response by some organizations to Mr. Trump’s political assault was to try to appease the president. Several elite law firms <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/business/trump-law-firms-kirkland-ellis-latham-watkins.html" title="">decided to settle with the White House</a> in order to maintain their ability to do work with the government. Columbia University <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/nyregion/columbia-response-trump-demands.html" title="">relented in the face of the president’s threat</a> to cancel $400 million in federal support.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-policy-blitz.html" title="">“flood the zone” strategy</a> inside the White House has left many Democrats and others opposed to Mr. Trump’s policies resigned to the fact that they control few centers of power with which to fight back.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Harvard’s decision to reject the Trump administration’s demands on hiring, admissions and curriculum could embolden other universities across the country to push back. The erstwhile leader of the Democratic Party, <a href="https://x.com/BarackObama/status/1911980834048954551" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">former President Barack Obama</a>, called on other institutions to “follow suit” after Harvard.</p><p>There were already some rumblings of resistance in recent weeks, with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/anti-trump-protests-hands-off.html" title="">mass “Hands Off” protests in cities across the country</a>. Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/bernie-sanders-aoc-trump-democrats.html" title="">have also drawn significant crowds</a> on their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour.</p><p>“Those rallies have built momentum by just showing that there are lots of people who don’t like what he is doing,” said Nikolas Bowie, a Harvard law professor who has urged the university’s administration to resist the demands. “Even though Trump is kind of picking people and individuals and institutions off one by one, for everyone to just see, ‘Oh, we all think what’s happening is wrong,’ is important.”</p><p>Leah Greenberg, a founder of the progressive group Indivisible, which helped organize the Hands Off rallies, said momentum had been building for months as outrage grew, from activists in the streets to the halls of elite institutions.</p><p>Harvard’s stance is “crucial and important,” Ms. Greenberg said. “I say that as someone who doesn’t spend a ton of time praising Harvard,” she added. “There was a sense that American society is folding to Trump’s will. Saying, ‘Oh, hell no, we aren’t,’ it’s helpful for a lot of people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At Harvard, hundreds, including Mr. Bowie, <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/4/13/aaup-city-council-anti-trump-rally/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rallied to call on the school</a> to stand up to the Trump administration’s demands, while hundreds of faculty members <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/3/27/faculty-letter-condemn-attacks/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">signed a letter</a> urging Harvard to condemn Mr. Trump’s attempt to remake higher education.</p><p>At Yale, nearly 1,000 faculty members <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yalefacultyletter2025/home" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">signed a letter</a> calling on their leaders to resist Mr. Trump’s demands. And the president of M.I.T. <a href="https://orgchart.mit.edu/letters/further-responses-federal-actions" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spoke out against</a> the Trump administration’s treatment of its international students.</p><p>The Trump administration has argued that its goal in going after elite universities is to crack down on antisemitism on college campuses. But <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/research-funding/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2025/04/Letter-Sent-to-Harvard-2025-04-11.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its demands are much broader</a>, including audits of staff members to prevent Harvard from considering racial diversity in hiring decisions and audits of the student body’s ideological views.</p><p>The administration also demanded that the university reduce the “power” on campus held by certain students, faculty members and administrators.</p><p>Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said on Tuesday that Harvard “has not taken the president or the administration’s demands seriously.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Why are the American taxpayers subsidizing a university that has billions of dollars in the bank already?” she asked. “And we certainly should not be funding a place where such grave antisemitism exists.”</p><p>Refusing the demands came with a cost. Within hours of Harvard’s decision, federal officials said they would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/harvard-trump-reject-demands.html" title="">freeze $2.2 billion</a> in multiyear grants to the university, along with a $60 million contract.</p><p>And then on Tuesday, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-harvard-tax-status.html" title="">threatened Harvard’s tax-exempt status</a>, even <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7217" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">though federal law</a> prohibits the president from “directly or indirectly” telling the I.R.S. to conduct specific tax investigations.</p><p>Much of federal funding for universities is for student aid and research. Harvard revamped its website to emphasize the importance of its research, highlighting its work aiding stroke survivors, treating sickle cell disease and combating chronic absenteeism in schools.</p><p>Mr. Tribe said he had heard colleagues worry about how the funding cuts could affect their research, but not as much as they were concerned about the larger principle at stake.</p><p>“I know people at the medical school and elsewhere who are cheering what Harvard did,” Mr. Tribe said, “although they are at the same time grieving for the likelihood that their clinics will end up being closed and that the lifesaving research they’re doing will either be discontinued or put on indefinite hold.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Luke Broadwater covers the White House for The Times.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>13</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Institutions Targeted by Trump Face a Choice: Cut a Deal or Resist<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/harvard-university">Harvard University</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Showdown with Courts: </strong>By refusing to return a deported migrant, President Trump is flirting with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-defy-courts.html">a lawless defiance of court orders</a>, scholars say.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iran Nuclear Talks</strong><strong>: </strong>As the administration grapples with how to stop Iran’s nuclear program, it has so far left a trail of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-negotations.html">mixed messages, conflicting signals and blustering threats</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Changing Briefing Room: </strong>For decades, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/15/us/trump-white-house-briefing-room-new-media.html">the seating chart in the White House press briefing room has been controlled</a> by an independent organization.
