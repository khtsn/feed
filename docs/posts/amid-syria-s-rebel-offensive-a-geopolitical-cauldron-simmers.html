Russian planes have bombed rebel positions, while on the ground, Iranian-backed militias like the Lebanon-based Hezbollah have battled rebel fighters in support of the Syrian government.</p><p>Turkey and the United States also have troops present in Syria in areas not controlled by the government where they support different rebel groups — Turkey in the northwestern region, and the United States in the northeast.</p><p>In the offensive that began last week, various Syrian rebel groups have united under the leadership of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-hts-who-what.html" title="">Hayat Tahrir al-Sham</a>, a former affiliate of the terrorist group Al Qaeda.

And it may disrupt the gradual trend toward acceptance internationally of Mr. al-Assad’s remaining as leader of Syria and the resumption of diplomatic relations with Syria <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/17/world/middleeast/syria-assad-arab-league-summit.html?searchResultPosition=20" title="">among Arab states</a> and some European nations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Both Russia and Iran have declared their support for Mr. al-Assad, but beyond <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/syria-aleppo-assad.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">several Russian airstrikes</a> on the cities of Idlib and Aleppo, which are both in rebel hands, analysts are questioning how much assistance they will be able to deliver in the immediate term.</p><p>Arab states have expressed concern about Syria’s sovereignty being respected, which analysts said was a diplomatic way of criticizing Turkey’s continuing role in backing rebel groups for its own interests.</p><p>“Concern in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iraq &amp; Israel over the potential collapse of the Assad regime &amp; Turkish expansion in Syria,” Hassan I.

It also potentially paves the way for new offensive operations, the report said.</p><p>“Russia faces a genuine predicament due to the growing challenges of adapting to the evolving battlefield realities, further complicating its ability to provide effective support to the regime,” the center said.</p><p>Turkey and the United States both support armed groups in Syria that have fought against groups backed by Russia and Iran.</p><p>Turkey supports the Syrian National Army, which is part of the rebel force fighting in Aleppo. It has long been focused on expanding a buffer zone along its border with Syria to guard against the activities of Kurdish militants based in the region that it sees as a threat. It also wants to create an area where it can resettle some of the three million refugees who have fled Syria and are living in Turkey.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The American forces in Syria work with the Kurds, and have armed and equipped a predominantly Kurdish militia, the Syrian Democratic Forces, to fight against the Islamic State, the extremist group that is also active in the region. Both Turkish and American forces have clashed with Russian forces on occasion in Syria.</p><p>Despite their dispute over American support for the Kurdish force, Turkey and the United States have managed to avoid direct clashes between their operations in Syria. The Syrian forces allied to each of them negotiated for the Kurdish troops to withdraw from positions without a fight, Mr. Moustafa said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators outside the Turkish Embassy in Tehran on Monday protesting against Turkey’s support for rebels in Syria.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Moustafa said there had been and continued to be coordination between the rebels and Ukraine on such issues as countering Russian misinformation and providing medical assistance.</p><p>“Two nations are fighting for their country to be free of tyranny and outside occupation,” he said. “It’s natural for them to coordinate.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Ukrainian officials have not commented on the Syrian offensive, but Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, has repeatedly said his forces would seek to attack Russian forces anywhere in the world.</p><p>Syrians watching events from outside the country describe this offensive, including the negotiated withdrawals, as distinct from previous periods of fighting. Few believe the government can retake lost territory quickly because of low morale in the army and in government-controlled parts of the country.</p><p>In those areas, many people, including government officials, have been reduced to poverty, and that is one of the reasons for the swift collapse of the government forces, analysts say.</p><p>Ruhullah Khapalwak<!-- --> and Saad Alnassife contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
