    <h1>The Final Push for Ukraine?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The war in Ukraine is escalating quickly and unpredictably. Ukraine is now using U.S.-made missiles to strike inside Russia, with President Biden’s permission. Russia has raised the threat of nuclear weapons. It has also sacrificed thousands of troops to take more territory in eastern Ukraine, achieving <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/31/world/europe/russia-gains-ukraine-maps.html" title="">its largest gains in more than two years</a>.</p><p>At the same time, an end to the war seems closer than ever. Donald Trump has promised to negotiate a truce quickly once he takes office in January. Given how much Ukraine depends on the United States, Trump could force Ukraine to accept a deal.</p><p>These things — the recent escalations and a potential end to the war — are related. As Russia and Ukraine prepare for a potential peace deal, they are working to improve their negotiating positions. That reality has kicked off a dangerous and urgent phase of the war, although one that could last only a few months.</p><p>Today’s newsletter will explain the recent events and what could come next.</p><h2 id="link-50a2e3d6">Ratcheting up</h2><p>The recent events in Ukraine can be summarized as a series of escalations. After Ukraine lost territory on its eastern front, it opened a northern front this past summer in the Russian region of Kursk. It grabbed Russian territory for the first time in the war, and has managed to hold the land. Russia then recruited more than 10,000 soldiers from North Korea to try to reclaim the area.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Washington saw North Korea’s involvement as a big deal. After all, Russia has warned the West against sending any of its own troops in Ukraine’s defense. Yet Russia turned around and got outside help.</p><p>In response, the United States has allowed Ukraine to fire American-made long-range missiles into Russian territory. Ukraine did so for the first time yesterday, hitting an ammunition depot.</p><p>The specific missiles, known as ATACMS, do not have the range to hit Moscow. “U.S. officials do not want to see ATACMS flying at the Kremlin,” said my colleague Julian Barnes, who covers international security. “That’s not what this is about.” Instead, Ukraine can use the missiles to weaken Russian advances and hold territory in Kursk and elsewhere.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Why are U.S. officials so cautious about how Ukraine uses these weapons? Russia’s actions yesterday offer an explanation. It declared the right to respond with a nuclear weapon to an attack by a nonnuclear nation (Ukraine, presumably) that’s supported by a nuclear-armed country (the United States). Since the beginning of the war, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has used the threat of nukes to deter Western involvement. To some extent, the threat has worked. It previously kept Americans from supplying ATACMS and fighter jets, for instance.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Putin is not actually closer to using nukes, American officials say. But the consequences of a nuclear conflict are so large — potentially world-ending — that even a tiny or slightly growing risk is alarming.</p><h2 id="link-3b52cf2a">Seeking the best deal</h2><p>There’s another factor behind Biden’s decision to let Ukraine strike inside Russia: the coming Trump administration.</p><p>Trump has indicated that he will not offer the same level of military support to Ukraine that Biden has. He wants to end the war as soon as possible. He will likely try to force both sides to negotiate some sort of truce, even if Ukraine doesn’t regain its territory in the process.</p><p>That means Ukraine is running out of time to improve its negotiating position. If it can hold on to parts of Kursk, maybe it can trade the area for more of its eastern territory held by Russia. In other words, Ukraine’s strength at the bargaining table depends on fending off Russian and North Korean troops in the coming months.</p><p>Russia is trying to improve its own hand, too. It has pushed farther into eastern Ukraine despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/world/europe/russia-troops-losses-ukraine.html" title="">staggering losses</a>. (As of last month, the war had left 600,000 to 700,000 Russian troops dead or wounded, Western officials estimate.) Russia continues its brutal campaign knowing that every inch of land it claims now could be kept for good.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>All of this adds up to a bit of a paradox: Peace may be around the corner, but the fighting could get bloodier as both sides try to position themselves for a more favorable deal.</p><h2 id="link-3c1c6048">For more</h2><ul><li><p>The U.S. has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/world/europe/us-embassy-ukraine-warning.html" title="">closed its embassy in Kyiv</a>, Ukraine’s capital, and told employees to shelter in place, warning that Russia was planning a significant air attack.</p></li><li><p>Biden authorized the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/11/19/biden-landmines-ukraine-russia/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">provision of some land mines to Ukraine</a>, The Washington Post reports.
