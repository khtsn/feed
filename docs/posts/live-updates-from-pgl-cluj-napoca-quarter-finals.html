                        <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/21/zonic" data-tooltip-id="uid757543153">Danny <span>&#34;⁠zonic⁠&#34;</span> Sørensen</a> stopped for a quick chat with HLTV following <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/11283/falcons" data-tooltip-id="uid1109993300">Falcons</a>&#39; elimination from PGL Cluj-Napoca at the hands of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/12467/parivision" data-tooltip-id="uid557484063">PARIVISION</a>, emphasising his team&#39;s tendency to throw away favourable rounds.</p>
                        <p><strong>On what went wrong:</strong> I think obviously on Dust2... we knew it was a good map for them but, in my opinion, I felt that we had it in our hands, and we just keep fucking up these rounds we are not supposed to.</p>
                        <p>It&#39;s getting a bit tiring because we work so much on it. I know that it&#39;s probably not what all people are thinking at home, but I can tell you that this is one of the main topics every time we are practicing, going through these rounds.</p>
                        <p>We do extremely well some part of the tournament, even some part of this game, I felt on Mirage T side especially we were never overextending and really trying to play as a team. It&#39;s costly, at this level you will lose games just because of that.</p>
                        <p><strong>On if he was talking about 1v3 on Dust2:</strong> Also I think the two on one. I think there were a couple of episodes where we had to play better together, sometimes we even have to not take a fight, and it&#39;s frustrating right now.</p>
                        <p><strong>On losing to Glocks on Ancient:</strong> We know we have an extremely good CT side on Ancient, but if you lose that second round it&#39;s going to be tough. Not just because you lose that round and get reset, but also because of the mental part. It&#39;s super frustrating and yeah, back to the drawing board.</p>
