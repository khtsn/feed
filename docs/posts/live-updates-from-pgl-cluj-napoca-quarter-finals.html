                        <p><strong>On NAVI win:</strong> &#34;They are a really good team and they always keep you on the edge. We had a really bad T side on Ancient, but outside of that, all the other halves were pretty good.&#34;</p>
                        <p><strong>On showing a bit more attitude against the crowd:</strong> &#34;We are not one of the teams who interact with the crowd that much, it&#39;s true. I want to do it, but I think sometimes in games it&#39;s hard, you&#39;re really focused on the game. But I think when I see other people do it, it&#39;s cool, it&#39;s nice for the show. torzsi&#39;s doing it sometimes, so trying to enjoy the moment and adapt into it, but it&#39;s not something we talked about or anything.&#34;</p>
                        <p><strong>On PARIVISION rematch tomorrow:</strong> &#34;They have a really unique style. It can be really annoying to play against, especially when you lose. I think we are good at understanding what to do and how to play against them, we showed it in the group stage. But still, they are a strong team, they just beat Falcons and they are playing great CS. We were confident against NAVI and we lost T Ancient like this, so you can&#39;t underestimate anyone.&#34;</p>
                        <p><strong>On why PARIVISION can be annoying:</strong> &#34;Sometimes they can be really passive, sometimes they can be really aggressive, and then you have Jame, who is suddenly lurking with the AWP when you don&#39;t expect it. They can play on the last five seconds of the round. It&#39;s not as common. They&#39;re unique, yeah.&#34;</p>
