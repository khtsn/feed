A 2023 report by the National Restaurant Association showed that they made up <a href="https://restaurant.org/education-and-resources/resource-library/alcohol-beverage-services-overflowing-with-potential-to-draw-customers-drive-sales/#:~:text=Data%20analysis%20finds%20that%20among,choose%20one%20restaurant%20over%20another." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 21 percent of all sales</a> at full-service restaurants. At some fine-dining establishments, the number was closer to 30 percent.</p><p>It’s too soon to know if the report, coming after years of warnings about the health hazards of drinking and the rising use of GLP-1 drugs that can <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/08/28/1194526119/ozempic-wegovy-drinking-alcohol-cravings-semaglutide" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reduce the desire to drink,</a> will slow alcohol sales at restaurants even more. But owners are bracing for that, and many have already turned to offering more nonalcoholic beverages.</p><p>“This news we’ve just gotten is probably going to affect things,” said <a href="https://www.htownrestaurantgroup.com/team-member/tracy-vaught/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tracy Vaught</a>, who owns five restaurants in Houston with her husband, the chef <a href="https://www.htownrestaurantgroup.com/team/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hugo Ortega</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Alcohol sales at her restaurants have been falling. In 2015, they produced 31.5 percent of the company’s income. Last year, that share slipped to 27.5 percent. “It doesn’t seem like much, but it really makes a difference,” she said.</p><p>Although alcohol generates far less revenue for restaurants than food, profit margins on drinks are much larger, and the financial risks for owners are fewer. Unlike a walk-in refrigerator filled with perishable food, the bar is stocked with inventory that doesn’t go bad. Labor costs at the bar are easier to manage, too.</p><p>At the Atlanta restaurant <a href="https://gunshowatl.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gunshow</a>, sales of alcoholic drinks account for about 30 percent of all revenue, but they provide about 80 percent of the profit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The same amount of thought and creativity goes into all the cocktails at Gunshow in Atlanta, whether they contain alcohol or not.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brandon Amato</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“Margins for food have decreased so significantly over the last four years that without a solid beverage program, restaurants can’t make it,” said <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/tinfoil-swans-podcast-s2-ep10-kevin-gillespie-and-the-restaurant-of-a-lifetime-8677997" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kevin Gillespie</a>, who owns Gunshow and the tasting menu restaurant <a href="https://nadairatl.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nàdair</a>. “But there are creative paths out of this.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Customers might not want alcohol, but many still want a cocktail. It’s a challenge to make sophisticated nonalcoholic drinks as appealing as their spirited equivalents, but done right they can be priced almost identically, Mr. Gillespie said.</p><p>Ryan Schmied, director of food and beverage at the <a href="https://amwaygrand.com/dining" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amway Grand Plaza Hotel</a> in Grand Rapids, Mich., took action a year ago, after noticing a dip in sales of alcoholic beverages, especially beer and wine.</p><p>Some changes were easy, like adding no- and low-alcoholic beer and wine, and expanding bottled-water offerings at six of the hotel’s eight bars and restaurants. He capitalized on customers’ growing preference for quality over quantity. For years, inexpensive wines by the glass were top sellers. “Now we are selling more and more $20 and $30 glasses,” he said, “and mind you, we are in Grand Rapids.”</p><p>But cocktails without liquor have made the biggest difference in bolstering his bottom line. The copa verde, with nonalcoholic spirits, a honeydew-almond cordial, pandan and Sanbitter, sells for $15 at the hotel’s Spanish restaurant <a href="https://amwaygrand.com/dining/mdrd" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MDRD</a> — the same price as most of the other specialty cocktails on the menu.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Restaurant owners say some customers are drinking less wine, but it’s better-quality and more expensive.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Colin Clark for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Drinks without alcohol now account for about 15 percent of all beverage sales at the restaurants and bars in the hotel. “It sounds like a small number, but 10 or 15 percent can make or break a place,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn, alcohol is essential to running a successful restaurant business, especially given recent increases in the cost of ingredients, rent, insurance and labor, said Chase Sinzer, an owner of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/dining/restaurant-review-claud-east-village.html" title="">Claud</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/11/dining/restaurant-review-penny-east-village.html" title="">Penny</a> in the East Village.</p><p>“If you can sell more booze than the other person, you have a greater chance of economic survival,” he said. “It’s a very scary world without it.”</p><p>It’s easier to plug holes in the budget by charging more for drinks. Customers have fixed ideas about what menu items should cost, but there’s more flexibility in what they’ll spend on cocktails, beer and wine.</p><p>“They’ll say, ‘I’m paying this much for a piece of chicken?’” he said. “When chicken costs 75 percent more than it used to and we can only raise the price 25 percent, you’d better sell some booze. No one spends more on chicken than the next table, but people make different choices about alcohol.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Not all restaurants are seeing a drop in alcohol sales. John Ragan, president of fine dining restaurants at <a href="https://www.ushg.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Union Square Hospitality Group</a> in New York City, said guests are looking for wines lower in alcohol, but aren’t noticeably drinking less.</p><p>In the 18 years he’s been on the job, he’s seen drinking trends come and go. When “60 Minutes” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/well/eat/red-wine-heart-health.html" title="">aired a segment in 1991</a> suggesting red wine was the reason the French had a low incidence of heart disease despite their high consumption of fat, sales of red wine jumped.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Restaurants are increasingly concocting nonalcoholic cocktails with complex ingredients, like the Cucumber Mule at Costera in New Orleans.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Courtesy of Costera</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The surgeon general’s report might stir some waves, Mr. Ragan said, but it’s unlikely to cause a seismic shift in drinking habits. “There might be some ebbs and flows, but I think whatever your favorite pairing is at the table I don’t perceive changing in a big way,” he said.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.twistedsoulatl.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twisted Soul Cookhouse &amp; Pour</a>s in Atlanta, more customers are “pre-gaming” with a drink or two at home, said creative director and owner, <a href="https://chefdeborahvantrece.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deborah VanTrece</a>. And more people are ordering nonalcoholic cocktails. But she and her team haven’t seen a drop in alcohol sales.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>That’s in part because customers are willing to spend $30 or more on specialty cocktails featuring expensive liquors like the hard-to-find SirDavis American Whisky, from Beyoncé.</p><p>But if the surgeon general’s warnings get traction and Gen Zers continue to drink less, income from alcohol could drop.</p><p>“For the most part, right now we feel steady,” she said, “but people will at some point generally jump on a bandwagon, so I’m not saying it’s not coming.”</p><p>Pete Wells contributed reporting.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>New York Times Cooking on Instagram</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/nytcooking" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>YouTube</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nytcooking?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>TikTok</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Pinterest</em></a><em>. </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking" title=""><em>Get regular updates from New York Times Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Kim Severson is an Atlanta-based reporter who covers the nation’s food culture and contributes to <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/ourcooks/kim-severson/my-recipes">NYT Cooking</a>.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kim-severson">More about Kim Severson</a></span></p></div></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/01/08/dining/drinks/restaurants-alcohol-surgeon-general-warning.html">266</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/01/08/dining/drinks/restaurants-alcohol-surgeon-general-warning.html">266</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Food and Dining</h2><h3>Keep tabs on dining trends, restaurant reviews and recipes.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p>Our reporters and editors traveled to nearly every state for our annual list of America’s best restaurants. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/dining/best-restaurants-america.html">These are our 50 favorite places for 2024</a>.</p></li><li><p>How will we eat in 2025? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/dining/food-eating-predictions-2025.html">Food forecasters see a year of offbeat choices</a>, including savory coffees, great convenience-store cuisine and sauces on everything.</p></li><li><p>In this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/24/dining/american-bakeries-golden-age.html">golden age of American bakeries</a>, virtuosic pastries and delightful breads are close at hand, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-bakeries-america.html">from coastal Maine to downtown Los Angeles</a>.</p></li><li><p>Why do celebrities all go to the same restaurants?
