    <h1>Kentucky Sheriff Accused of Fatally Shooting Judge Pleads Not Guilty</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A Kentucky sheriff charged with first-degree murder in the fatal shooting of a judge pleaded not guilty on Wednesday in a case that has shaken the small rural community of Letcher County.</p><p>Sheriff Shawn Stines, also known as Mickey, made his first court appearance as a defendant in the case at his virtual arraignment. He is accused of fatally shooting Judge Kevin Mullins last Thursday in his chambers in the Letcher County Courthouse in Whitesburg.</p><p>Law enforcement officials have not disclosed a motive. And the hearing before Chief Regional District Judge H. Rupert Wilhoit did not yield any clues.</p><p>During the 10-minute proceeding, Sheriff Stines appeared onscreen standing between <a href="https://dpa.ky.gov/kentucky-department-of-public-advocacy/findhelp/find-a-dpa-office/capital-trial-branches/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Josh Miller</a>, a public defender, and Danny Clark, the county jailer for Leslie County, where Mr. Stines is being held.</p></div></div>
