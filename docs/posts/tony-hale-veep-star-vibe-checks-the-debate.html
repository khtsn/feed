    <h1>Tony Hale, Veep Star, Vibe Checks the Debate</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the hours since Tim Walz and JD Vance squared off in the only vice-presidential debate of 2024, many journalists, pundits and citizens of the internet have come forth to challenge and fact-check the assertions lobbed by both candidates.</p><p>But here in Opinion Video, we aim to provide the kind of services you just won’t find anywhere else. Rather than solely focusing on the facts, we enlisted the comedic talents of the Gregory Brothers and the “Veep” star Tony Hale to check something of equal import: the vibes.</p></div></div>
