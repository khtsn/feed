It’s a thing that’s tangible but needs participation, like a watch that requires winding. Now imagine that person goes away, and you still have to tend the garden you planted with him, or sing the song you wrote together or walk through a house that is now fully characterized by its emptiness. Many people, I know, don’t have to imagine.</p><p>It’s strange math. The loss of a collaborator feels like the most present thing.</p><p>My closest friend, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/07/theater/adam-brace-dead.html" title="">Adam Brace</a>, and I started building something in 2018. It began when we sat down at a hotel bar in London and I tried to make him laugh. Adam had directed all of my solo shows, a process that always began with our trying to cobble together something more cohesive from the observational and anecdotal fragments I’d been building onstage in comedy clubs. I’d lob anecdotes and observations, and he’d offer argument and provocation and, occasionally, unleash a guffaw that meant I had something.</p><p>That night in London, an hour and a few ciders in, I told Adam about a meeting of white nationalists I had attended in Queens a month before. Adam chuckled through the retelling, familiar with Judaism and my neuroses. Two days later, the story of that infiltration gone sideways was the backbone of a show called “Just for Us.”</p><p>We developed it over three years in any venue that would have it — pubs in Northern England, comedy clubs in the American Southwest, shoe-box Greek cultural centers in Australia. When Adam couldn’t be there, I’d send him recordings. He’d point out things most comedians would never think about, like where the show should find stillness and when a longer joke slowed the narrative’s momentum. Adam thought that solo shows should answer the question: What is our place in the world? I looked after the jokes, and he looked after that.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The show finally arrived at the Cherry Lane Theater in Greenwich Village and after a few nights, New York audiences found it. Three weeks at Cherry Lane turned into a year and a half as the show climbed the ladder to nicer and nicer theaters in other cities. An amused Adam flew over from his home in England to sleep on my couch and help restage it every time we opened in a new venue. Finally and improbably, in the spring of 2023, we found out the show would move to the Hudson Theater. It would be the Broadway debut for both of us.</p><p>Less than two months later, suddenly and very inconsiderately, given his numerous theatrical responsibilities, Adam died. He was 43 years old.</p><p>Unreal. Unfair. All the mourning superlatives applied. There was anger, bargaining and whatever stage of grief makes you burst into tears in a Sweetgreen on the Upper West Side. And, impossible to ignore, the Broadway opening was rushing up on me. Adam’s funeral was the day before tech rehearsals began.</p><p>We had built a house together, and now I was going to have to live in it by myself. And the question that I had was: How?</p><p>“We don’t have to do the run,” one of my producers said. “We can cancel.”</p><p>“Is that really an option?”</p></div></div><div><div><p>She coughed. “Not really.”</p><p>There was a preview in my hometown, Boston, before the show opened on Broadway, and I turned in a performance only a parent could take pride in. I forgot a full five minutes of jokes, lost the narrative thread of the show twice and had to pause to find it in a panic I hadn’t felt onstage since I was doing open mics. My first thought afterward was that Adam would have been apoplectic. I was about to screw up our thing.</p><p>The unlucky irony was that usually I find performance to be an escape.</p><p>Right before I go onstage, like a bedside lamp, I turn on. Before the show, there are five seconds of blackout between the moment the house lights go down and the stage lights come up, and I try to dump everything that isn’t the weird symmetry of looseness and focus that I need into the area outside the delineated performance space. I open my mouth and let all the butterflies in my stomach fly around somewhere else for as long as I’m out there.</p><p>The administration of live comedy is both granular and broad. At least for me, there are countless minute determinations — some drilled into me by Adam — centering on what’s happening behind my eyes and in front of them. Your tone is too samey; modulate it. Don’t cross the stage while delivering important dialogue, lest the crowd focus on your movement instead of what you’re saying. Don’t laugh at your own jokes, but remember the joy with which you wrote them. The audience house left doesn’t seem as engaged; can we pull them in by spending more time over there?</p><p>Well, no escaping here. For each joke in “Just for Us,” I had a dozen conversations with Adam about how to deliver it, or if the joke even merited real estate in the show. There’s a stupid line about a fat horse, and it only works if it’s told a certain way. Adam and I argued about how to tell it for like three weeks. It needed to be muttered, but not too low, or the audience would miss it. In Boston, I started to choke up when I got to the line. It didn’t land.</p><p>In our first week on Broadway, though, two things happened in quick succession. First, an avalanche of people moved into the house. As far as grief practices go, I would not recommend performing a 90-minute solo show about a meeting of white nationalists in Queens. I think you’d be better served lighting a candle or cooking a favorite meal. But if you’ve signed a contract and they’ve already printed the programs, I’d recommend doing it the way that I got to do it: with friends and family and strangers offering help, plus producers, crew members and patrons. I hadn’t counted on all the other people. Broadway actors, most of whom I had never met, offered welcome, helpful advice. A friend insisted I move out of my apartment and into his for the duration of the run. On the shortest possible notice, a director Adam and I both admired stepped in to fill that huge hole. Adam’s partner and family flew in for our opening night.</p></div></div><div><div><p>I was still grasping through the experience when a friend asked if there was somewhere else I’d rather be. I realized there wasn’t. The experience of grieving Adam was going to be braided with the thing that could bring me closest to him, which was a gift. The show had always been a conversation between us. Why should that stop? We had worked on it together, and after a day spent thinking about him, I got to go onstage and live inside our collaboration. For 12 hours I’d walk around in a fog, but for 90 minutes I was fully present. Doing the show felt painful but appropriate, like reciting Kaddish, the Jewish daily mourning prayer.</p><p>That gift grew in intensity, though. I started looking for him in the audience. He’d visited the Hudson Theater before he died — before I’d even seen it — and we’d talked about how to play the space. I was stuck trying to execute a routine for a figure skating judge who’d left the arena. And even though I was back in conversation with Adam, the one-sidedness felt unbearable. The show moved to a tour, and my desperation overwhelmed the good parts. In Berkeley, Calif., during a pause in the show — which was planned — I heard myself mutter, “Where <em>are</em> you, man?” — which was not.</p><p>My dad pointed out that you stop saying Kaddish after 11 months. In mourning in Judaism, you eventually let go and try to move on. I decided to stop the tour at the very end of March, 11 months after Adam died. About 10 minutes before the end of the last show, at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, the last venue Adam had talked to me about playing, I realized that Adam had said all he was going to say. Which was fine. He’d done enough.</p><p>And now I’m almost, truly finished with “Just for Us.” A filmed version came out on HBO in April, and its relative permanence was a comfort. When theaters are empty crew members leave a single bulb lit onstage, so the theater is never completely dark. The practical reason is for safety, but the superstitious ones — it’s called a ghost light — are more interesting. I think of the HBO special as something akin to that.</p><p>The night before the last Broadway show — for legal reasons I should say this is made up, but if I meet you in the street I’ll show you pictures — I slept inside the Hudson. I kept quiet when the night watchmen came to check the dressing rooms and then I padded out on the stage in my socks next to the ghost light. I sat next to it for an hour, quietly, trying to listen. I felt sad and unspeakably grateful.</p></div></div><div><div><p>I’m doing better, though I still can’t believe that Adam is dead. I cannot believe that he is dead all of the time. You think he’d at least take a break for a big awards show or one of the larger publicity events. We’ve had free cider at a couple of functions, and he’s been so busy being dead he hasn’t partaken at all, which is unlike him.</p><p>I’ve sold our house. To anyone who cares to watch a comedy special, at least.</p><p>What am I left with? More than enough. Crew members and producers who have become family, laughs from more audience members than I’m likely to ever encounter again. The profound experience of writing, tinkering, performing and grieving in every hemisphere. And one completed conversation about everything that is important to me: what our place in the world is, how to express it ferociously and the exact right volume to utter a joke about a horse.</p></div></div><div></div><div><div><p>Alex Edelman is a comedian.
