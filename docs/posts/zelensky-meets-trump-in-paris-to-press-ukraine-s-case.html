Trump in Paris on Saturday, the first face-to-face encounter between the two since Mr. Trump won the U.S. presidential election last month after claiming that he would end the war in 24 hours.</p><p>Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky were brought together by President Emmanuel Macron of France at the Élysée Palace on Saturday evening, ahead of the Notre-Dame Cathedral’s grand reopening. It was a diplomatic coup for the French leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/world/europe/macron-france-prime-minister.html" title="">who is otherwise facing a political crisis at home</a> after his government fell this week.</p><p>While it was not immediately clear what was said in the meeting, Mr. Zelensky was expected to press Ukraine’s case to Mr. Trump, amid concerns that his pledge to end the war quickly could leave Kyiv sacrificing substantial territory to Russia and lacking the security guarantees needed to deter future aggression.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky said afterward that it had been a “productive meeting” and he thanked Mr. Trump for his determination and Mr. Macron for organizing the encounter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We talked about our people, the situation on the battlefield and a just peace for Ukraine. We all want to end this war as quickly and fairly as possible,” the Ukrainian leader <a href="https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/12698" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>, adding that they had “agreed to continue working together.”</p><p>The meeting appeared to be part of a broader diplomatic push by Ukraine to engage with Mr. Trump’s incoming administration and influence its plans to end to the war with Russia in a way that aligns as much as possible with Kyiv’s interests. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-trump.html" title="">a delegation of senior Ukrainian officials traveled to the United States</a> to meet with several of Mr. Trump’s key appointees.</p><p>“What is happening now is just the first act of a prelude to the negotiations to come,” Volodymyr Fesenko, a Ukrainian political analyst, wrote in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vladimir.fesenko1/posts/27787860230862459?ref=embed_post" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on Facebook</a> about the Ukrainian delegation’s visit to the United States.</p><p>Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky were slated to attend the reopening of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, but it remained uncertain until the last moment whether they would meet. They eventually spoke at the Élysée Palace, in what appeared to be a carefully choreographed entrance.</p><p>Mr. Macron greeted Mr. Trump at the Élysée Palace at 4:45 p.m. local time. Around 45 minutes later, Mr. Zelensky’s car pulled into the palace courtyard. The Ukrainian president stepped out, ascended the red-carpeted stairs, and entered the 18th-century building to join the French and American leaders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>They posed for pictures ahead of the trilateral meeting, which lasted about 30 minutes. “United States, Ukraine, and France. Together on this historic day. Gathered for Notre-Dame. Let us continue our joint efforts for peace and security,” Mr. Macron <a href="https://x.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/1865455792683434384" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in a social media post</a> which included a picture of them talking under the gilded halls of the Élysée Palace.</p><p>Then the three leaders shook hands at they exited the palace, heading to the reopening ceremony of Notre-Dame Cathedral.</p><p>The event had been seen by Ukraine as a chance to press its case to the dozens of world leaders in attendance. Mr. Zelensky said he had met with Karl Nehammer, the Chancellor of Austria, and Salome Zourabichvili, the president of Georgia.</p><p>Sounding out Mr. Trump on his plans to end the war has been a top priority for Ukraine. These plans have so far been unclear, but officials in Kyiv are concerned that Mr. Trump’s vague pledge to end the war in 24 hours could result in Russia keeping the territory it has captured and ignoring Ukraine’s demand to join NATO as a security guarantee to prevent further attacks.</p><p>Ukraine’s outreach to Mr. Trump’s team has coincided with an apparent shift in Kyiv’s public stance on peace talks. After years of vowing not to cede territory to Russia, Mr. Zelensky has recently suggested he would consider doing so as a way to end the war, in return for NATO membership. Ukraine, he added, would then seek to regain its occupied territory through negotiations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The change in position has been seen as a way for Ukraine to show Mr. Trump that it is ready to make concessions as part of negotiations. By contrast, Ukraine officials have insisted that Russia didn’t want to engage in negotiations, especially as its troops are steadily gaining ground on the battlefield.</p><p>Before Saturday’s meeting, Mr. Zelensky had already spoken with Mr. Trump three times this year: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/20/us/politics/trump-zelensky-call-ukraine.html" title="">in a phone call over the summer</a>, during a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/world/europe/zelensky-trump-ukraine-russia-war.html" title="">meeting in New York in September</a> and in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/us/politics/trump-musk-zelensky.html" title="">another call shortly after Mr. Trump’s election last month</a>.</p><p>In an <a href="https://news.sky.com/video/sky-news-speaks-exclusively-to-president-zelenskyy-about-putin-nato-and-trump-13263345" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview with Sky News</a> last week, Mr. Zelensky said he wanted to work with Mr. Trump “directly” and was open to his proposals. “I want to share with him ideas, and I want to hear from his ideas,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>12</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Macron Wins Zelensky Another Chance to Press Ukraine’s Case to Trump<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Trump Transition: News and Analysis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Biden’s Team Considers Blanket Pardons:</strong> President Biden’s staff is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/biden-trump-pardons.html">debating blanket pardons</a> for a swath of President-elect Donald Trump’s perceived enemies to protect them from the “retribution” he has threatened, according to people familiar with the discussion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Urban Shift Toward Trump:</strong> Big cities have faced serious problems lately.
