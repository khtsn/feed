    <h1>Man Is Accused of Killing 2 in Random Stabbings in Manhattan</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Today, we have three innocent New Yorkers who were victims of a terrible, terrible assault,” Mr. Adams said. The stabbings, he added, were “a clear example of a criminal justice system and a mental health system that continues to fail New Yorkers.”</p><p>The stabbing spree began shortly before 8:30 a.m. on West 19th Street near Eighth Avenue, where a knife-wielding assailant, without warning, stabbed a 36-year-old construction worker in the abdomen outside the job site where he was employed, Joseph Kenny, the Police Department’s chief of detectives, said at the news conference.</p><p>The construction worker was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Chief Kenny said.</p><p>About two hours later, the attacker struck again, this time on East 30th Street near Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, repeatedly stabbing a 68-year-old man who was fishing in the East River at the time, Chief Kenny said. That victim was also pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital.</p><p>The third attack occurred about a half-hour later, when a 36-year-old woman was stabbed several times at 42nd Street and First Avenue, near the United Nations, Chief Kenny said. She was taken to NewYork Presbyterian-Weill Cornell Medical Center in critical condition.</p></div></div>
