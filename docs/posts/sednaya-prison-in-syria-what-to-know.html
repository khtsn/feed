Once they returned home, Mr. al-Assad jailed them to prevent them from threatening his rule.</p><p>As antigovernment protests spread across Syria in early 2011, the government <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/media/4698" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released</a> many of those jihadists and began imprisoning thousands of protesters, activists, journalists, doctors, aid workers, students and other Syrians. Many were sent to Sednaya.</p><p>The prison was the last place detainees were often dumped after long periods in other detention centers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former detainees described abysmal, overcrowded cells at Sednaya prison.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-716a0ccd">What were the conditions?</h2><p>The Amnesty report and a separate investigation by the United Nations found that the Syrian authorities had deliberately exterminated detainees at Sednaya after torturing and housing them in appalling conditions. The U.N. investigators determined that such acts could amount to crimes against humanity.</p><p>The detainees were sexually assaulted, beaten on the genitals and forced to beat, rape or even kill one another, according to rights groups and a Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/world/middleeast/syria-torture-prisons.html" title="">investigation</a>. In 2017, the United States accused the Syrian government of using a crematory to hide <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/world/middleeast/syria-assad-prison-crematory.html" title="">mass murders in Sednaya</a>, listing <a href="https://www.state.gov/report/custom/709c037e97/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">methods of physical torture</a> such as beatings, stabbings, sexual assault, electric shocks and cutting off ears and genitals.</p><p>The few who won release, often through family connections or bribes, described detainees left to die of untreated wounds and illnesses in filthy, overcrowded cells. Prisoners were given just seconds to use latrines, so were often forced to relieve themselves in the cells, which lacked toilets. Meals usually consisted of a few mouthfuls of spoiled food. Many people developed serious infections, diseases and mental illnesses.</p><p>The conditions were similar at many prisons across the system. But at Sednaya, treatment could be especially sadistic, according to ex-inmates.</p><p>Prisoners were not allowed to look at the guards, talk or make any noise, even during torture. They could be punished by being denied water or forced to sleep naked, without blankets, in freezing cold.</p><p>Every morning, guards collected the bodies of those who had died overnight and took them to a military hospital, where their deaths were recorded as cases of heart or respiratory failure, according to the Amnesty report. Then, they were trucked to mass graves outside Damascus.</p><p>Loved ones outside the prison often never knew their fates. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Relatives in the morgue area of Damascus Hospital looking on Tuesday for the bodies of loved ones who had been taken to Sednaya prison. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-7e9e5ae7">A grim protocol</h2><p>According to former officials cited in the Amnesty report, detainees at Sednaya were routinely tortured into giving confessions. Then they were taken to military field courts, where they were convicted after trials that lasted two or three minutes.</p><p>Every week and often twice a week, according to the report, guards pulled groups of up to 50 people from their cells, telling them they were being transferred to civilian prisons. Instead, they were blindfolded, beaten severely in the prison’s basement and then taken to another building, where they were hanged in the middle of the night, the report said.</p><p>Prison officials called the mass hangings “the party.”</p><p>From 2011 to 2015, Amnesty found, 5,000 to 13,000 people, most of them civilians, were put to death in this way. The group did not have direct evidence of executions after 2015, but because detainees were still being transferred to Sednaya and sham trials still being held, it was likely the executions continued.</p><h2 id="link-46c54352">What is happening now at the prison?</h2><p>Some 2,000 prisoners emerged from Sednaya on Sunday, according to Fadel Abdul Ghany, the director of the Syrian Network for Human Rights, which has rigorously monitored Mr. al-Assad’s labyrinth of prisons. But the rest of the approximately 11,000 detainees who he said were being held there when the government was overthrown were nowhere to be found.</p><p>“Where are the remaining prisoners?” Mr. Abdul Ghany said. “They have been killed.”</p><p>Still, in the confusion, different groups had different estimates of the numbers, and many Syrians held out hope that their disappeared relatives could still be found. Journalists, armed fighters and civilians, including children, roamed the prison, looking for signs of them.</p><p>“Seizing the city is a joy — we are joyous,” said one rebel fighter, Mohammad Bakir. “But the real victory will be when I find my family.” He had not heard from his mother, brother and cousin since they disappeared in 2012 after protesting against the government.</p><p>Videos sent to The Times by a group of doctors visiting Sednaya <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/09/world/syria-assad-rebels/footage-shows-a-chaotic-scene-after-rebels-capture-a-notorious-prison?smid=url-share" title="">showed crowding and the dire conditions</a> inside. Numbered cells, each of which appear to have held a dozen or more people, were littered with debris, clothing and belongings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-11"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Syrians made the trek to the prison to find news of people they knew on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Syrians heading to the prison on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The White Helmets, a volunteer civil defense organization in Syria, said it had <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/9/dead-bodies-in-ovens-syrian-rescuers-free-prisoners-from-sednaya-jail" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">helped to release about 20,000 to 25,000 people</a> from Sednaya, but noted that thousands more prisoners remained unaccounted for.</p><p>The group sent <a href="https://x.com/SyriaCivilDef/status/1866142017169785166" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">specialized teams to Sednaya</a> looking for secret cells that might hold more prisoners, based on reports that it has hidden elements.
