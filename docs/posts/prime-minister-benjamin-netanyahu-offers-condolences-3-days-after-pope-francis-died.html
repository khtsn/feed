Mr. Netanyahu usually issues condolence statements shortly after the deaths of world leaders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Francis, who frequently phoned members of Gaza’s dwindling Christian community, took advantage of major addresses to the Catholic world to call for the entry of humanitarian aid to Gaza, a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by militants.</p><p>“My thoughts go especially to the victims of the many conflicts worldwide, beginning with those in Israel and Palestine,” he said during Easter Sunday Mass in 2024.</p><p>Since early March, Israel has blocked the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, leaving many people in Gaza struggling to access food.</p><p>In a book released in November 2024, Francis said the war in Gaza should be investigated to determine whether it constituted a genocide. The statement drew a harsh rebuke from a member of Mr. Netanyahu’s government, Amichai Chikli, the minister of diaspora affairs, who contended it was a “trivialization” of the term genocide. Israeli officials say that Israel is waging a war against Hamas in Gaza and not civilians. They also argue that it is Hamas that should face charges of genocide <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/30/world/middleeast/israeli-military-hamas-failures.html" title="">after its attack on Oct. 7</a>, 2023, when about 1,200 people were killed in Israel and roughly 250 were taken captive. The pope also met with the families of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas.</p><p>More than 51,000 people in Gaza have been killed since the war began, according to the health ministry in the territory, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In 2014, Francis visited Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where he called for a “sovereign homeland” for Palestinians. He also became the first pontiff to refer to the occupied territory as “the State of Palestine.”</p><p>Isaac Herzog, Israel’s largely ceremonial president, was one of the first leaders to issue a statement mourning the death of Francis.</p><p>But on the day of the pope’s death, Israel’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement on X, saying ”may his memory be a blessing.” But shortly thereafter, the ministry deleted the post.</p><p>After facing <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjtuamhyge" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticism in Israel</a>, the ministry reposted a picture of its ambassador to the Holy See, Yaron Sideman, visiting the pope’s coffin in the Vatican. Ambassador Sideman will represent Israel at the pope’s funeral, according to Oren Marmorstein, the Foreign Ministry spokesman.</p><p>In a statement, Mr. Marmorstein did not explicitly address the deletion of the X post, but emphasized that Israeli diplomats around the world have offered their condolences on social media and signed official condolence books.</p><p>Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Pope Francis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Cardinal en Route to a Conclave:</strong> Timothy Dolan of New York is one of 10 cardinals from the United States who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/cardinal-dolan-pope-francis-conclave.html">will have a vote in the ritual that will determine the next pope</a> and was among the first to make his way to Rome.</p></li><li><p><strong>Whither Progressive Christians After Pope Francis?:</strong> Millions of progressive Christians in the United States, Catholics and non-Catholics alike, considered Pope Francis to be a powerful counterweight to a rising conservative Christian power.
