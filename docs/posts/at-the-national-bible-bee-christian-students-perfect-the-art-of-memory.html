But lately, the 9-year-old from Sugar Land, Texas, has been spending most of his free time memorizing Bible verses.</p><p>On Thursday morning under spotlights on a stage in Orlando, Fla., Daniel smoothly recited 19 verses from the New Testament book of Romans to win the finals for his age group at the 16th annual National Bible Bee.</p><p>“For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think,” Daniel began, reciting the 350-word passage from Romans 12.</p><p>He was one of about 360 children and teenagers assembled this week for a competition whose slogan is “To know God’s Word and make Him known.” </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Bee has achieved a quiet kind of celebrity status in some Christian circles, and video clips of its young competitors sometimes circulate beyond those communities on social media. The competition demands astonishing feats of memorization that make the televised National Spelling Bee look like a game of tic-tac-toe. Competitors at Daniel’s level memorized more than 570 verses, which they were expected to be able to recite on command.</p><p>At the senior level, ages 15 to 18, participants memorize 938 Bible verses, adding up to more than 20,000 words. In some rounds of competition, making even a single error in a long passage — an errant plural or wrong verb tense — leads to elimination.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/15/multimedia/15nat-Bible-Bee-dippy-1--01-tvjf/15nat-Bible-Bee-dippy-1--01-tvjf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/15/multimedia/15nat-Bible-Bee-dippy-1--01-tvjf/15nat-Bible-Bee-dippy-1--01-tvjf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/15/multimedia/15nat-Bible-Bee-dippy-1--01-tvjf/15nat-Bible-Bee-dippy-1--01-tvjf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Onstage, a huge signs says “Truth” with a cross underneath, and contestants stand with their hands clasped." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/15/multimedia/15nat-Bible-Bee-dippy-1--01-tvjf/15nat-Bible-Bee-dippy-1--01-tvjf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/15/multimedia/15nat-Bible-Bee-dippy-1--01-tvjf/15nat-Bible-Bee-dippy-1--01-tvjf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/15/multimedia/15nat-Bible-Bee-dippy-1--01-tvjf/15nat-Bible-Bee-dippy-1--01-tvjf-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/15/multimedia/15nat-Bible-Bee-dippy-1--01-tvjf/15nat-Bible-Bee-dippy-1--01-tvjf-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/9e527896-3463-5c5c-baf8-6440bccc2005" decoding="async" width="600" height="480"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>About 360 contestants assembled for the competition this week.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Daniel Chew’s family rushed the stage to embrace him after his win.

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>This Instagram post is from the 2023 Bible Bee.</p><p>Memorization of sacred texts is embedded in many religious traditions. For conservative Protestants in particular, memorizing Bible verses has long played a role in Sunday school classes and church youth clubs like Awana.</p><p>But memorization seems to be having a resurgence, through events like the Bible Bee and ScriptureFest, a series of regional performances. The rise coincides with a broader emphasis on recitation in many home-school and classical school curriculums, which have shaped many Bible Bee competitors.</p><p>Participation has grown significantly since its first gathering in 2009, and it has doubled since 2021, according to Mr. Mullins. This year, almost 13,000 young people took part in the summer training program that feeds into the competition, a record “by far,” he said.</p><p>“Memorization speaks not only to the mind but also to the soul,” said Michael P. Farris, the chair of the Shelby Kennedy Foundation, the producer of the Bible Bee. Mr. Farris, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/us/politics/religious-conservative-michael-farris-lawsuit-2020-election.html" title="">high-profile conservative lawyer</a>, recalled his childhood Sunday school teacher promising a reward of a hamburger, milkshake and fries for any child who could memorize and recite <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2013&amp;version=NKJV" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 13</a>. (In his recollection, he was the only child who did so.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The prizes at the Bible Bee are considerably more valuable. This year’s senior winner, Maret Haab of Jenison, Mich., 18, will take home $50,000. Daniel Chew earned $10,000 for winning the primary level, ages 7 to 10, and his older sister, Abby, 14, won $20,000 for winning at the junior level, ages 11 to 14.</p><p>The contest is particularly popular among home-schooling families like the Chews, who first heard about it a decade ago through the Home School Legal Defense Association, an advocacy group founded by Mr. Farris. The organization’s partners include prominent conservative Christian groups including the Family Research Council, Alliance Defending Freedom and Patrick Henry College.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hosanna Brown, like other contestants, earned points by recognizing Bible verses from descriptions read by judges.

The contestants called adults “ma’am” and “sir.” The boys onstage had tucked in their shirts; almost every girl wore her hair and hemlines long. At one point in the final, Abby Chew raised her hand to inform the judges that she had been mistakenly awarded points for an incorrect answer. In the audience, rows of younger siblings sat still for hours in almost miraculous silence.</p><p>Boys and girls seem to excel equally at the competition. But it is otherwise a space that celebrates traditional gender roles.</p><p>“I desire to be a wife and mother and raise a godly home-schooling family,” one finalist in the junior level told the judges when asked about her goals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-19"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="bible-bee-embed" data-id="100000009828131" data-source-id="100000009828131"><div slug="bible-bee-embed" data-sourceid="100000009828131" id="embed-id-100000009828131">

Many passages are complex, dense with the names of ancient kings and tribes.</p><p>Selections this year included verses like, “Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent to gather the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces.”</p><p>In other parts of the competition, competitors also answer questions on general Bible knowledge, such as “According to Jeremiah 52, who was King Nebuchadnezzar’s captain/commander that set fire to Jerusalem?”</p><p>The answer was Nebuzaradan, which three of five contestants answered correctly.</p><p>Many families see Bible memorization as a path to instill discipline, organizational skills and comfort with public speaking.

He quoted a verse in the gospel of John, in which Jesus promises his followers the gift of peace.</p><p>“This is a gift that social media is not going to give you,” he said. “This is a gift that money is not going to give you, or illicit sex is not going to give you, or switching your gender is not going to give you.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>On Thursday evening, after the competition was over, many competitors and their families gathered in a lobby outside the hotel ballroom for an informal social.</p><p>There was barely a cellphone to be seen.
