Fighting for Ukraine in the eastern Donetsk region, he said he could hear explosions throughout the night, despite the Kremlin’s promise of a truce for Easter.</p><p>Mr. Hnezdilov, 24, said Ukrainian soldiers were told to report to their superiors all violations of the cease-fire, which was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/world/europe/russia-ukraine-easter-truce.html" title="">abruptly declared</a> by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Saturday afternoon and later agreed to halfheartedly by skeptical Ukrainian officials. In addition, Mr. Hnezdilov said, some planned Ukrainian military operations had been put on hold.</p><p>“I don’t even know how to assess this so-called cease-fire,” said Mr. Hnezdilov, whose 56th Mariupol Brigade is fighting near the town of Chasiv Yar. “To me, it was just words from Putin like, ‘We won’t shoot,’ but they are shooting,” he said in an interview on Sunday, adding: “Every so-called cease-fire with the Russians gets violated by the Russians immediately.”</p><p>The truce, announced as lasting 30 hours, appeared to be a gambit by Mr. Putin to show the United States that Russia was serious about peace.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Friday, the Trump administration had indicated that if it could not make progress in ending the war, it would walk away. What that meant was unclear. Would the United States stop leading peace negotiations, yet continue to supply Ukraine with weapons and military intelligence? Or would Washington wash its hands of the war and abandon Ukraine?</p><p>Without U.S. help, Ukraine’s ability to continue fighting is tenuous. As the military aid initially authorized under President Joseph R. Biden Jr. slows to a trickle, Ukraine has been able to win more military help from Europe. But it also depends on the United States for essential military intelligence and targeting data, and for the Patriot missiles used in its air defenses.</p><p>The truce — announced by Mr. Putin less than two hours before it was to start at 6 p.m. local time Saturday — did mean a quieter night than usual.</p><p>But both Ukraine and Russia claimed on Sunday that attacks had continued overnight, with the other side responsible for violating the cease-fire. Russian troops fired their artillery more than 445 times between 6 p.m. Saturday and noon Sunday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in social media posts. He also said the Russians had launched 45 infantry assaults and used drones more than 300 times.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Ukrainian military chaplain performing an Easter benediction next to the charred remnants of a church in Kamyanka, a village in the Kharkiv region.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Russia’s defense ministry said on Sunday that its forces had observed the truce, while accusing Ukraine of violating it with drones and nighttime attacks in the Donetsk region. The ministry provided its own numbers: Ukraine had fired 444 times from guns and mortars and carried out 900 drone strikes.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It was not possible to independently confirm the claims by either side.</p><p>Both Kyiv and Moscow said that fighting in the Russian border regions of Bryansk, Kursk and Belgorod had continued.</p><p>Vlad Krupko, 26, a Ukraine drone unit commander near the border of Kharkiv, Luhansk, and Donetsk regions, said in an interview that the fighting during the cease-fire was similar to how it had been since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Russians continued to launch drones and artillery strikes. His team also conducted combat drone flights. “So in reality, there was no cease-fire at all,” he added.</p><p>Mr. Trump has made ending the war in Ukraine one of his foreign-policy goals. But his administration has largely echoed Russian talking points so far, saying that occupied parts of Ukraine should be ceded to Russia and that Kyiv should not be able to join NATO, and questioning <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/world/trump-putin-russia-ukraine.html" title="">Mr. Zelensky’s</a> legitimacy. There is no serious talk in the White House or in Congress of sending more military aid to Ukraine. Mr. Trump has made his disdain for Mr. Zelensky clear, as well as his affinity for Mr. Putin.</p><p>Ukraine is largely at the mercy of whatever the Trump administration decides, if it wants any chance of more American help. When Mr. Trump briefly paused both military intelligence and military aid in March, after a public blowup with Mr. Zelensky in the White House, the loss of military intelligence was felt almost immediately along the front lines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>So Mr. Zelensky has agreed and agreed, trying to look like the reasonable party compared with Mr. Putin. He agreed to a 30-day temporary cease-fire proposed by Mr. Trump in late March. He agreed to pursue a contentious revenue-sharing minerals deal that was originally supposed to be signed at the disastrous White House meeting. That deal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/world/europe/ukraine-us-minerals-agreement.html" title="">could be finalized</a> as soon as this week.</p><p>By contrast, Mr. Putin has not agreed to much of anything concrete during preliminary talks with U.S. officials.</p><p>Friday seemed to be a breaking point. U.S. officials made it clear that they were exasperated with Russia’s unwillingness to accept the 30-day cease-fire proposal.</p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States could decide within days to “move on” from trying to end the war. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/politics/trump-rubio-putin-ukraine.html" title="">Mr. Trump said</a> that “if for some reason one of the two parties makes it very difficult,” the United States could decide that “we’re just going to take a pass.”</p><p>Only Vice President JD Vance sounded more upbeat, saying that the United States was optimistic about putting an end to the war — although he did not say how.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Then on Saturday afternoon, Mr. Putin ordered his forces to “stop all military activity” against Ukraine for 30 hours.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials expressed skepticism about Mr. Putin’s intentions, but eventually, likely mindful of Mr. Trump’s desire for a cease-fire, Mr. Zelensky said Ukrainian troops would do whatever Russian troops did. If they were silent, Ukrainian troops would stop fighting. If Russian troops attacked, so would the Ukrainians.</p><p>“Our soldiers are responding everywhere as the enemy deserves,” he said in a social media post Sunday morning.</p><p>In another clear signal to Washington, Mr. Zelensky reiterated several times over the weekend that Ukraine would like to extend the Easter truce for 30 days.</p><p>On Sunday, Ukrainian analysts largely dismissed the temporary cease-fire as a public-relations stunt. They were much more concerned about what it meant if the U.S. administration pulled out of any role in the peace negotiations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“This is the big question to us Ukrainians: What do they mean by being out?” asked Volodymyr Dubovyk, the director of the Center for International Studies at Odesa I.I. Mechnikov National University. “Does it actually mean that they are completely ignoring the conflict from now on, if they are out? Or will intelligence sharing still be coming to Ukraine? Will satellite imagery still be coming to Ukraine?”</p><p>The minerals deal, if signed, could give Ukraine some kind of leverage to be able to get more U.S. weapons or at the least to continue receiving U.S. military intelligence, analysts said.</p><p>Easter is one of the most important holidays of the year in Ukraine. On the Thursday before Easter — called Clean Thursday — Ukrainians typically clean their houses. Life grinds to a halt on Good Friday. Spare time is devoted to elaborately decorating eggs and baking special Easter cakes.</p><p>But no one in Ukraine seemed to see Mr. Putin’s truce offer as a gift. Video posted online Sunday showed Russian drones attacking an evacuation vehicle near the city of Kostiantynivka in Donetsk, injuring the occupants.</p><p>On Sunday morning, villagers in Kamyanka in the eastern Kharkiv region attended an Easter benediction next to the charred remnants of a church that was destroyed during the village’s five months of Russian occupation, which killed about 150 civilians and destroyed homes, shops and farms.</p><p>Iryna Trotsko, 52, said in an interview that she would never trust the Russians. “They don’t keep their word or any of the promises they make to us,” she said.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Tyler Hicks<!-- --> from Kamyanka, Ukraine, by <!-- -->Andrew E. Kramer<!-- --> and <!-- -->Oleksandra Mykolyshyn<!-- --> from Kyiv, by <!-- -->Yurii Shyvala<!-- --> from Lviv and by <!-- -->Anton Troianovski<!-- --> from Berlin.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kim Barker is a Times reporter writing in-depth stories about the war in Ukraine.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Peace Negotiations</strong><strong>: </strong>Many Russians thought <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/world/europe/russia-ukraine-putin-trump.html">President Trump would be able to end the war</a>.
