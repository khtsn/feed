They also came as Hezbollah <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/24/world/europe/israel-lebanon-hezbollah.html" title="">fired about 250 projectiles into Israel</a> on Sunday, one of the group’s largest aerial attacks over the past year.</p><p>Analysts said that Israel’s ramped up attacks in recent days were intended to pressure Hezbollah into accepting a cease-fire on favorable terms. Hezbollah, however, has shown few signs of backing down, and both sides have pledged to keep up their attacks while negotiations are taking place.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>There were no immediate reports of casualties from Israel’s strikes late on Sunday. The Dahiya, once a bustling cluster of neighborhoods that are home to hundreds of thousands of people, has been almost entirely emptied in recent weeks because of intense airstrikes.</p><p>The Israeli military said in a statement late on Sunday that it had struck 12 “command centers” in the Dahiya that it described as belonging to Hezbollah.</p><p>Rescuers were still searching through rubble on Sunday from an earlier Israeli strike that killed 29 people in central Beirut, according to Lebanon’s ministry of health. Attacks in the heart of the city are much rarer than those in the Dahiya, but Israel has conducted several over the past week as the conflict has intensified.</p><p>The intensified strikes near Lebanon’s capital came as negotiators from the United States have been pressing for a cease-fire agreement to end the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Israeli troops have also pushed deeper into southern Lebanon in recent days, and on Sunday issued evacuation warnings for five villages there.</p><p>The terms for a cease-fire<span>  </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-lebanon.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">appear to be taking shape</a>, according to several regional and U.S. officials briefed on the diplomacy. Last week, a top American envoy, Amos Hochstein, traveled to Lebanon and Israel to advance the talks. Officials were cautiously optimistic following the meetings but warned that critical details around implementation and enforcement needed to be worked out and that disagreements could still scuttle any deal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Israeli airstrikes over the past two months have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/iran-hezbollah-israel-nasrallah-strike.html" title="">decimated Hezbollah’s leadership</a>, severely <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/politics/israel-hezbollah-rockets.html" title="">degraded its military capabilities</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/world/middleeast/lebanon-refugees-israel-bombing.html" title="">displaced over a million people</a> in Lebanon. That has pushed the group’s remaining leaders, and their backers in Iran, toward interest in an agreement that could stop further damage, according to officials who speak with the group.</p><p>In a video address on Wednesday, Hezbollah’s new leader, Naim Qassem, said his group had made some comments on the proposed agreement, showing that “we have agreed to this path of indirect negotiation.”</p><p>Hezbollah’s two conditions, he said, were that an agreement stop all Israeli attacks on Lebanon and that it preserve Lebanese sovereignty.</p><p>Israel began an intensified <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-lebanon-invasion-map.html" title="">military campaign</a> against Hezbollah in September in response to almost a year of near-daily rocket attacks on northern Israel. Hezbollah said the attacks were in solidarity with its ally, Hamas, in Gaza. The war has become the bloodiest conflict inside Lebanon since the country’s 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Euan Ward is a reporter contributing to The Times from Beirut.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/euan-ward">More about Euan Ward</a></span></p></div><div><div><p>Ephrat Livni is a reporter for The Times’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/dealbook">DealBook</a> newsletter, based in Washington.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ephrat-livni">More about Ephrat Livni</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hezbollah">Hezbollah</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">The Israel Hamas War</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
