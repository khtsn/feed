They are cut off from academics, friends and stabilizing routines.</p><p>Hurricane Helene ravaged school buildings, demolished football fields and killed young children and their educators. Dozens of schools are closed for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Even when they reopen, students in the hardest hit regions, like western North Carolina, could face long-lasting academic and emotional setbacks, according to youth development experts. </p><p>In North Carolina, where more than 20 public school districts and several charter schools “face significant damage and interruptions,” according to Eric C. Davis, the chair of the state board of education, students and their families are facing “tremendous trauma and hardships.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Helene’s toll is extreme — more than 230 people have died — but such tragedies are increasingly on repeat.</p><p>As the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/climate/climate-changes-hurricane-intensity.html" title="">climate changes and storms grow bigger and more frequent</a>, they are disrupting the rhythm of school districts and threatening children’s academics, physical health and mental well-being.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The school superintendent in Asheville, Maggie Fehrman, says many teachers lost loved ones and homes.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Juan Diego Reyes for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Millions of students have lost crucial instruction time in recent years after hurricanes poured floodwater into schools or tore apart buildings. Schools have had to shutter more frequently during dangerous heat waves because old buildings lack air conditioning. In California, wildfires forced more than 220 schools to temporarily close between September and the first three days of October alone, according to the state’s Education Department.</p><p>These disasters can upend students’ lives in and out the classroom, <a href="https://www.srcd.org/research/understanding-impacts-natural-disasters-children" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researchers</a> say. Perhaps the starkest example is that of Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans in August 2005. An estimated 50,000 students did not <a href="https://www.childrensdefense.org/katrinas-children-still-struggling/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">return</a> to their classrooms for the entire school year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Young children process death and destruction in different ways. While many may bounce back quickly, for others, “it could take years to get over,” said Cassandra R. Davis, an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who <a href="https://epic.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1268/2021/09/NSF-1-Academic-Progress_Final_1.15.21.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">studied</a> the <a href="https://epic.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1268/2021/09/NSF-3-Attendance_Mental-Health_Behavior_Final_1.15.21.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">effects</a> of Hurricanes Matthew and Florence in the 2010s on children.</p><p>Her research found that some students in early grades fell behind academically for over a year. Others showed signs of long-lasting trauma, becoming emotional or anxious during rainy seasons — even months after a storm.</p><p>The recovery is often starkly uneven between rich and poor districts, widening inequality between schools. <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-104606.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Low-income communities</a> may receive less assistance to help children after a disaster, and families often have less means to flee harm’s way in the first place.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The football field at Asheville Middle School.

Some lost their homes. None of the district’s eight public schools have running water after the local <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/hurricane-helene-asheville-water.html" title="">infrastructure</a> sustained “critical damage.” Half lack electricity.</p><p>But Dr. Fehrman said the pandemic laid bare “the critical role that schools play in child development,” so the district plans to put on some football or softball games to help students gather until the buildings can fully reopen.</p><p>“Kids need normalcy,” she said in an interview. “They need structure. They need time to come together.”</p><p>Near Asheville, one campus at FernLeaf Community Charter School was devastated in the storm. Buildings were ripped off their foundations and flooded. Teachers lost all of their books and classroom materials. “Everything was absolutely ruined and destroyed beyond recovery,” said the executive director, Michael Luplow.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“It’s heartbreaking,” he said.</p><p>Douglas N. Harris, a Tulane University professor who has lived in western North Carolina and studied the impact of Hurricane Katrina on students, said it all “has to be pretty disheartening” for educators. “They had to go through Covid. Then they had to try to catch students up,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People gather outside a school in Asheville to receive supplies and connect to power and internet.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Juan Diego Reyes for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“And now it’s like, ‘We have to do this all over again,’” Mr. Harris said.</p><p>He added that disasters like Helene can be especially damaging because some children might not receive any form of an education for weeks.</p><p>“This isn’t Covid remote learning. This is nothing,” he said.</p><p>In Buncombe County Schools, the largest district in western North Carolina, with more than 22,000 students, virtual classes are not possible because internet access and cellphone service remain spotty. Dozens of schools still lack electricity, and many have doubled as shelters for paramedics and power crews.</p><p>“I wish we could use remote learning. But we just can’t,” the superintendent, Rob Jackson, said at a Thursday news conference. He adding, “We know our children need to be in school.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Many students in southern Appalachia have no idea when they will rejoin classmates.

A nearby high school football field had become a makeshift helicopter landing pad.</p><p>Kingston’s mother, Raven Echols, 37, said all four of her school-age children were growing fidgety without their classes, friends and sports.

One study she conducted <a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/sites/bc-magazine/summer-2022/linden-lane/children-and-natural-disasters.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> that eight months after Hurricane Ike in 2008, more than 40 percent of children reported continued sleep problems.</p><p>Research shows that about 10 percent could suffer from “chronic distress” that lasts for a year after a disaster, or even longer, Dr. Lai said.</p><p>Still, the vast majority of young people could ultimately recover in short time, she noted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kristen Ozuna and her daughter Amaya.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Juan Diego Reyes for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Kristen Ozuna, 36, said she hoped to get her 5-year-old daughter, Amaya, back into kindergarten as soon as possible to take her mind off the storm.
