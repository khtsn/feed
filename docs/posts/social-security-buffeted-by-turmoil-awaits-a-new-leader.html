Over the objections of longtime career civil servants <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/us/politics/social-security-musk-team-access.html" title="">pushed out of the agency</a>, the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency has moved swiftly to scrutinize its internal databases, deploying at least 10 staff members inside, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/elon-musk-antonio-gracias-social-security-administration.html" title="">a longtime confidant of Mr. Musk</a>.</p><p>At the same time, the acting commissioner, Leland Dudek, a former midlevel manager, has made a number of head-spinning moves. On Friday, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/us/politics/social-security-dudek-judge-doge.html" title="">threatened to shut down the system</a> used for all of the Social Security Administration’s work in response to a judge’s order — only to back down hours later.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The churn has alarmed many older and disabled Americans who rely on Social Security payments and worry it could become harder to gain access to them.</p><p>“It’s a lot of confusion, frankly a lot of chaos,” said Bill Sweeney, the vice president for government affairs at AARP, which represents older Americans. “People are terrified of what’s happening with Social Security. There’s a level of anxiety about this among our members that Congress, policymakers and the administration needs to take seriously.”</p><p>Some Democratic lawmakers say they are so concerned that the Trump administration is setting the agency up to fail that they sent <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/warren_wyden_letter_to_bisignano.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a letter</a> on Sunday asking Mr. Bisignano to promise not to privatize any of its components.</p><p>“We are gravely concerned about the current trajectory of the S.S.A. and more specifically, that those charged with leading it might profit off its destruction,” Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ron Wyden of Oregon wrote.</p><p>It remains to be seen how Mr. Bisignano, who described himself in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/02/05/fiserv-ceo-on-the-nomination-to-social-security-commisioner-role.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview on CNBC</a> as “fundamentally a DOGE person,” will navigate those questions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Bisignano, most recently at the helm of the payment processing giant Fiserv, has spent much of his career as a fixer for major financial institutions hoping to improve their back-end processes. In the CNBC interview, he said he planned to bring the same approach to Social Security.</p><p>“The objective is not to touch benefits,” he said. “The objective is to figure out, there could be fraud, waste and abuse in there. And we build A.I. to find fraud, waste and abuse for a living. It’s going to be a tech story.”</p><p>Mr. Bisignano has held positions at several of Wall Street’s marquee firms, including Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/us/politics/frank-bisignano-social-security.html" title="">earned $100 million</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/25/business/ceo-pay-2017.html" title="">in 2017</a>, more than 2,000 times the average employee’s salary at his firm at the time, First Data Corporation, which later merged with Fiserv.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Bisignano declined to comment. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a statement: “Any American receiving Social Security benefits will continue to receive them. The sole mission of DOGE is to identify waste, fraud, and abuse only.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p><h2 id="link-86e6dce">‘I Screwed Up’</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/24/multimedia/dc-socialsecurity-mvgf/dc-socialsecurity-mvgf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/24/multimedia/dc-socialsecurity-mvgf/dc-socialsecurity-mvgf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/24/multimedia/dc-socialsecurity-mvgf/dc-socialsecurity-mvgf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A brown sign that says “Social Security” in white capital letters stands in front of barren trees on a lawn.

He said such a change would typically involve far more planning — a process that would normally take two years instead of two weeks, according to a person who participated in the meeting.</p><p>Mr. Dudek acknowledged in an interview with The New York Times on Friday that he had concerns about what would happen if the fast changes generated problems that impaired the agency.

It can take years to get up to speed on complex systems and policies, a key reason attrition is especially problematic at the agency, workers say.</p><p>Chris Delaney, an official for a federal workers’ union who also works as a claims specialist in Hudson, N.Y., said there was an “eerie cloud” looming over his office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“It seems like the people calling the shots have no clue what the field office is actually like, or they just want us all slaughtered,” he said.</p><p>Undergirding the suite of changes is Mr. Musk’s fixation on the idea that dead people and undocumented immigrants are fraudulently claiming benefits from Social Security. Experts say the relatively small amount of improper Social Security payments at — estimated at less than 1 percent of paid benefits — has little to do with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/upshot/social-security-fraud-claim-musk.html" title="">dead people</a> or undocumented immigrants, who in fact <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/business/social-security-undocumented-immigrants.html" title="">often pay taxes</a> into the system without ever claiming benefits, improving its fiscal health.</p><p>Nevertheless, Mr. Musk’s team has prioritized as one of its first projects marking people as dead in a crucial database if they are listed as being 120 years or older, along with other criteria. The team’s engineers are working with career civil servants on that effort, which is aimed at ridding the database of faulty records and is not expected to affect anyone receiving payments, according to people familiar with the work, who were not authorized to speak about it publicly.</p><p>Separately, Antonio Gracias, a private equity investor who is a close friend of Mr. Musk, and DOGE aides have also requested information about whether undocumented immigrants are receiving benefits, according to these people. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elon Musk has claimed that vast numbers of Americans are fraudulently drawing benefits from the Social Security Administration, an assertion experts say is demonstrably false.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>A federal judge castigated the Musk team’s fraud work in an order barring it from having access to sensitive personal information. “It has launched a search for the proverbial needle in the haystack, without any concrete knowledge that the needle is actually in the haystack,” wrote the judge, Ellen Lipton Hollander.</p><p>The order at one point last week prompted Mr. Dudek to threaten to shut down the system that undergirds the agency, though he later backed off. Members of Mr. Musk’s team no longer have access to sensitive agency data, he said.</p><p>Other initiatives by Mr. Dudek and DOGE are still proceeding. During the Biden administration, the agency said it would no longer withhold a full monthly benefit to recollect overpayments — which are often caused by agency errors — but instead hold back a maximum of 10 percent until the balance is repaid.
