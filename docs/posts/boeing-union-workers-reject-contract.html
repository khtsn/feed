The union represents about 33,000 workers, but it did not disclose how many voted on Wednesday.</p><p>“This wasn’t enough for our members,” said Jon Holden, president of District 751 of the union, which represents the vast majority of the workers. “They’ve spoken loudly and we’re going to go back to the table.”</p><p>The vote is a setback for Boeing’s new chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, who is trying to restore Boeing’s reputation and business, which he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/business/boeing-earnings-strike-vote.html" title="">described in detail earlier on Wednesday</a>. In remarks to workers and investors, Mr. Ortberg said Boeing needed to undergo “fundamental culture change” to stabilize the business and to improve execution.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Our leaders, from me on down, need to be closely integrated with our business and the people who are doing the design and production of our products,” he said. “We need to be on the factory floors, in the back shops and in our engineering labs. We need to know what’s going on, not only with our products, but with our people.”</p><p>Mr. Ortberg delivered that message alongside the company’s quarterly financial results, which included a loss of more than $6.1 billion. This month, Boeing also announced plans to cut its work force by about 10 percent, which amounts to 17,000 jobs. Boeing also recently disclosed plans to raise as much as $25 billion by selling debt or stock over the next three years as it tries to avoid a damaging downgrade to its credit rating.</p><p>The negotiations have been contentious. Workers overwhelmingly rejected an earlier contract offer that had been backed by union leaders and Boeing, resulting in the walkout on Sept. 13. Later that month, the company made what it described as its “best and final” offer. The company gave workers just days to approve or reject it, but leaders of the union never put it to a vote. Boeing eventually rescinded the offer, with talks breaking down this month.</p><p>The two sides arrived at the now rejected deal only after the Biden administration got involved. Last week, Julie Su, the acting labor secretary, flew to Seattle to meet with company executives and union officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Striking Boeing machinists marching outside the company’s Seattle Delivery Center after a rally on October 15.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">M.

It employs almost 150,000 people across the country — nearly half in Washington State — and is one of the nation’s largest exporters. The company also makes military jets, rockets, spacecraft and Air Force One.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Under the contract, workers would have received cumulative raises of nearly 40 percent over four years, a significant increase over the rejected offer and close to what the union initially sought. The offer included a $7,000 one-time bonus and additional contributions to retirement plans. It also would have preserved an incentive bonus program that the initial rejected offer would have replaced.</p><p>But the contract did not revive a defined-benefit pension plan that was frozen a decade ago — an important priority for many union members. Many workers have been furious over that loss for years, and some have said that they felt Boeing had bullied them into agreeing to the freezing of the pension. Workers have also been angry with the leadership of the union’s parent organization, which they say scheduled the vote in a way that supported approval of the offer.</p><p>On Wednesday afternoon, union members streamed in and out of the Angel of the Winds Arena in Everett, Wash., one of the voting locations and a short drive from a large Boeing factory. A handful held signs and handed out fliers urging others to reject the offer.</p><p>In interviews, several said they voted against the offer because they felt the union could hold out for better terms on wages, retirement, health coverage and other benefits. Some said they were frustrated over the lost pension, even if the odds of getting it restored were not strong.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“How do they expect to have anybody stay at the company if they don’t have some kind of a pension plan or better investments,” said Darryl Shore, who has worked at Boeing in different roles since 1989.</p><p>Mr. Shore said he grew up in the area and both his parents worked at Boeing, but that jobs at the company today don’t hold the same economic promise they did back then.</p><p>The rejection of the new contract comes as Boeing is trying to recover from a crisis that began when a panel fell off a 737 Max jet during an Alaska Airlines flight in January, reigniting concerns about the quality and safety of Boeing’s planes. Five years earlier, two fatal Max crashes led regulators worldwide to ground the plane for nearly two years.</p><p>After the January episode, the Federal Aviation Administration limited production of the Max, Boeing’s best-selling plane. The company has since increased inspections, added training for new hires, started to simplify procedures and limited tasks performed out of sequence.</p><p>The contract’s defeat is also bad news for the manufacturer’s many suppliers. Spirit AeroSystems, which makes the body of the 737 Max and has agreed to sell itself to Boeing, recently announced plans to furlough about 700 employees, starting next week, because of the strike.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
