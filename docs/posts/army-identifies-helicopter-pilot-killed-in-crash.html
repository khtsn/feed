Rebecca M. Lobach, 28, of Durham, N.C.</p><p>On Friday, the Army released the names of two male aviators who were killed in the crash, but in an extraordinary step, it did not identify Captain Lobach, who was the pilot of the helicopter, citing her family’s request for privacy.</p><p>The issue of Captain Lobach’s identity was particularly sensitive because President Trump has blamed diversity, without evidence, for the crash. Investigators are still trying to determine what caused the disaster.</p><p>On Saturday, however, the Lobach family issued a statement through the Army that described her achievements and qualifications. Captain Lobach was an R.O.T.C. graduate from the University of North Carolina and joined the Army in January 2019. She twice served as a platoon leader and company executive officer in the 12th Aviation Battalion at Fort Belvoir, Va. With more than 450 flight hours, she was certified as a pilot in command.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Army officials said on Friday that Captain Lobach was undergoing her annual evaluation flight, with Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Lloyd Eaves serving as her evaluator. Officer Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Md., and Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Ga., were also killed in the crash.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eric Schmitt is a national security correspondent for The Times, focusing on U.S. military affairs and counterterrorism issues overseas, topics he has reported on for more than three decades.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-schmitt">More about Eric Schmitt</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
