It’s a noisy, fast-paced job that for Mr. Cohen, a self-described “stress smoker,” has made it harder to quit.</p><p>“I’ve tried gum, patches, snacks,” Mr. Cohen, 35, said, taking a drag. “It’s not hard to stop — it’s hard to stay stopped.”</p><p>Cigarettes are notoriously difficult to kick: Even after one year of abstinence, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3723776/#:~:text=After%20one%20full%20year%20of,after%2030%20years%20of%20abstinence." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about half of smokers light up again</a>. Most people fail to quit cold turkey. Other approaches, including prescription medications and the nicotine gums and patches that Mr. Cohen tried, come with side effects or don’t satisfy cravings. A recent scientific review identified a little-known plant-based compound <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39231467/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called cytisine</a> as one of the more effective options. But while a pill version is used around the world to help people stop smoking, it is not available in the United States.</p><p>There is now a small biotech company running clinical trials in the United States in hopes of bringing it to a broader market. If it were approved, cytisine would become the first smoking cessation drug since 2006. While smoking rates have plummeted, tobacco use still causes <a href="https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/public-health-education/health-effects-tobacco-use#:~:text=Tobacco%20use%20has%20serious%20effects,than%20480%2C000%20deaths%20each%20year." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly half a million deaths</a> nationwide each year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Relapse rates are just so high, and we have evidence that cytisine helps,” said Jonathan Livingstone-Banks, a tobacco researcher at the University of Oxford and the lead author of the recent review.</p><h2 id="link-2c6907e0">The potential for cytisine</h2><p>Cytisine is found in the laburnum tree. During World War II, soldiers used the tree’s leaves as a tobacco substitute. The drug was later developed as a pill in Bulgaria in 1964. While cytisine has been used to treat <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104366182100284X" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nicotine addiction in Eastern Europe</a> for decades, it’s only more recently that the compound has been considered for smoking cessation in the rest of the world. It was approved in Canada in 2017, and in Britain last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cytisine, a compound found in the seeds of the laburnum tree, has been used for smoking cessation in Eastern Europe for decades.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">DeAgostini, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A 2023 analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials on cytisine found that the drug was <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.16399" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than twice</a> as effective as a placebo at helping people quit. The drug’s efficacy was similar to that of varenicline, another cessation medication best known by the brand name Chantix. And the review suggested that cytisine was more effective than nicotine replacement therapies like patches, said Omar De Santi, a toxicologist at the National Poison Center in Argentina who led the analysis.</p><p>For many years, cytisine received relatively little attention in the United States. But in 2006, a Swiss researcher published <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16908787/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a review of European studies</a> that suggested cytisine could be an inexpensive and effective quitting tool. The review excited tobacco experts, including Dr. Nancy A. Rigotti, a professor at Harvard Medical School who called it a “tobacco treatment hiding in plain sight” in a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMe1412313" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2014 editorial</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It’s out there, and it’s cheap to make,” said Dr. Rigotti, who directs the Tobacco Research and Treatment Center at Massachusetts General Hospital.</p><p>In recent years, a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanres/PIIS2213-2600(23)00184-4.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shortage of varenicline</a> has also driven greater interest in cytisine, as has a growing frustration among doctors and smokers about the existing treatment options.</p><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1924690/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nicotine patches and gums</a> can ease withdrawal symptoms like irritability but don’t curb cravings particularly well. The antidepressant bupropion helps with withdrawal, but some patients struggle with its side effects, which can include <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/quit-smoking/quit-smoking-medications/how-to-use-quit-smoking-medicines/how-to-use-bupropion-sr.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dizziness and difficulty sleeping</a>. Varenicline can be costly, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10520500/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not all health insurers</a> cover it. Therapy can help, especially in conjunction with other quitting aids, but few smokers use it.</p><p>“The products that have been approved don’t work very well in the real world,” said Mitch Zeller, a former Food and Drug Administration associate commissioner who led the agency’s tobacco division for nine years until 2022.</p><p>Cytisine, like varenicline, binds to the brain’s nicotine receptors to blunt the satisfaction of smoking, but with milder withdrawal symptoms than varenicline.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“That’s where cytisine really shines,” said Dr. James Davis, a physician and the director of the Duke Smoking Cessation Program.</p><p>The drug does have occasional side effects, including diarrhea, which led Mehmet Can Yalçın, a 25-year-old game developer, to stop using it after 12 days. Mr. Yalçın, who lives in Antalya, Turkey, said a doctor had prescribed it to help him wean off his two-pack-a-day habit.</p><p>Although he stopped taking the drug, he also hasn’t smoked in two months. “I just don’t have that craving anymore,” he said.</p><p>In <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37432430/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a clinical trial</a> funded by the biotech company, Achieve Life Sciences, and conducted in collaboration with Dr. Rigotti, researchers followed cigarette smokers who either took cytisine daily and received counseling or received a placebo. After six months, about 20 percent of patients taking cytisine weren’t smoking, compared with about 5 percent taking a placebo. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2818194" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Another trial</a> involving people who vaped also showed promising results. </p><p>Achieve Life Sciences had hoped to seek approval for cytisine as a nicotine cessation aid by December. But an F.D.A. request for more safety data has delayed that timeline by at least a year.</p><p>Tobacco experts said that cytisine was an encouraging prospect, but that it wouldn’t be a panacea.</p><p>“The act of quitting still requires willpower,” Dr. Davis said. “Medications won’t do it alone.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
