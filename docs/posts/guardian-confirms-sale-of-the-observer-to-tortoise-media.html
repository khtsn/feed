The announcement on Friday came shortly after journalists at the two news outlets <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/guardian-strike-observer.html" title="">waged a 48-hour strike</a>, calling the deal “rushed” and a risk to the journalism of both newspapers.</p><p>The Guardian’s parent company, which bought The Observer in 1993, did not disclose the sale price. But it said the Scott Trust, a 1.3 billion-pound ($1.7 billion) fund, would invest in Tortoise Media and become one of its largest shareholders. The trust will also have representatives on the company and editorial boards of Tortoise Media, which said it had raised £25 million to invest in The Observer.</p><p>“We knew we needed the right combination of resources and commitment to build a new platform for The Observer,” Ole Jacob Sunde, the chair of the Scott Trust, said in a statement. “It required an ally to be sufficiently funded, long-term in nature, and respect editorial independence and liberal values. I believe we have found this in Tortoise Media.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>When <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/business/dealbook/guardian-observer-sale-tortoise.html" title="">the proposed sale came to light in September</a>, it was a surprise to the papers’ journalists, who raised concerns about the ability of Tortoise Media, a six-year-old company that has not recorded a profit, to preserve the future of The Observer.</p><p>Amid pressure from the staff to reconsider the deal, the Scott Trust pushed to have some say in the editorial direction of The Observer after the sale. Journalists at both newspapers walked off the job on Wednesday and Thursday, hoping to delay the deal. It was the first strike in the newsroom in more than 50 years.</p><p>The sale of The Observer has also drawn criticism from former editors of the publication, and Alan Rusbridger, the former editor of The Guardian, as well as from some British authors, actors and other well-known figures.</p><p>“I recognize how unsettling this period has been for Observer staff,” Katharine Viner, the editor in chief of The Guardian, said in statement. “But we’re confident we have agreed the best possible way forward.”</p><p>Tortoise Media was founded in 2018 by James Harding, a former director of BBC News, and Matthew Barzun, a former U.S. ambassador to Britain. It focuses on what it calls “slow news,” emphasizing investigations rather than breaking news.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Before joining the BBC, Mr. Harding was editor of The Times of London, part of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp media conglomerate. He led The Times through the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/05/business/media/05iht-papers05.html" title="">newspaper’s transition into the digital era</a>, when advertising revenue was slumping and news outlets were moving their content behind paywalls.</p><p>But he left in 2012, while News Corp was embroiled in the aftermath of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/world/europe/washington-post-publisher-scandal.html" title="">phone hacking scandal</a> at another of its publications, apparently because he no longer had the support of Mr. Murdoch. “It has been made clear to me that News Corporation would like to appoint a new editor,” <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20701000" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said at the time</a>.</p><p>Tortoise Media’s recent investors include Standard Investments, an arm of the American conglomerate Standard Industries, and This Day, the philanthropic organization of Gary Lubner, who is also a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ca602c78-a0d8-4869-82b1-b8cb5fe722a1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">major donor to Britain’s Labour Party</a>.</p><p>Tortoise and The Observer will combine into one newsroom, the start-up said on Friday. It has previously said it would put The Observer’s online content behind a paywall, while retaining a print publication on Sundays.</p><p>“We are honored and excited at the prospect of working together to renew The Observer, a name that represents the best of liberal, pioneering journalism,” Mr. Harding said in a statement.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eshe Nelson is a reporter based in London, covering economics and business news for The New York Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eshe-nelson">More about Eshe Nelson</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
