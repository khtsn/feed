    <h1>Political Turmoil Adds to the Economic Woes of South Korea</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the third quarter, the country’s economy grew <a href="https://www.bok.or.kr/eng/bbs/E0000634/view.do?nttId=10088428&amp;searchCnd=1&amp;searchKwd=&amp;depth=400007&amp;pageUnit=10&amp;pageIndex=1&amp;programType=newsDataEng&amp;menuNo=400423&amp;oldMenuNo=400007" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">only 0.1 percent</a> from the previous three months, after shrinking by 0.2 percent in the second quarter.</p><p>In surveys of public opinion, dissatisfaction over Mr. Yoon’s handling of the economy has regularly ranked among the biggest complaints during his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/world/asia/south-korea-yoon-martial-law.html" title="">increasingly unpopular presidency</a>. On Friday, the head of Mr. Yoon’s own party <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/world/asia/south-korea-yoon-impeachment.html" title="">said</a> that he supported the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/04/world/asia/south-korea-impeachment-vote-president-yoon.html" title="">impeachment of the president</a>, in a vote scheduled for Saturday.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of the martial law decree, South Korean stocks and the country’s currency plunged, before recovering somewhat after a quick reversal by Mr. Yoon.</p><p>In the days since, South Korea’s finance minister, central bank governor and senior regulators have promised “unlimited” support to markets and pledged to hold “emergency” meetings every morning until conditions stabilize. In statements, they have said that investors should not be “overly anxious” and, on Friday, that market conditions were “generally stable.”</p><p>The credit ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor’s said the brief imposition of martial law was “very unexpected” for a country with the third-highest level of credit worthiness. It may take a while for investor confidence to return, the agency said, but it did not expect the decline in sentiment to warrant a change in rating in the short term.</p></div></div>
