The country’s stock market is one of the worst-performing in the world this year, its currency has weakened more against the U.S. dollar than other major Asian currencies and the economy has largely stagnated.</p><p>The election of Donald J. Trump, with his pledge of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/us/politics/trump-tariffs-global-trade.html" title="">across-the-board tariffs</a>, has added to the unease for South Korea’s major exporters, which underpin the economy. It is especially unsettling because South Korea now sells more to the United States than China for the first time in more than two decades, a consequence of Washington’s export controls limiting sales of advanced semiconductors and chip-making equipment to Chinese firms.</p><p>Officials at South Korea’s central bank <a href="https://www.bok.or.kr/eng/bbs/E0000634/view.do?nttId=10088272&amp;searchCnd=1&amp;searchKwd=&amp;depth2=400417&amp;depth3=400423&amp;depth=400423&amp;pageUnit=10&amp;pageIndex=1&amp;programType=newsDataEng&amp;menuNo=400423&amp;oldMenuNo=400423" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unexpectedly cut interest rates</a> last week, citing “heightened uncertainties surrounding growth and inflation, driven by the new U.S. administration’s policies.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In the third quarter, the country’s economy grew <a href="https://www.bok.or.kr/eng/bbs/E0000634/view.do?nttId=10088428&amp;searchCnd=1&amp;searchKwd=&amp;depth=400007&amp;pageUnit=10&amp;pageIndex=1&amp;programType=newsDataEng&amp;menuNo=400423&amp;oldMenuNo=400007" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">only 0.1 percent</a> from the previous three months, after shrinking by 0.2 percent in the second quarter.</p><p>In surveys of public opinion, dissatisfaction over Mr. Yoon’s handling of the economy has regularly ranked among the biggest complaints during his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/world/asia/south-korea-yoon-martial-law.html" title="">increasingly unpopular presidency</a>. On Friday, the head of Mr. Yoon’s own party <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/world/asia/south-korea-yoon-impeachment.html" title="">said</a> that he supported the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/04/world/asia/south-korea-impeachment-vote-president-yoon.html" title="">impeachment of the president</a>, in a vote scheduled for Saturday.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of the martial law decree, South Korean stocks and the country’s currency plunged, before recovering somewhat after a quick reversal by Mr. Yoon.</p><p>In the days since, South Korea’s finance minister, central bank governor and senior regulators have promised “unlimited” support to markets and pledged to hold “emergency” meetings every morning until conditions stabilize. In statements, they have said that investors should not be “overly anxious” and, on Friday, that market conditions were “generally stable.”</p><p>The credit ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor’s said the brief imposition of martial law was “very unexpected” for a country with the third-highest level of credit worthiness. It may take a while for investor confidence to return, the agency said, but it did not expect the decline in sentiment to warrant a change in rating in the short term.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Daisuke Wakabayashi is an Asia business correspondent for The Times based in Seoul, covering economic, corporate and geopolitical stories from the region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/daisuke-wakabayashi">More about Daisuke Wakabayashi</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
