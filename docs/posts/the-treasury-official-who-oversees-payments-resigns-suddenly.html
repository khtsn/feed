In the nearer term, that could disrupt supply chains and lead to product shortages, if importers choose not to pay the cost of the tariff. And in the longer run, companies may choose to pass the cost on to American consumers, raising prices and slowing the economy.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s desire to hit allies and competitors alike with tariffs over issues that have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-tariffs-colombia-canada-greenland.html" title="">little to do with trade</a> demonstrates the president’s willingness to use a powerful economic tool to fulfill his domestic policy agenda, particularly his focus on illegal immigration.</p><p>“Hopes that Trump’s tariffs threats were merely bluster and a bargaining tool are now crumbling under the harsh reality of his determination to deploy tariffs as a tool to shift other countries’ policies to his liking,” said Eswar Prasad, a trade policy professor at Cornell University.</p><p>Mr. Trump said in November that he would put tariffs of 25 percent on Canada and Mexico and 10 percent on China, in an effort to halt the flow of migrants and drugs, particularly fentanyl, into the United States.</p><p>The threat set off a scramble from Canadian and Mexican officials, who tried to persuade the administration to hold off on tariffs by engaging in last-minute talks with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and detailing the efforts they were making to police the border.</p><p>Auto and energy companies have also been pushing the White House and the administration hard not to apply tariffs.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s advisers have been weighing different scenarios, like tariffs that would apply to specific sectors, such as steel and aluminum, or levies that would be announced but not go into effect for several months, according to people familiar with the planning.</p><p>President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico told reporters on Friday that the Mexican government had been working for months on a plan to react to possible tariffs. “We are prepared for any scenario,” she said before Ms. Leavitt’s briefing, adding that Mexico was “doing everything in our power” to prevent tariffs. “What do we want? That dialogue with respect prevail.”</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada reiterated on Friday before the briefing that his government still did not know if the tariffs would come into place on Saturday and what precisely they would cover.</p><p>“If the president does choose to implement any tariffs against Canada, we’re ready with a response — a purposeful, forceful but reasonable, immediate response,” Mr. Trudeau told reporters. “It’s not what we want. But if he moves forward, we will also act.”</p><p>At both borders, the number of illegal crossings has dropped sharply.</p><p>The number of unauthorized crossings at the southern border in December 2023 reached nearly 250,000, overwhelming the Border Patrol and causing the government to shut down a port of entry. At the northern border, the flow of migrants crossing illegally skyrocketed during the 2024 fiscal year. During that time, more than 23,000 arrests were made of migrants crossing illegally — two years before that figure was around 2,000.</p><p>The situation at the border has changed since then.</p><p>In December, agents made roughly 47,000 arrests at the southern border and 510 at the northern border.</p><p>Speaking from the Oval Office on Thursday, Mr. Trump suggested he was ready to cut off imports from Canada and Mexico, two of America’s closest allies.</p><p>“We’ll be announcing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a number of reasons,” he said. “I’ll be putting the tariff of 25 percent on Canada, and separately, 25 percent on Mexico, and we’ll really have to do that.”</p><p>“We don’t need what they have,” Mr. Trump said. He added that tariff rates could increase over time and suggested that the tariffs might not apply to oil imports, a decision that could avoid a spike in gas prices.</p><p>While the United States is the world’s largest oil producer, refineries need to mix the lighter crude produced in domestic fields with heavier oil from places like Canada to make fuels like gasoline and diesel. Roughly 60 percent of the oil that the United States imports comes from Canada, and about 7 percent comes from Mexico.</p><p>According to Tom Kloza, the global head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service, if fuel producers respond to the tariffs by cutting production, gasoline prices in the Midwest could climb 15 to 20 cents a gallon, with more muted effects in other parts of the country.</p><p>The potential economic implications from tariffs are also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/politics/fed-tariffs-inflation-canada-mexico.html" title="">complicating matters for the Federal Reserve</a>, which is still trying to wrestle inflation down to its 2 percent target. The Fed this week held interest rates steady, after a series of cuts, amid persistent inflation and questions about how the tariffs would play out.</p><p>The economic fallout from the tariffs would depend on how they were structured, but the ripple effects could be broad. Canada, Mexico and the United States have been governed by a trade agreement for more than 30 years, and many industries, from automobiles and apparel to agriculture, have grown highly integrated across North America.</p><p>Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the tariffs would be “very costly” for U.S. businesses.</p><p>U.S. factories rely on inputs from both countries, including minerals and timber from Canada and auto parts from Mexico. The tariffs would also go against efforts that U.S. companies have made in recent years to move out of China, at the urging of the Trump and Biden administrations.</p><p>According to economists at S&amp;P Global, the auto and electric equipment sectors in Mexico would be most exposed to disruption if tariffs were enacted, as would mineral processing in Canada. In the United States, the largest risks would be to the farming, fishing, metals and auto sectors.</p><p>Mr. Trump has highlighted the ability of tariffs to protect domestic manufacturers. But on balance, most economists expect fresh trade barriers to raise prices for U.S. businesses and households, which could lead to a temporary burst of higher inflation. Whether that escalates into a more pernicious problem will depend on whether Americans’ expectations about future inflation start to shift higher in a meaningful way.</p><p>Over time, economists also worry about the effects on growth, warning that trade tensions are likely to lead to less investment, more subdued business activity and slower growth.</p><p>Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, estimates that a 25 percent tariff on all Canadian and Mexican imported goods — paired with a 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports — would lead to a permanent 0.8 percent bump in the price level, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index. That translates to roughly $1,300 for households on average. Those estimates assume that the targeted countries enact retaliatory measures and that the Federal Reserve does not take action by adjusting interest rates.</p><p>Mr. Tedeschi expects this to eventually shave 0.2 percent off gross domestic product once inflation is taken into account.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s top economic advisers have refuted the idea that the tariffs would fuel inflation. In the press briefing, Ms. Leavitt said inflation had remained subdued in Mr. Trump’s first term, despite tariffs being imposed. And she said the president was undertaking other policies that would lower inflation, like passing tax cuts and encouraging energy production.</p><p>At his confirmation hearing this month, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed concerns from Democrats about Mr. Trump’s trade policy, suggesting that exporters from countries such as China would lower their prices in the face of higher U.S. tariffs. Mr. Bessent said last year that it would be prudent if any tariffs were phased in so that any associated “price adjustment” could be absorbed gradually by the economy.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s pick to be commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, also embraced tariffs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/business/economy/lutnick-trump-tariffs-china.html" title="">at his confirmation hearing</a> and pushed back against the notion that they would fuel inflation. He suggested that Canada and Mexico might be able to avoid the tariffs that Mr. Trump was dangling if they closed their borders to fentanyl.</p><p>Mr. Lutnick indicated that he believed “across the board” tariffs on countries would be most effective, arguing that China should face the highest rates and that Europe, Japan and South Korea were also treating American industries unfairly.</p><p>“We need that disrespect to end, and I think tariffs are a way to create reciprocity, to be treated fairly, to be treated appropriately,” Mr. Lutnick said.</p><p>Hamed Aleaziz<!-- -->, <!-- -->Vjosa Isai<!-- --> and <!-- -->Emiliano Rodríguez Mega<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="26" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMDUxNWY5MWItMzAyYy01OTFjLWIwZjctOTM2MTExNjQyNWQ3"><div id="0515f91b-302c-591c-b0f7-9361116425d7" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/30/us/president-trump-news#0515f91b-302c-591c-b0f7-9361116425d7"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ian-austen"><img alt="Ian Austen" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/18/reader-center/author-ian-austen/author-ian-austen-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/18/reader-center/author-ian-austen/author-ian-austen-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/18/reader-center/author-ian-austen/author-ian-austen-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-31T19:18:47.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 31, 2025, 2:18 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Drew Dilkens, the mayor of Windsor, Ontario, the auto-making city directly across the river from Detroit, said that the economic effects of the 25 percent tariffs President Trump intends to impose tomorrow on Canadian goods would be “catastrophic” for his community.

That change, announced during the Biden administration, broadened the law’s scope to recognize harassment or exclusion based on sexual orientation and gender identity to be a form of discrimination.</p><div><p>The revised guidance issued Friday instructed educators to once again adopt new standards for enforcing codes against sexual violence and harassment on campus, a process they have had to undertake every four years as rules have whipsawed back and forth under the last four administrations.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/us/politics/betsy-devos-title-ix.html" title="">old rules</a>, set in 2018, eased the standards by which the department assessed schools’ liability in sexual misconduct cases, giving schools room to follow different evidentiary standards and appeals processes in investigations. They also required schools to hold live hearings in which accusers and students accused of sexual assault could cross-examine one another, including through a lawyer.</p><p>In a break from recent changes surrounding the law, formally known as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/22/sports/what-is-title-ix.html" title="">Title IX of the Education Amendments Act</a>, the letter sent Friday stated that the changes in its implementations could begin immediately, after a federal judge in Kentucky <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/politics/biden-title-ix-ruling.html" title="">blocked</a> the Biden administration’s revisions from taking effect. That ruling was largely based on the Biden-era rules’ increased protections for transgender students, which the judge found to be unconstitutional.</p><p>The letter also leaned on Mr. Trump’s executive authority to justify the immediate return to the old standards, circumventing the more standard practice of proposing new regulations through a lengthy federal rule-making process. It stated that the employees in the Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights, which enforces federal law across schools receiving federal funding, essentially answer to the president.</p><p>“As a constitutional matter, the president’s interpretation of the law governs because he alone controls and supervises subordinate officers who exercise discretionary executive power on his behalf,” it said. “That unified control extends to Ed and OCR; therefore, Title IX must be enforced consistent with President Trump’s order.”</p><p>Similar changes put forward under former President Barack Obama were also made informally through “dear colleague” letters like the one released on Friday, but informal guidance does not traditionally carry the force of law and can be easily overturned.</p><p>Students’ rights groups focused on due process celebrated the development as a restoration of fair standards for those accused of serious offenses.</p><p>“The return to the 2020 rules ensures that all students — whether they are the accused or the accuser — will receive fair treatment and important procedural safeguards,” Tyler Coward, a lead counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said in a statement. “That includes the right of both parties to have lawyers present during hearings, the right for both attorneys to cross-examine the other party and witnesses, and the right to receive all of the evidence in the institution’s possession.”</p><p>Critics of the rules, dating to Mr. Trump’s first term, have said the requirements for live hearings force victims to relive the trauma of sexual violence and give the schools they attend more room to ignore or informally resolve many serious infractions.</p><p>“This is an incredibly disappointing decision that will leave many survivors of sexual violence, LGBTQ+ students, and pregnant and parenting students without the accommodations critical to their ability to learn and attend class safely,” Emma Grasso Levine, a senior manager at Know Your IX, said in a statement. “Schools must step up to protect students in the absence of adequate federal guidance.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="22" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYzYwNzRhMzEtZWViMy01ODQ5LTg2NzAtYTE5ZDk1ZGY3YTU1"><div id="c6074a31-eeb3-5849-8670-a19d95df7a55" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/30/us/president-trump-news#c6074a31-eeb3-5849-8670-a19d95df7a55"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matina-stevis-gridneff"><img alt="Matina Stevis-Gridneff" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/reader-center/author-matina-stevis-gridneff/author-matina-stevis-gridneff-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/reader-center/author-matina-stevis-gridneff/author-matina-stevis-gridneff-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/reader-center/author-matina-stevis-gridneff/author-matina-stevis-gridneff-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-31T18:56:00.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 31, 2025, 1:56 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Canada’s foreign and public safety ministers are in Washington trying to convince Trump officials and allies that the country has taken action to secure the northern border and shouldn’t be hit with tariffs.

Kennedy Jr. told lawmakers in responses to questions released on Friday that he would divest his interest in litigation against a major HPV vaccine maker and would sign over the financial stake to an adult son.</p><p>He also disclosed he had reached at least one settlement agreement with a company or individual that had accused him of “misconduct or inappropriate behavior.” No other details were provided.</p><div><p>At his two Senate confirmation hearings this week, several Democrats assailed his legal work, which included referrals for lawsuits against a vaccine maker. In the <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/709a5b13ec222dae/ab3b8100-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ethics agreement</a> he provided to senators as part of the process to become the nation’s health secretary, he stated that he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/rfk-hpv-vaccine-merck.html" title="">keep his financial stake</a> in cases that he referred to Wisner Baum, a personal injury law firm based in Los Angeles.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy told senators on Thursday that he had sent hundreds of cases to the firm for lawsuits against the drug maker Merck claiming injuries from the company’s Gardasil vaccine, which is given to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/health/hpv-vaccine-rfk.html" title="">prevent cervical cancer</a> that can be caused by the human papillomavirus, or HPV.</p><p>After fiery grilling from senators, Mr. Kennedy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/health/rfk-jr-hpv-vaccine-lawsuits-fees.html" title="">said on Thursday that he</a> would relinquish his financial stake, but did not elaborate.</p><p>On Friday, he provided additional details in his written answers to the senators’ questions: “An amendment to my ethics agreement is in process,” Mr. Kennedy wrote. “It provides that I will divest my interest in any such litigation via an assignment to my nondependent, adult son.”</p><p>Mr. Kennedy has more than one adult son, though one of them, Conor Kennedy, is a lawyer at Wisner Baum, the firm trying the cases. The younger Kennedy’s <a href="https://www.wisnerbaum.com/attorneys/conor-kennedy/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">biography on the firm website</a> states that he works on litigation involving claims that the drug Zantac caused cancer and also on cases against opioid makers that claim widespread malfeasance underlying the epidemic of opioid-related deaths.</p><p>The first of many lawsuits claiming that young people were harmed by the HPV vaccine is on trial in Los Angeles Superior Court. Mr. Kennedy has used social media to promote the claims; in 2022 <a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1557363890257887232" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he posted a video</a> to recruit additional plaintiffs. Merck said the allegations have no merit.</p><p>In that California trial, Wisner Baum lawyers are representing a young plaintiff who claims she suffered from a <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-pots" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blood circulation disorder</a> after receiving the HPV vaccine.</p><p>Conor Kennedy and Wisner Baum were not available for comment. Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for the elder Mr. Kennedy, did not respond immediately to requests for comment, including one asking which son would be granted the stake in litigation.</p><p>The value of Mr. Kennedy’s interest in the litigation is not known. In his initial ethics agreement, he stated, “I’m entitled to receive 10 percent of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm.” He wrote that he is not a lawyer in any of the cases.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat of Massachusetts, who fiercely criticized the arrangement during the Senate finance hearing, said on Friday that she wanted to see the amended ethics agreement before a vote.</p><p>She noted that she was concerned about Mr. Kennedy “leaving the window open to profit from other antivax lawsuits.”</p><p>If confirmed as secretary of the Health and Human Services Department, Mr. Kennedy would have far-reaching authority over decisions involving drug approvals, safety actions, and funding and guidance for the nation’s pharmaceutical and health care companies and insurers.</p><p>Ms. Warren again on Friday demanded that he pledge to refrain from profiting from litigation against any entity regulated by the department for four years after leaving the post.</p><p>“It’s also critical that the revised ethics agreement ensures that he cannot use his role as health secretary to open the floodgates to more anti-vaccine litigation and then cash in after he leaves office,” Ms. Warren wrote in a statement.</p><p>After this week’s back-to-back confirmation hearings, it will be up to the Senate Finance Committee to decide whether to send Mr. Kennedy’s nomination to the floor for a full vote. One influential Republican and committee member, Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, is clearly agonizing over how to vote. A committee vote is likely next week.</p><p>If Mr. Cassidy, who is a physician, votes against Mr. Kennedy and no Democrats vote for him, Republican leaders might have to use a procedural tactic to send the nomination forward. Other Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor and the former Republican leader, also seem uneasy with Mr. Kennedy. In a closely divided Senate, Mr. Kennedy can afford to lose only three votes if he is to win final confirmation.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer and part of a team of lawyers who won a $289 million judgment against the agricultural giant Monsanto, has spoken in the past about his belief that change cannot be made through legislation, but by legal court challenge.</p><p>“You can’t do it through Congress, but you can do it by generating enough really high quality, good quality science that so that the attorneys can come in and do it and it’s the market fixing the problem rather than government,” he said on a podcast during his 2024 presidential campaign.</p><p>Ethics rules bar government officials from personally benefiting from their decisions and prohibit certain sharing of wealth with a spouse or a minor child. No such prohibition extends to adult children in those laws and regulations.</p><p>Democrats expect to ask follow-up questions to get clarification on a small number of Mr. Kennedy’s answers, according to two Democratic aides.</p><p>For instance, in his response about the settlement involving inappropriate behavior, Mr. Kennedy did not disclose the names of anyone involved in the settlement or settlements. Mr. Kennedy will most likely be pressed for additional details.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/12/us/politics/kennedy-sexual-assault-accusation.html" title="">accused of sexual harassment</a> and assault in the 1990s by Eliza Cooney, who was hired as a part-time babysitter by his family and worked with him when he taught at Pace University. At Thursday’s hearing before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, asked Mr. Kennedy about the incident.</p><p>“When you were confronted about this accusation, you said you were, quote, not a church boy, and that you, quote, have so many skeletons in my closet. You then texted Miss Cooney an apology and indicated you had no memory of what you described,” Ms. Murray said, asking pointedly whether he had made sexual advances.</p><p>“No, I did not,” Mr. Kennedy said. He added that the account had been debunked. Ms. Murray asked why he had apologized. “I apologized for something else,” he replied.</p><p>Ms. Murray pressed on, asking Mr. Kennedy if there were “any other instances where you have made sexual advances toward an individual without their consent? Just yes or no.”</p><p>“No,&#34; Mr. Kennedy replied.</p><p>In the answers he submitted on Friday, he did not specify the type of settlement he had reached, or the nature of the “misconduct or inappropriate behavior” of which he was accused. In an email statement to The Times on Friday, Ms. Murray recalled the exchange over the babysitter, and said that Mr. Kennedy was “patently unfit” to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p>“His answers to the finance committee are deeply troubling — the American people deserve answers, and senators must have them before a vote is held on his nomination,” the statement said.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="16" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzA3ZTlhMGExLWYzODQtNTVkNS1iYzM0LTliMDAzNTQ5NTZiYg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/30/us/president-trump-news#a-trump-envoy-will-meet-venezuelas-maduro-and-rubio-heads-to-the-panama-canal" data-source-id="100000009962325"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-crowley"><img alt="Michael Crowley" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/reader-center/author-michael-crowley/author-michael-crowley-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/reader-center/author-michael-crowley/author-michael-crowley-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/reader-center/author-michael-crowley/author-michael-crowley-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-31T17:18:16.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 31, 2025, 12:18 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela in Caracas early this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jesus Vargas/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>President Trump is sending an envoy to Venezuela to meet with the country’s autocratic leader, President Nicolás Maduro, a senior State Department official said, in one of the highest-level contacts between the United States and the Latin American strongman in years.</p><p>Richard Grenell, Mr. Trump’s envoy for special missions, intends to tell Mr. Maduro “to take back all of the Venezuelan criminals and gang members that have been exported to United States, and to do so unequivocally and without condition,” Mauricio Claver-Carone, Mr. Trump’s special envoy for Latin America, told reporters in a briefing call. He confirmed an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-presidency-news-01-31-25#cm6ktc2j400003b6n2hyco1d0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earlier CNN report</a> about the visit.</p><div><p>Mr. Claver-Carone added that Mr. Grenell, who the White House said arrived in Venezuela on Friday, also intends to demand that “American hostages that are being held in Venezuela” must be released “immediately.” He said Mr. Grenell would not be offering Maduro any inducements, adding that “we don’t need Venezuelan oil.”</p><p>Mr. Grenell’s visit comes despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/world/americas/biden-bounty-nicolas-maduro.html" title="">a $25 million bounty</a> for information leading to the arrest of the Venezuelan leader, a reward increased by the Biden administration from a $15 million bounty imposed by the Trump administration in 2020. Senior Biden officials also met with Mr. Maduro in 2022 to negotiate the release of Americans wrongfully imprisoned in Venezuela.</p><p>The briefing by Mr. Claver-Carone came ahead of Marco Rubio’s first foreign trip as secretary of state, a swing through several Latin American countries that begins on Saturday. </p><p>Mr. Claver-Carone added that Mr. Grenell’s trip did not reflect any change in Mr. Rubio’s longtime hard-line position toward Venezuela; his support for Mr. Maduro’s political opposition, which has been suppressed; or the need for “democratic change in Venezuela.”</p><p>Even before the news of Mr. Grenell’s trip to Latin America, analysts predicted tensions between the broadly-defined diplomatic role of Mr. Grenell, who works out of the White House, and Mr. Rubio’s work as secretary of state.</p><p>Mr. Rubio’s planned stops include Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic.

Canada and Mexico together account for 30 percent of U.S. trade. Many industries could be saddled with extra costs, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/world/canada/trump-tariffs-windsor-autos.html" title="">the vast auto operations</a> that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/business/general-motors-trump-mexico-canada-tariffs.html" title="">straddle</a> the U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada.</p><p>Mr. Trump could withdraw his threat or reduce the tariff if he decides Canada and Mexico are doing more to address his complaints, Howard Lutnick, the president’s nominee to lead the Commerce Department, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-commerce-chief-pick-lutnick-says-he-prefers-across-the-board-tariffs-by-2025-01-29/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested on Wednesday</a>.</p><p>With the tariff deadline near, some data shows higher freight volumes on road and rail, but the increases are not especially large, and transportation experts say rail and trucking companies have the capacity to cope. The situation, they said, is quite different from 2021 and 2022, when a deluge of imports overwhelmed supply chains, causing shipping costs to skyrocket and helping fuel a rapid acceleration of inflation.</p><p>“The industry’s probably never been in a better spot to deal with significant changes in the marketplace,” said Scott Shannon, vice president of North America cross-border at C.H. Robinson, a freight forwarder.</p><p>Larry Gross, president of Gross Transportation Consulting, said the transportation of shipping containers by rail was up 10 percent in the first four weeks of the year across North America compared with the same period in 2024. But while efforts to bring in goods before tariffs very likely contributed to the increase, he said, other factors also played a role. A big one was a desire to get shipments in before a possible strike at the East and Gulf Coast ports that could have started in mid-January <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/business/port-strike-labor-deal.html" title="">but was averted</a>.</p><p>“Every system has its limitations,” Mr. Gross said, “But the network is far better positioned today than it was at the beginning of the post-pandemic surge.” He said regulatory data that show how many trains are not running because they lack crews or locomotives were not showing any warning signs.</p><p>And Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, noted that storing inventory has significant costs — financing and paying for warehouse space — that may deter companies from accelerating their imports.</p><p>The U.S. also imports huge amounts of goods from China. Mr. Trump said he was going to impose 10 percent tariffs on Chinese goods on Saturday.</p><p>Imports from China arrive primarily through the ports. And while the volume of containers coming through U.S. ports has been strong in recent months, the ports — and trucks and railways that move cargo inland — have not had problems handling recent volumes.</p><p>Some businesses are concerned that applying tariffs to goods that currently lack them may slow customs processing at the Mexican and Canadian borders and cause delays. But Adam Lewis, a co-founder and the president of Clearit, an online customs broker, said he did not expect applying new tariffs to be difficult for the brokers.</p><p>While updating the brokers’ software may take a short while, he said, any new tasks relating to tariffs could be done manually without much trouble. “It’s pretty much business as usual,” Mr. Lewis said.</p><p>But there may be delays if U.S. Customs and Border Protection increases its scrutiny to ensure that businesses are complying. The agency did not comment.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNjE0ODA0MDItZWVjYS01NTEyLTljZmYtZWNhZDFmY2U2OGI4"><div id="61480402-eeca-5512-9cff-ecad1fce68b8" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/30/us/president-trump-news#61480402-eeca-5512-9cff-ecad1fce68b8"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/vjosa-isai"><img alt="Vjosa Isai" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/08/reader-center/author-vjosa-isai/author-vjosa-isai-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/08/reader-center/author-vjosa-isai/author-vjosa-isai-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/08/reader-center/author-vjosa-isai/author-vjosa-isai-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-31T15:49:38.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 31, 2025, 10:49 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada reiterated that his government still did not know if the 25 percent tariffs that President Trump has threatened to impose would come into place tomorrow and what precisely they would cover.</p><p>“If the president does choose to implement any tariffs against Canada, we’re ready with a response — a purposeful, forceful but reasonable, immediate response,” Trudeau told reporters. “It’s not what we want.

But employees have been informed over the years that it is illegal for them to take a second job while working for the federal government, raising questions about whether the government can deliver on that offer.</p><p>It also came after President Trump, in public comments, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/politics/trump-plane-crash-dei-faa-diversity.html" title="">blamed efforts to diversify</a> the air traffic controller work force as a contributor to the crash, saying hiring standards had been too lax. He provided no evidence for his assertions about air traffic controllers, a field plagued for years by staffing shortages.</p><p>A wide array of federal workers, including at the Homeland Security Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Justice Department, said they had received the email. But its tone and timing hit hard at the F.A.A., current and former employees said, given its proximity to the fatal air crash that may have stemmed in part from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/business/dc-plane-helicopter-crash-cause.html" title="">reduced staffing</a>.</p><p>The email from the Office of Personnel Management, a follow-up to one from earlier in the week in which the agency offered federal workers about eight months of continued pay if they agreed by Feb. 6 to leave their jobs, was reviewed by The Times. Four people with direct knowledge of the email confirmed that the agency’s workers had received it Thursday evening.</p><p>In a statement, Nick Daniels, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents air traffic controllers, said that while it was “not yet clear” how the resignation program would affect the union’s workers, it was “concerned” about the impact of losing “experienced aviation safety personnel during a universally recognized air traffic controller staffing shortage.”</p><p>An F.A.A. spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Emily Steel<!-- --> contributing reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="10" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2EzMzA1NGVmLWM5Y2QtNTQzOC04YTJiLWNkNzBjMWFkNjMyYw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/30/us/president-trump-news#the-treasury-official-who-oversees-payments-resigns-suddenly" data-source-id="100000009962097"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/andrew-duehren"><img alt="Andrew Duehren" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/06/reader-center/author-andrew-duehren/author-andrew-duehren-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/06/reader-center/author-andrew-duehren/author-andrew-duehren-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/06/reader-center/author-andrew-duehren/author-andrew-duehren-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/theodore-schleifer"><img alt="Theodore Schleifer" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/04/reader-center/author-teddy-schleifer/author-teddy-schleifer-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/04/reader-center/author-teddy-schleifer/author-teddy-schleifer-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/04/reader-center/author-teddy-schleifer/author-teddy-schleifer-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-31T15:22:09.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 31, 2025, 10:22 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>David Lebryk served as the acting secretary for a few days before Scott Bessent’s confirmation.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bill O&#39;Leary/The Washington Post, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The Treasury Department official who oversees the government’s vast payment system abruptly retired on Friday, according to an email viewed by The New York Times, after Elon Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-administration.html" title="">deployed engineers to the agency</a> to find a way to shut off funds to various projects.</p><p>David Lebryk was the top career official at the Treasury Department, and served as the acting secretary for a few days before Scott Bessent’s confirmation.

Bush predicted that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/13/nyregion/crash-flight-587-overview-260-jet-die-queens-crash-6-9-missing-12-homes-burn-us.html" title="">“resilient and strong and courageous people”</a> of New York would get through the tragedy. In 2009, after a Colgan Air plane crashed near Buffalo, President Barack Obama said that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcSaCSDVH-Q" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“tragic events such as these remind us of the fragility of life.”</a></p><div><p>And then there was President Trump. In the wake of this week’s midair collision near Washington, Mr. Trump was more than happy to jump to conclusions and pull the country apart rather than together. After declaring it to be an “hour of anguish for our nation,” Mr. Trump just five minutes later let anguish give way to aggression as he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/politics/trump-plane-crash-dei-faa-diversity.html" title="">blamed diversity policies</a> promoted by Mr. Obama and former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for the crash, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/31/us/dc-plane-crash" title="">which killed 67 people</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump has never been like other presidents. He does not follow many of the rituals and traditions of his office. He practices the politics of division rather than unity. Where past presidents have sought to project a comforting, paternal presence for a stricken nation in moments of crisis, Mr. Trump’s instinct is to move quickly from grief to grievance. He has long demonstrated that he is more comfortable as the blamer in chief than consoler in chief.</p><p>His decision to use the bully pulpit of the White House on Thursday to assign responsibility for the crash to his political rivals by name without offering a shred of evidence was, even for Mr. Trump, a striking performance. And it was no off-the-cuff comment. He followed up by signing an order directing a review of “problematic and likely illegal decisions” by Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>While Mr. Trump said there would be a “systemic and comprehensive investigation” of this week’s crash, he did not wait to offer the conclusions of his own rather less methodical inquiry.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>“I put safety first,” Mr. Trump told reporters in his first visit to the briefing room of his second term. “Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first. And they put politics at a level that nobody’s ever seen because this was the lowest level. Their policy was horrible and their politics was even worse.”</p><p>The Democratic presidents, he said, made “a big push to put diversity into the F.A.A.’s program,” leading to Wednesday night’s disaster over the Potomac River. Never mind that the “problematic” hiring policy language he read had also been in place during his own administration and that he could not say whether it had any connection to the crash.</p><p>It was not the first time Mr. Trump has exhibited what even his own former aides have called an “empathy gap.” Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, with thousands of Americans dying every day at its peak, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-grieving.html" title="">rarely paused long enough to dwell on the human toll</a> and never sponsored any memorial to the fallen. Instead, he focused his public messages on finding others to fault, whether it be China, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/us/politics/trump-obama.html" title="">Mr. Obama</a>, Democratic governors, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-who-funding.html" title="">World Health Organization</a>, federal regulators or his own <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/us/politics/trump-cdc-covid-vaccine.html" title="">scientific advisers</a>.</p><p>He has responded similarly to natural disasters by going on the attack. Just this month, Mr. Trump reacted to the devastating wildfires in greater Los Angeles by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/us/trump-newsom-california-fires.html" title="">blasting Gov. Gavin Newsom</a> of California, calling him “Newscum.”</p><p>After Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in 2017, he engaged in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/30/us/politics/trump-puerto-rico-mayor.html" title="">a war of words with San Juan’s mayor</a> and, when he finally visited the island, memorably tossed paper towels to people who had been left without food, water or power. Angry at criticism of his handling of the calamity, he later suggested to aides that the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/14/us/politics/trump-greenland.html" title="">sell or trade away Puerto Rico</a>.</p><p>“Trump doesn’t lead with empathy,” said Olivia Troye, who served on the White House Covid task force staff before later publicly criticizing the president’s management of the pandemic. “He exploits tragedy for whatever political grievance he’s peddling at the moment, never offering the comfort or stability a president should.”</p><p>The exception has been if the victims of a tragedy buttress a political argument he has been making. At <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/trump-signs-laken-riley-act.html" title="">a ceremony this week to sign a bill</a> cracking down on unauthorized immigrants charged with certain crimes, he expressed compassion for relatives of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old Georgia nursing student killed last year by a migrant from Venezuela who had crossed into the United States illegally.</p><p>Mr. Trump often moves to place any crisis into his own political or ideological narrative, regardless of the facts. He tied the California fires to wrongheaded environmental and water policies, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/climate/trump-california-fire-tweets.html" title="">assertions that experts disputed</a>. After the New Year’s Day terrorist attack on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/us/politics/trump-new-orleans.html" title="">blamed immigration</a>, even though the attacker was a U.S. citizen born in Texas.</p><p>This week, after American Airlines Flight 5342 collided with an Army Black Hawk helicopter over Reagan National Airport, Mr. Trump went straight to diversity policies, with no evident basis. The problem, he said, was that candidates for air traffic controller jobs were rejected because the work force was “too white” while people with serious mental or physical disabilities were hired.</p><p>In addition to Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden, two of Mr. Trump’s longtime favorite targets, the president singled out Pete Buttigieg, who served as Mr. Biden’s transportation secretary, saying that “he’s a disaster.” Mr. Buttigieg, as it happens, is considered a possible Democratic candidate for president in 2028.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>This week, after American Airlines Flight 5342 collided with an Army Black Hawk helicopter over Reagan National Airport, Mr. Trump went straight to diversity policies, with no evident basis. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Trump’s instant focus on diversity programs generated outrage among Democrats. “Listen, it’s one thing for internet pundits to spew off conspiracies,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on the Senate floor not long afterward. “It’s another for the president of the United States to throw out idle speculation as bodies are still being recovered and families are still being notified. It just turns your stomach.”</p><p>Mr. Buttigieg pushed back on social media. “Despicable,” <a href="https://x.com/PeteButtigieg/status/1885013865676562491" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he wrote</a>. “As families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying. We put safety first, drove down close calls, grew Air Traffic Control, and had zero commercial airline crash fatalities out of millions of flights on our watch.”</p><p>Mr. Buttigieg and other Democrats pointed out that Mr. Trump had just fired the members of an aviation security advisory group, although there was no indication that the move had contributed to this week’s crash. “Time for the president to show actual leadership and explain what he will do to prevent this from happening again,” Mr. Buttigieg wrote.</p><p>In this opening chapter of his return to power, Mr. Trump seems fixated on diversity programs more than ever. Other than immigration, he has made it perhaps the central villain of his second term. Among his first acts was to order <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/trump-dei-diversity-officials-orders.html" title="">the elimination of diversity, equity and inclusion programs</a> throughout the federal government and a review of federal grants and loans to weed out any that promote diversity.</p><p>Recognizing the writing on the wall, many states, localities, universities and private companies are now scrapping their diversity programs, either to curry favor with the new administration or to preserve their federal financing. Mr. Trump and his allies have successfully made the acronym D.E.I. politically radioactive.</p><p>As with so much else in this Trump 2.0 era, the road to Mr. Trump’s broadsides against the Federal Aviation Administration’s leadership and policies may lead back to Elon Musk, the president’s billionaire patron who has been given wide latitude to restructure government in the new administration.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Michael Whitaker, the former administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, resigned the day President Trump took office.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Musk has long quarreled with the F.A.A., which has hit his SpaceX rocket company with fines for safety lapses and sought to delay a launch. Last fall, he called for <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1836182108412481871" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“radical reform at the F.A.A.”</a> and a week later he reposted a picture of Michael Whitaker, the agency administrator, with the caption, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1838978117072805999?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1838978117072805999%7Ctwgr%5Ec8554f849de1be4c103b6861fa4171cad2206859%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.space.com%2Fspacex-elon-musk-faa-administrator-resign" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“He needs to resign.”</a> Mr. Whitaker <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/politics/faa-administrator-resigns.html" title="">did just that</a> the day Mr. Trump took office last week, and the new president appointed an acting successor on Thursday.</p><p>While Mr. Trump said there would be a “systemic and comprehensive investigation” of this week’s crash, he did not wait to offer the conclusions of his own rather less methodical inquiry. He went on at some length about F.A.A. diversity policies that encourage the hiring of people with severe disabilities, the same ones in place when he was in office last time.</p><p>What he could not say was whether any people with severe disabilities were actually hired as air traffic controllers as opposed to for other jobs compatible with their abilities. Nor could he say whether anyone on duty on Wednesday night fit that category.</p><p>Indeed, he acknowledged that there were many unanswered questions. “We don’t know that that would have been the difference,” he said of helicopter pilots not following instructions. He said he did not know whether another plane might have blocked the pilots’ view.</p><p>He said he did not know why adjustments were not made when the two aircraft hurtled toward each other. He said he did not know if the helicopter pilots were wearing night-vision goggles. “We don’t know that necessarily it’s even the controller’s fault,” he said at another point.</p><p>But just because he did not know all those things did not mean he was not certain who was to blame. No need to wait for the investigation to reach that conclusion.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2RlNWZhMTA3LTQ4MGItNWY0NS1hMTRlLTZjZGE3MTBmNGMzYw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/30/us/president-trump-news#doug-burgum-interior-secretary" data-source-id="100000009952745"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lisa-friedman"><img alt="Lisa Friedman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/multimedia/author-lisa-friedman/author-lisa-friedman-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/multimedia/author-lisa-friedman/author-lisa-friedman-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/multimedia/author-lisa-friedman/author-lisa-friedman-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-30T23:56:06.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 30, 2025, 6:56 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Burgum will be in charge of nearly 500 million acres of public land, 1.7 billion acres of offshore waters, and more than 70,000 employees tasked with protecting wildlife and managing national parks and tribal lands.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Doug Burgum, a promoter of oil and gas, was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday to lead the Interior Department, a role in which he will oversee drilling and mining policies on federal lands and waters.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/30/us/politics/burgum-senate-confirmation-vote.html" title="">79-18 vote</a> for Mr. Burgum puts him in charge of nearly 500 million acres of public land, 1.7 billion acres of offshore waters, and more than 70,000 employees across the country tasked with protecting wildlife and endangered species, managing national parks and maintaining tribal lands. </p><div><p>He is expected to be a key player to implement President Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda that calls for making it easier and cheaper for oil companies to operate, and loosening protections for wildlife as well as easing limits on air and water pollution.</p><p>In addition to leading the Interior Department, Mr. Burgum is also to run a White House council charged with encouraging more oil and gas development. The role of the council is still undefined but it is expected to help meet Mr. Trump’s goal of selling more American oil and gas to Europe and Asia.</p><p>During the presidential campaign, Mr. Burgum acted as a conduit between Mr. Trump and the oil and gas industry. He helped gather fossil fuel executives at Mar-a-Lago for a now-famous dinner, during which Mr. Trump suggested that industry leaders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/climate/trump-oil-gas-mar-a-lago.html" title="">raise $1 billion for his campaign</a>. He told the executives they would save far more than that in tax breaks and legal fees after he eliminated climate policies, according to several attendees who requested anonymity to discuss the private event.</p><p>Mr. Burgum’s role and his close ties to oil billionaires, including Harold Hamm, the founder of oil giant Continental Resources, drew criticism from many Democrats.</p><p>In written responses to lawmakers, Mr. Burgum sidestepped a question from Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, about whether he played a role in meetings between oil executives and Mr. Trump during the campaign where both public policy and campaign contributions were discussed.

But “we never talk about the assets,” he said. “It’s our responsibility to get a return for the American people.”</p><p>“Not every acre of federal land is a national park or a wilderness area,” Mr. Burgum said, adding, “Some of those areas we have to absolutely protect for their precious stuff, but the rest of it, this is America’s balance sheet.”</p><p>Mr. Burgum<span>  </span>declared that any curbs on energy production posed a national security threat and endorsed Mr. Trump’s vision of “energy dominance,” a phrase that is shorthand for more fossil fuel production.</p><p>He also insisted that the United States was in the midst of an energy crisis, even as it is <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">producing</a> more oil than any nation at any time in history and is the world’s leading exporter of liquefied natural gas.</p><p>Mr. Burgum said he would pursue an “all of the above” strategy but also said he would cut incentives for what he called “intermittent” power projects, referring to renewable energy like wind and solar power.</p><p>He said there has been too much so-called “intermittent” power built in recent years and not enough baseload, referring to gas or coal that can be stored and burned to produce electricity.</p><p>Emissions from the burning of fossil fuels produced on federal lands and waters <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2024/5103/sir20245103.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">account for nearly 22 percent</a> of U.S. greenhouse gases.</p><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Jan. 30, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported that Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, voted against Doug Burgum.

It is unclear whether he was informed of the decisions, which were disclosed on the condition of anonymity to describe personnel matters.</p><div><p>The employees given the apparent ultimatum had been promoted under Christopher A. Wray, who stepped down as F.B.I. director this month.</p><p>In an email to colleagues, one of the senior agents said he had learned he would be dismissed “from the rolls of the F.B.I.” as soon as Monday morning.</p><p>“I was given no rationale for this decision, which, as you might imagine, has come as a shock,” he wrote.</p><p>Senior F.B.I. agents had been bracing for potentially swift changes under President Trump given Mr. Patel’s past promise to reshape the institution. He has vowed to empty out the F.B.I. headquarters building and turn it into a museum.</p><p>The move is remarkable in part because it is happening before a director has been confirmed to take charge of the bureau, and the quick and unexpected nature of the requests has left employees badly shaken.</p><p>F.B.I. directors have more latitude than most agency chiefs in whom they place into senior positions, but they typically do so gradually. Until senators vote on Mr. Patel’s nomination, Brian Driscoll is the bureau’s acting director.</p><p>The decision by the Trump administration echoes the moves rapidly underway at the Justice Department, where career prosecutors, including top officials who hold significant sway over how the agency makes charging decisions, have been reassigned or fired.</p><p>At the F.B.I., some of the senior officials who have been asked to leave are at headquarters while others work in the field. Some have already taken steps to retire and exit the agency, including an agent who worked on the F.B.I.’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, and another who oversaw an investigation into Mr. Trump’s handling of classified documents.</p><p>A person familiar with the personnel changes said the top agent at the Washington field office, the second-largest in the bureau, was also given an ultimatum on Thursday. He had planned to retire, though intended to stay longer at the bureau to help with the transition. But his plans were cut short.</p><p>Still more are worried they will be pushed out of the agency or demoted.</p><p>During Mr. Patel’s confirmation hearing, Senator Cory Booker raised <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/justice-department-firings-trump-jack-smith.html" title="">the abrupt dismissals of nearly a dozen career prosecutors</a> at the Justice Department who worked on the criminal investigations into Mr. Trump under the special counsel Jack Smith and whether similar moves would extend to the F.B.I.</p><p>“Are you aware of any plans or discussions to punish in any way, including termination, F.B.I. agents or personnel associated with Trump investigations?” asked Mr. Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, after reminding Mr. Patel that he was under oath.</p><p>Stating that he had not been involved in the decisions at the Justice Department, Mr. Patel replied, “I am not aware of that, Senator.”</p><p>CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/30/politics/senior-fbi-leaders-demoted-wray/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earlier reported</a> that FB.I. officials had been demoted or resigned.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzFlYmJlODVhLTg0NzAtNWJhYy1iODNiLWRjNDQ2MjM3YTJlZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/30/us/president-trump-news#trump-arts-committee-disband" data-source-id="100000009959759"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jennifer-schuessler"><img alt="Jennifer Schuessler" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-jennifer-schuessler/author-jennifer-schuessler-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-jennifer-schuessler/author-jennifer-schuessler-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-jennifer-schuessler/author-jennifer-schuessler-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/julia-halperin"><img alt="Julia Halperin" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-30T22:19:53.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 30, 2025, 5:19 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lady Gaga and the producer Bruce Cohen recently served as co-chairs of the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The Trump administration has quietly dissolved the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, part of a flurry of executive orders aimed at rolling back the previous administration’s policies on art, culture and historical commemoration.</p><p>The move was part of President Trump’s first executive order, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued on Inauguration Day</a>, that reversed more than two dozen “harmful executive orders and actions” taken by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p><div><p>That order has drawn attention for its rollback of diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government, which has left federal museums and cultural organizations uncertain how to respond. The dissolution of the arts committee, made without comment from the White House, has been little noticed. At some point, its website was taken down.</p><p>Since it was established by President Ronald Reagan in 1982, the committee has brought together prominent artists, powerful allies of the president, academics and museum professionals to advise on cultural policy. Members have included the singer Frank Sinatra; the cellist Yo-Yo Ma; Terry Semel, a former chairman of Warner Bros.; and Robert Menschel, a former Goldman Sachs partner.</p><p>In the 1990s, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/25/arts/panel-pushes-for-revival-of-spending-on-the-arts.html" title="">petitioned President Bill Clinton</a> to restore funding for public arts education, to require high school students to have competency in a foreign language, and to expand tax incentives for cultural philanthropy. Under President Barack Obama, the committee developed Turnaround Arts, an experimental initiative to boost arts education in the nation’s lowest-performing schools.</p><p>The committee was nonpartisan. But during the first Trump administration, it inadvertently became a showcase for the mutual antagonism between Mr. Trump and what he has often derided as out-of-touch cultural elites.</p><p>In August 2017, 17 members resigned in protest over Mr. Trump’s response to the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/18/arts/white-house-arts-committee-resigns.html" title="">group open letter</a>, members including the artist Chuck Close, the novelist Jhumpa Lahiri and the architect Thom Mayne criticized what they said was Mr. Trump’s “support of the hate groups and terrorists who killed and injured fellow Americans.”</p><p>The White House then issued a statement saying Mr. Trump had already been planning to disband the group, calling it “not a responsible way to spend American tax dollars.”</p><p>Nearly two years into his administration, in September 2022, Mr. Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/30/arts/arts-humanities-commission-biden.html" title="">revived the group</a>, calling the arts “the soul of America, reflecting our multicultural and democratic experience.” His executive order cited the importance of the arts and humanities in tackling “the greatest challenges of our time, such as the climate crisis and the scourge of hate-fueled violence.”</p><p>In April 2023, Mr. Biden <a href="https://www.arts.gov/news/press-releases/2023/president-biden-announces-PCAH-members" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">named 31 members</a>, including prominent figures like George Clooney, Jon Batiste and Shonda Rhimes as well as museum curators, academics and the leaders of the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Smithsonian.</p><p>The co-chairs were the singer Lady Gaga and the producer Bruce Cohen, a Biden supporter who also received a <a href="https://www.arts.gov/honors/medals" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Medal of Arts</a> that same year.</p><p>The committee, which had <a href="https://www.facadatabase.gov/FACA/apex/FACACommitteeLevelReportAsPDF?id=a10t0000001h0ANAAY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an annual budget of roughly $335,000</a>, met six times after resuming operations. Its activities, according to public records, included reviewing a proposal for a campaign to combat the loneliness epidemic identified by Dr. Vivek Murthy, the former surgeon general.</p><p>Records do not indicate how many members of the group actively participated, or the range of subjects on which it offered advice. Its final meeting was held on Jan. 9.</p><p>Steve Israel, a former Democratic U.S. representative from New York who served on the committee, said he was disturbed by Mr. Trump’s move.</p><p>“Not only did he fire us all, but he disbanded the actual committee,” Mr. Israel said. “It suggests that there’s a proactive hostility toward arts and humanities.”</p><p>The dissolution of the committee was just one of the Trump administration’s recent actions touching on cultural matters, most of which reversed Mr. Biden’s initiatives or restored Trump efforts that Mr. Biden had undone.</p><p>On Wednesday, in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/trump-executive-orders-schools-antisemitism-race-gender.html" title="">an order dedicated to K-12 education</a>, Mr. Trump revived his 1776 Commission, which he created in 2020 to promote “patriotic education.” In a separate order, he <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/celebrating-americas-250th-birthday/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reinstated his call</a> for the creation of a National Garden of American Heroes and his executive order protecting monuments on federal land from vandalism.</p><p>That second order, titled “Celebrating America’s 250th Birthday,” reiterated Mr. Trump’s calls for a robust celebration of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/03/arts/america-250-anniversary-1776.html" title="">the Semiquincentennial of the Declaration of Independence</a>, in July 2026. As part of that, he announced a task force, led by him, that would “plan, organize and execute an extraordinary celebration.”</p><p>The order provided no details on funding or programming but specified that the task force would be housed within the Department of Defense.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
