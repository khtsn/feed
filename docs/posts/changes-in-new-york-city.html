    <h1>Changes in New York City</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>New York City faces an affordability crisis. Rents have soared. The century-old subway needs to be modernized, and buses are painfully slow. Piles of trash bags often line the sidewalks. The person tasked with fixing these problems, Mayor Eric Adams, faces a major corruption scandal.</p><p>His criminal case has obscured better news — that officials are advancing several ambitious proposals that hope to improve life in the city. The Democrats who run New York are crafting new policies because voters are concerned about their quality of life. The cost of living has become a campaign issue in Adams’s re-election next year, and his rivals are highlighting affordability.</p><p>Here are the proposals and how they could make things better for New Yorkers:</p><h2 id="link-4ca2cc9c">The proposals</h2><p><strong>Better transit: </strong>The streets of Manhattan are choked with traffic and double-parked delivery trucks. The nation’s first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nine-dollars.html" title="">congestion pricing plan</a> will charge vehicles entering Manhattan south of Central Park to reduce traffic and raise money for the struggling transit system. Drivers pay to enter the tolling zone using electronic passes on their windshields or photos of their license plates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">By Scott Reinhard</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The plan has been decades in the making. It still requires federal approval, and the Biden administration is poised to sign off before leaving office. Donald Trump and suburban lawmakers have vowed to kill it, arguing that it could hurt the city’s economic recovery from the pandemic. But New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, recently lowered the toll to $9 to help rally public support.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>Lower rental costs:</strong> Right now, if you rent an apartment in New York City, you have to pay thousands of dollars to a broker to secure a lease. A proposal in the City Council would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/nyregion/new-york-city-broker-fee-city-council.html" title="">shift that fee</a> from renters to landlords. A progressive young lawmaker proposed the bill, which just passed despite opposition from the real estate industry. Critics argued that landlords would pass along the cost by raising rents. The law will probably take effect next summer.</p><p><strong>Cleaner sidewalks:</strong> Foul-smelling heaps of trash bags <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/02/upshot/nyc-trash-rules.html" title="">appear on city sidewalks</a> on pickup day. They take up a lot of space, and they often tear and ooze into the street. Now the Adams administration is creating new rules for trash as part of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/08/insider/talking-trash-in-a-city-overflowing-with-it.html" title="">mayor’s war on rats</a>. Starting this month, residential buildings with nine units or fewer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/nyregion/nyc-trash-bin-rules.html" title="">must put garbage in cans</a>. Eventually, the city will remove parking spots in dense neighborhoods to make way for large on-street containers. Other major cities, like Barcelona and Buenos Aires, already do this.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">By Larry Buchanan</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Some homeowners and building staffers oppose the new trash rules, complaining about the look of the bins and the requirement that garbage be kept indoors until closer to the pickup time.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-425332d9">The political stakes</h2><p>The new proposals show how changes in local policy can have a major impact on the lives of the city’s eight million residents.</p><p>Here’s one example: I’m raising two little kids in Manhattan. The last mayor, Bill de Blasio, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/22/nyregion/prekindergarten-adams-nyc-3k.html" title="">started a free preschool program</a> for 3- and 4-year-olds — one that helped my family afford to stay in the city. (My son is in a city-funded preschool that he loves, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/nyregion/nyc-free-3k-preschool.html" title="">saving us more than $30,000 per year</a>.)</p><p>The current proposals similarly aim to make it easier to live in the city. Supporters of the broker fee bill have argued that it will allow artists to keep living in New York so it doesn’t end up as a home only for the wealthy.</p><p>Yesterday, the City Council moved forward with a proposal that would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/nyregion/housing-city-yes-nyc.html" title="">build more affordable housing</a> in neighborhoods and remove rules that require new buildings to create parking spaces. That has been contentious, and lobbying from neighborhood groups has weakened the plan. They don’t want high-rise apartments in less dense neighborhoods, and they want new homes to provide parking.</p><p>Although New Yorkers may disagree on tactics, most want to make the city more livable. More than half of voters here say the city is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/26/us/elections/times-siena-nyc-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html" title="">moving in the wrong direction</a>. Even my 4-year-old wants to see some changes in our neighborhood. I was walking him home from preschool when we came across a <a href="https://x.com/emmagf/status/1853852472319656162" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mound of black trash bags</a> lying in the crosswalk. As we veered around them, he scoffed and noted that they were not where they belonged.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Matt Gaetz</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><ul><li><p>Matt Gaetz <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/matt-gaetz-withdraws-attorney-general.html" title="">withdrew from consideration</a> to lead the Justice Department.

Bondi, who defended Trump during his first impeachment, leads a right-wing think tank.</p></li><li><p>Gaetz withdrew after CNN told him it planned to report that he had <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/21/politics/matt-gaetz-second-sexual-encounter-minor/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a second sexual encounter with a 17-year-old girl</a> in 2017, and after The Times reported that federal investigators had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/politics/matt-gaetz-venmo-payments-sex.html" title="">found payments Gaetz made to women</a> he had allegedly hired for sex.</p></li><li><p>Trump, who had privately conceded that Gaetz might not be confirmed but had made calls on his behalf, praised Gaetz in a Truth Social post. Trump said that Gaetz withdrew to avoid becoming a distraction for the administration and that he “has a wonderful future.”</p></li><li><p>Gaetz resigned from the House ahead of the release of an ethics report about him.</p></li></ul><p>Pete Hegseth</p><ul><li><p>Pete Hegseth, Trump’s pick to lead the Defense Department, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/pete-hegseth-sexual-assault-senate-republicans.html" title="">denied that he sexually assaulted a woman</a> in 2017 after a police report released this week detailed their encounter. “The matter was fully investigated, and I was completely cleared,” he said.</p></li><li><p>Several Republican senators have stood by Hegseth, noting that no charges were filed. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee lamented “the media’s focus on personal attacks.”</p></li><li><p>Hegseth, as an Army lieutenant in 2005, criticized soldiers who committed war crimes. By 2018, embittered by military dysfunction, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/pete-hegseth-defense-department.html" title="">he was defending them</a> as a Trump supporter on Fox News.</p></li></ul><p>More on the Trump Administration</p><ul><li><p>In a recount, Senator Bob Casey, a three-term Pennsylvania Democrat, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/bob-casey-david-mccormick-pennsylvania-senate.html" title="">conceded to Dave McCormick</a>, a Republican. The Republicans have 53 Senate seats next year.</p></li><li><p>Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right Georgia Republican, will lead a House panel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-doge-elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy.html" title="">focused on cutting government waste</a>, in concert with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.</p></li><li><p>Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/susie-wiles-trump-lobbying.html" title="">was a registered lobbyist until early this year</a>. Her clients included a tobacco company, a mining project and a cancer research foundation.</p></li><li><p>The House passed legislation that would let the government revoke the tax-exempt status of nonprofit groups <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/house-antiterror-financing-bill.html" title="">it accuses of supporting terrorism</a>. Democrats warned that Trump could exploit it to target his political enemies.</p></li><li><p>Trump claims that his “landslide” victory gives him “an unprecedented and powerful mandate” to transform the country. In fact, he’s set to win the popular vote <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/us/politics/trump-election-landslide.html" title="">by a small margin</a>.</p></li></ul><p>Middle East</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Benjamin Netanyahu, left, and Yoav Gallant.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Cohen/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ukrainian soldiers in eastern Ukraine.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bathing in oil in Naftalan, Azerbaijan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emile Ducke for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p><strong>N.H.L.:</strong> The Capitals star Alexander Ovechkin will miss four to six weeks with a fractured fibula.
