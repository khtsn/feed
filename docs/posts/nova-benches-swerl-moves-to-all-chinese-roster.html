<p>SWERL <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/323500/nova-welcome-swerl-as-their-duelist-player" target="_blank">joined</a> Nova as an Australian import ahead of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2006/champions-tour-2024-china-stage-1/regular-season" target="_blank">Stage 1</a> of 2024, bringing firepower to the duelist role. Nova was a mid-table team in China throughout 2024, but stuck with their roster going into 2025. The offseason showed promise for the team, during which they found a second-place finish at both the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2232/wall-e-cup" target="_blank">WALL-E Cup</a> and the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2289/superb-cup/playoffs" target="_blank">Superb Cup</a>. However, when <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2275/champions-tour-2025-china-kickoff/main-event" target="_blank">Kickoff</a> rolled around, Nova went 2-2, and were <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/430854/nova-esports-vs-dragon-ranger-gaming-champions-tour-2025-china-kickoff-lr2" target="_blank">eliminated</a> in a stomp at the hands of <span data-ref-id="3">

	<div data-post-id="4649424">
		
		
		<p>Honestly Swerl played well in their first match but after that they couldn&#39;t find their footing with him and they did really well without him in the evo series honestly a W move but sad to see none the less</p>

	<div data-post-id="4649799">
		
		
		<p>Am I the only one that thinks nova will be fine without swerl?Don&#39;t get me wrong Swerl is a good player but I respect the decision of Nova going full Chinese comm wise</p>

	<div data-post-id="4649807">
		
		
		<p>no anybody who&#39;s watched them knows this is a smart decision. ppl trying to discredit their evo win as mickey mouse didn&#39;t see them actually play</p>

			<p>Those who badmouth the organization just want to look down on CN and to see an Australian be the MVP in that region. In spite of being the duelist, he kept getting worse KDAs than his teammates and he even struggled against low-ranked opponents. Controllers, sentinels and initiators are all better at duels than him. Obviously no team needs such a liability.</p>
<p>Nova vs DRX</p>
<p>Nova vs Wolves</p>
<p>Nova vs EDG</p>
<p>Nova vs All Gamers</p>		</div>

	<div data-post-id="4650577">
		
		
		<p>This is a bit sad, but it makes sense. The org/team see the recent success without him and make a change in order to win. I still think swerl was a bit reason for their success. I hope he stays with NOVA to support his chinese brothers. </p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4650668">
		
		
		<p>yea but the recent success was against reserve teams</p>

</div></div></div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4650599">
		
		
		<p>I believe the main problem is their IGL o0o0o. Communication should never be a problem after more than one year with NOVA and two years in China. o0o0o&#39;s constant low fragging and bad IGLing led SWERL to lack consistency since he is not top-fragging in some maps because of being the hard entry. The solution is swapping SWERL from the hard entry-fragger to a more secondary duelist position. </p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4650674">
		
		
		<p>On one hand, they do indeed have CB and GuanG who can both play duelist. However, on the other hand, I don&#39;t think double duelist is viable enough to run on every map, and SWERL doesn&#39;t really regularly play other agents to a degree that could truly propel the team forwards. As a result, I nonetheless believe that it probably is better to just drop him instead of shifting the entire team dynamic to supplement him.</p>
