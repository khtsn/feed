He also raised tariffs on imports from China. Investors are concerned that the tariffs — and retaliation from the other countries — will fuel inflation, slow economic growth and hurt American businesses.</p><p>After sliding 3 percent over Monday and Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 staged a small recovery on Wednesday as the big tech stocks that have driven the market in recent years bounced and investors grew hopeful for some reprieve on tariffs. But the administration’s move to exempt auto manufacturing, along with products already part of a previous trade deal between the United States, Mexico and Canada, until April failed to settle investors’ concerns about the impact on the economy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The S&amp;P 500 is now almost 7 percent below a record set just over three weeks ago, which means it is close to falling into correction, defined as a sell-off of 10 percent or more from a recent peak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index and the Russell 2000, which tracks smaller companies that are typically more exposed to the economy, are both already in correction.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Joe Rennison writes about financial markets, a beat that ranges from chronicling the vagaries of the stock market to explaining the often-inscrutable trading decisions of Wall Street insiders.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-rennison">More about Joe Rennison</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Panama Canal:</strong> An investor group led by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/business/blackrock-panama-canal-ports-hutchison.html">BlackRock will acquire two ports near the Panama Canal</a> that are owned by CK Hutchison, a Hong Kong conglomerate, and that have been the subject of a dispute between President Trump and Panama.</p></li><li><p><strong>Foreign Aid to Resume:</strong> The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/foreign-aid-supreme-court-trump.html">rejected Trump’s emergency request to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid</a> as part of his efforts to slash government spending.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Properties:</strong> The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/trump-federal-property-buildings-sale.html">identified more than 440 federal properties</a> that could be sold off.
