Margaret didn’t just provide the children a meal that night and a respite from the war. In an unusual twist of events and decisions that Malcolm and his siblings would never fully know or understand until they were adults, they never returned to England. Mrs. Brock became their guardian and she bequeathed them the estate. </p><p>At 89, Malcolm is still in the rambling, 11-bedroom farmhouse, as the last surviving sibling. Muncy Farms — even as Malcolm worked and raised a family elsewhere for four decades — became his forever home. </p><p>“It is the heart and soul of my dad,” said his daughter, Cricket Barlow, who grew up visiting the property with him. “His world is the farm.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>He is the devoted caretaker of the property and the keeper of tales so intriguing that they motivated his brother Brian to pen a memoir.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Malcolm Barlow came to Muncy Farms at age 5 during World War II.

Tall and bald, with a friendly, patrician manner, Malcolm in his green wool sweater and gray slacks appeared the perfect country gentleman. He led the way through a long, wood-paneled library and into the dining room, where he had prepared a lunch of tuna fish salad on a bed of lettuce followed by raspberry shortcake for dessert.</p><p>Over the next few hours, Malcolm told the story of his family’s life in England before the war, and of coming to Muncy Farms and learning its long history.<span>   </span></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p><h2 id="link-56316013">From Rolls-Royce to Refuge</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The farm sits well off the main road, down a dirt (or snow-covered) lane that crosses an old railroad bridge. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Malcolm said he was born into the finer things: The Barlow family lived in a rented manor house near the coast in Suffolk, England, with five maids and a governess to watch the children. The money came from Violet, whose father ran a toiletries company. She drove a Rolls-Royce. But the outbreak of the war stripped the Barlows of their wealth, as it did to many European families.</p><p>In his self-published memoir, “<a href="https://www.jstwrite.com/store/p22/Only_One_Child.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Only One Child</a>,” the eldest of the Barlow children, Brian, describes how the family moved to a small cottage that was once an infirmary for his boarding school after the British Army commandeered their house for a living quarters. </p><p>The children’s father, Horace, had a friend in the American consulate, and the family relocated to London with hopes of securing U.S. visas for the four youngest children. A fifth child, Derrick Steedman, born by Violet’s previous marriage, was 17 and nearing military age, so by government policy had to stay in England.</p><p>The imperative to get the children to safety became more urgent in September 1940, when the Germans started the relentless bombing. As air-raid sirens wailed and fiery explosions rocked the city nightly, the Barlow family hid in a basement shelter. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The children were sent out of harm’s way through <a href="https://exhibitions.ushmm.org/americans-and-the-holocaust/personal-story/united-states-committee-for-the-care-of-european-children" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the United States Committee for the Care of European Children</a>, which placed several hundred refugee minors with American families to live out the war safely overseas.

Henry Brock was in prison.</p><p>The scion of a prominent Philadelphia family of bankers and industrialists, Mr. Brock was involved in a car accident in Philadelphia in 1923 that killed three pedestrians. The case became a society scandal in the press.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Brock served three years and two months before he was pardoned by the Pennsylvania governor. And Margaret Burgwin quickly became Mrs. Brock. “PROMINENT PHILADELPHIAN, JUST RELEASED FROM PEN, TO WED PITTSBURGH GIRL,” one headline read in June 1926. </p><p>The newlyweds moved to his family’s property, Muncy Farms.</p><p>The stone farmhouse was built by Samuel Wallis, a wealthy landowner and <a href="https://handsonheritage.com/revolutionary-war-traitor/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rumored British spy during the Revolutionary War</a> who amassed a 7,000-acre estate. In 1806, Muncy Farms was bought by <a href="https://steelmuseum.org/i-s-hall-of-fame/coleman_r.cfm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Robert Coleman</a>, an industrialist known as the “iron king” who became Pennsylvania’s first millionaire, and a forebear to Mr. Brock.<span>  </span>Thereafter, the estate was passed down in the Brock family, though it shrank in acreage over the generations.<span>    </span></p><p>Henry and Margaret undertook a major renovation of the manor house, importing a massive breakfront from a European castle and hand-painted Chinese wallpaper. They filled the home with <a href="https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-5823996" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">antiques and art acquired on travels</a>, and hired a local farmer and gardener to make the property a working farm. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Brocks decorated the house in 1926, importing Chinese painted wallpaper and antiques. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Framed charcoal portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Brock hung over Malcolm’s shoulders on the dining room wall as he spoke of them admiringly. </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>He never met Mr. Brock. </p><p>In fact, when Malcolm and his siblings arrived that dark night in 1940, Mrs. Brock was grief-stricken.</p><p>Three weeks before the Barlow children were due in Muncy, Mr. Brock died suddenly of appendicitis at age 54, leaving Mrs. Brock a grieving widow to care for this brood of strangers. </p><p>Malcolm said Mrs. Brock was a generous, optimistic person, despite her personal trials. The children called her “Aunt Peg” or “my guardian.”</p><p>As the baby, Malcolm was doted on by Mrs. Brock, with good intentions but to the possible detriment of his older siblings who also needed the attention. Brian and Susan, fraternal twins, were 12 when they made the life-changing journey, and Sheila was 10 — they’d had fuller lives in England, and felt the loss of leaving more keenly. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The four Barlow siblings as they appeared on arriving at Muncy Farms.

She paid for their educations in boarding schools and later universities. Brian served in the U.S. Army, married and had three children and became a schoolteacher in the Philadelphia area. Susan, who never wed or had children, worked as a librarian at a private school, also near Philadelphia. Sheila worked in the 1950s for the New York fashion photographer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/07/arts/francesco-scavullo-fashion-photographer-dies-at-82.html" title="">Francesco Scavullo</a> before marrying and starting a family in Miami.</p><p>Malcolm served in the Navy and attended Trinity College. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The wood-paneled library retains its original chestnut beams and handmade floor nails. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Winnie Au for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>In 1961, Mrs. Brock, dying of leukemia, called the four Barlows back to Muncy. In her will, she wrote that if it wasn’t a financial burden, they should keep the farm, as an anchor in America.</p><p>It was not as glamorous and fortuitous as it sounded. “We inherited this huge farm and had no cash,” Malcolm, who was 25 at the time, said. “We were land poor.” </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Holding on to the estate for decades hasn’t been easy. Initial attempts to farm the land and raise cattle were hindered by drought, a barn fire and bad financial decisions. And there were differing levels of interest in the farm among the siblings.</p><p>Malcolm kept his day job: He worked as an executive for a pharmaceutical firm that became GlaxoSmithKline, now GSK, and settled in Philadelphia with his wife, his daughter Cricket and his son Peter. But in 40 years, he never bought a house there, and he returned to Muncy Farms every chance he could. </p><h2 id="link-29cc7726">‘Rejuvenation’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-30"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Once a summer kitchen, the dining room was never wired for electricity.
