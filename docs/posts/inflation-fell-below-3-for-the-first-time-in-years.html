    <h1>Inflation Fell Below 3% for the First Time in Years</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div><div><p>Annual inflation cooled more than expected last month, to 2.9 percent, according to a Consumer Price Index report released today. It was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/business/cpi-inflation-july.html" title="">first time that the inflation gauge had dropped below 3 percent since 2021</a>.</p><p>“On a practical level, there’s no meaningful distinction between 2.9 percent and 3 percent,” our economics reporter, Ben Casselman, told me. “It’s the difference between your $6 latte costing $6.17 next year or $6.18. But the larger decline in inflation is absolutely significant.”</p><p>Just two years ago, prices were rising at more than 9 percent per year, and prominent economists were arguing that it would take a recession to bring inflation under control. “Now, inflation is basically back to its historic range, albeit still above where the Fed would like,” Ben said. “That’s a pretty remarkable turnaround.”</p><p>Most economists now see a recession-free “soft landing” as the likeliest scenario, Ben said. But the economy still faces potential hazards: The unemployment rate is low, but it has risen steadily, and many people are falling behind on their credit card bills. Those factors, along with cooling inflation, have put the Federal Reserve firmly on track to cut interest rates at its meeting next month.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The war in Gaza has gone on for more than 10 months with only a one-week pause in November.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eyad Baba/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-30a2c3a">Israel’s military has achieved all it can in Gaza, U.S. says</h2><p>Israel’s military response to the Oct. 7 attacks has done far more damage to Hamas than U.S. officials had first predicted.

The move is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/politics/trump-voter-outreach-super-pacs.html" title="">likely to save the campaign money</a>, but some senior Republican Party officials worry that it puts too much responsibility in the hands of inexperienced groups without oversight. Democrats, who rely on labor unions that can coordinate with campaigns, have not followed suit.</p><p><strong>Here’s what else to know:</strong></p><ul><li><p>New polls showed Kamala Harris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/politics/harris-trump-polls.html?smid=url-share" title="">slightly ahead of or tied with Trump</a> in six of the seven battleground states.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Christian conservatives are laying the groundwork <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/republicans-christian-conservatives-ivf.html" title="">for a fight against I.V.F.</a></p></li><li><p>President Biden is upset with Nancy Pelosi, and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/politics/pelosi-biden.html" title="">two have not spoken</a> since she began her effort to push him out of the race.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Your questions:</strong></p><p>We asked readers what they’d like to know about the election. For today’s question, I turned to Ruth Igielnik, our polling editor.</p><p><em>“Are there really any undecided voters? The two candidates are so different, it seems like everyone knows how they will vote.” — Susan Stevens from Lakeside, Mich.</em></p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>You’re absolutely right that, in this highly polarized era, only a very small percentage of voters are actually undecided in this election.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Depending on the state, it could be anywhere between 3 and 7 percent of voters. And in key swing states, that can be the entire margin of victory for a candidate. So, winning over a sizable chunk of the roughly 5 percent of voters in Michigan who are undecided may be the difference between losing and winning the election.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/nyregion/2024-election-questions.html?te=1&amp;nl=the-evening&amp;emc=edit_ne_20240802" title="">You can send questions to us here</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A scan of the brain of a 42-year-old patient in a coma.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Zephyr/Science Source</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-72c46cc4">Unresponsive patients may have some awareness</h2><p>Hundreds of thousands of patients in the U.S. have been diagnosed as minimally conscious or in a vegetative state after suffering severe brain damage.
