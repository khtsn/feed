Even though Mr. Trump did not figure as centrally in elections here as he did in Canada, the worldwide turmoil arising from his trade and diplomatic decisions weighed on Australian voters.</p><p>It remained to be seen whether Mr. Albanese’s party would hold on to its slim majority in Parliament. A record number of seats are held or are being closely challenged by independent and minor-party candidates, making it more likely that Mr. Albanese would need the support of smaller players to form a government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People lining up to vote at a polling station on Saturday in Sydney, Australia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mridula Amin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The disaffection with the two major parties appeared particularly acute among younger people in an election where Gen Z and Millennial voters for the first time outnumbered baby boomers. Younger voters are defecting from the two leading parties because they feel little faith either have bold solutions for the challenges facing the country, said Intifar Chowdhury, a lecturer in government at Flinders University in Adelaide who focuses on youth political representation.</p><p>“These guys are kind of giving us little bites. Increasingly, it started to feel like band aids to a bullet wound,” she said. In giving Mr. Albanese a second term, she said, “you are choosing the known evil over the unknown evil.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/victoria-kim">Victoria Kim</a> is the Australia correspondent for The New York Times, based in Sydney, covering Australia, New Zealand and the broader Pacific region.</p></div><div><p>Yan Zhuang is a Times reporter in Seoul who covers breaking news.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Anniversary of the Vietnam War: </strong>Photography from Vietnam changed how the world saw the war, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/vietnam-war-photography-impact.html">how Americans saw their own country</a> and the war itself, which ended 50 years ago.
