His loss echoed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/world/canada/pierre-poilievre-canada-election-loss-parliament.html?smid=url-share" title="">the ouster of Canada’s conservative leader</a>, Pierre Poilievre, whose defeat was seen as a rejection of his embrace of Mr. Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Australia was the third major U.S. ally, after Germany and Canada, to hold elections since Mr. Trump’s second term began in January. The Trump administration’s efforts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/world/europe/takeaways-germany-election.html" title="">influence the vote in Germany</a> did not appear to bear fruit. In Canada, Mark Carney won another term on an anti-Trump platform. While Mr. Trump did not figure as prominently in Australia’s election, the worldwide turmoil arising from his trade and diplomatic decisions weighed on voters there.</p><p>Even though Mr. Trump was not mentioned by name on Saturday night, the nods to his influence were clear. In his victory speech, an emotional Mr. Albanese said Australians had chosen “to face global challenges the Australian way.”</p><p>“We do not need to beg, or borrow or copy from anywhere else,” he said. “We do not seek our inspiration overseas.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lining up to vote at a polling station on Saturday in Sydney, Australia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mridula Amin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>For many younger voters, Mr. Albanese’s re-election was not an approval of his first term but a reluctant choice between two parties without bold ideas to fix the country’s problems, said Intifar Chowdhury, a lecturer in government at Flinders University in Adelaide.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In giving Mr. Albanese’s party a second term, she said, “you are choosing the known evil over the unknown evil.”</p><p>With about half the votes counted, the ABC projected that the Labor Party would widen its parliamentary majority in the 150-seat House of Representatives to at least 86 seats, from 78.</p><p>Voters casting their ballots Saturday said they were struggling to make ends meet.</p><p>“Everything costs so much,” said Judy Pula, a registered nurse and mother of two who was voting in the Sydney suburb of Liverpool during a break in her shift. Ms. Pula, 29, said she had voted for Labor in the past but this time opted for the Australian Greens. “I feel like a new leader would be beneficial for us.”</p><p>Cognizant of citizens’ pocketbook concerns, Mr. Dutton went to more than a dozen gas stations on the campaign trail, pitching his party’s proposal to cut a tax to reduce the price at the pump. Mr. Albanese repeatedly <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-23/mediscare-medicare-health-policy-urgent-care-clinics/105201480" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flashed his card for Medicare</a>, Australia’s universal health care system, highlighting a promise to lower out-of-pocket costs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Peter Dutton, the opposition leader, speaking to the news media after voting in Brisbane on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dan Peled/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Yet both parties mostly put forth largely incremental, short-term relief proposals rather than ambitious changes to address the fundamental roots of the current doldrums.

Move on. Why don’t they address the other issues out there?”</p><p>Ms. Young, a mental health nurse, still cast her vote for Mr. Dutton’s center-right Liberal Party, because she wanted Labor out of power.</p><p>Saturday’s victory for Mr. Albanese was a hard-fought recovery from the political low point of his first term: the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/world/asia/indigenous-voice-australia-referendum.html" title="">failure of a 2023 referendum</a> to enshrine the rights of representation for Aboriginal Australians in Parliament. It had been a major campaign pledge of his when he was elected the previous year.</p><p>Mr. Dutton, a former police officer, opposed the measure and continued to take a stance against other symbolic recognitions of Indigenous people, saying they were “<a href="https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/iran-port-explosion-injures-hundreds-20250427-p5luhc?post=p58kce" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overdone</a>.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People filling out their vote cards at a polling station in Sydney.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mridula Amin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Early in the campaign, the opposition leader had adopted some buzzwords or policies that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/world/asia/australia-election-trump-china.html" title="">echoed Mr. Trump</a> and a few of his pet causes, including denouncing what he characterized as “wokeness” and diversity initiatives. That strategy seemed aimed at riding the worldwide rightward, anti-incumbent currents that dominated last year. But as the first months of the Trump presidency have played out, the association began to hurt Mr. Dutton.</p><p>Grahame Don, 56, voted for the Liberal Party for decades but started backing Labor in the last election. Mr. Trump’s tone of talking about issues was bleeding into Australian politics, he said on Saturday.</p><p>“This country has only gained from things like migration and international students that they have tried to make divisive,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/victoria-kim">Victoria Kim</a> is the Australia correspondent for The New York Times, based in Sydney, covering Australia, New Zealand and the broader Pacific region.</p></div><div><p>Yan Zhuang is a Times reporter in Seoul who covers breaking news.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/anthony-albanese">Anthony Albanese</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/peter-dutton">Peter Dutton</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Anniversary of the Vietnam War: </strong>Photography from Vietnam changed how the world saw the war, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/vietnam-war-photography-impact.html">how Americans saw their own country</a> and the war itself, which ended 50 years ago.
