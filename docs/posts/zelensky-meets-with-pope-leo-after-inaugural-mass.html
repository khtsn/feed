The pope’s secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, said the offer was “the availability of a space” and called the Vatican an “appropriate place” for peace talks.</p><p>In the service at St. Peter’s Basilica on Sunday, Leo spoke forcefully about people suffering because of wars around the world.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Martyred Ukraine awaits negotiations for a just and lasting peace,” Leo said at the end of the service, echoing language used by his predecessor, Pope Francis.<span>  </span></p><p>Mr. Zelensky thanked the pope for his “special words,” saying in a social media post that “every nation deserves to live in peace and security.” After meeting with Leo, he also thanked the Vatican ”for its willingness to serve as a platform for direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia.” </p><p>“The Holy See can play an important role in ending the war because of its voice and authority,” he <a href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1924099530510721138" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media.</a></p><p>The U.S. secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said the Vatican could be a venue for Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations, but neither Russia nor Ukraine have indicated whether they would take the pope up on his offer.</p><p>On Sunday, Mr. Rubio attended the inaugural Mass, as did Vice President JD Vance. Mr. Zelensky shook hands with Mr. Vance as he arrived.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It was the second time Mr. Zelensky visited the Holy See in recent weeks. When he attended the funeral of Pope Francis on April 26, Mr. Zelensky <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/world/europe/ukraine-trump-zelensky-putin.html" title="">met privately</a> with President Trump, which yielded a striking image of the two men facing each other on metal chairs in an ornate hall. It was the first time they had met since the February <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/us/politics/zelensky-showdown-trump.html" title="">sit-down in the Oval Office</a> in February, in which Mr. Trump castigated the Ukrainian leader.</p><p>It was unclear whether any informal meetings on Ukraine would take place after the Mass. </p><p>Friedrich Merz, Germany’s new chancellor, told reporters in Rome on Sunday that he had spoken with Mr. Rubio about Mr. Trump’s upcoming phone call with Mr. Putin. Speaking with reporters after the service had concluded, Mr. Merz said that he and the leaders of France and the United Kingdom were planning to try to speak to Mr. Trump before that phone call.</p><p>“My strong impression is that both Europeans and Americans are determined to work together, but now also in a focused manner, to ensure that this terrible war ends soon,” Mr. Merz said.</p><p>On Saturday, Mr. Zelensky said that he had met with Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada and President Karin Keller-Sutter of Switzerland separately in Rome to discuss how to increase pressure on Russia to end the war.</p><p>The search for peace in Ukraine has gathered pace in recent weeks. Delegations from the two sides held their first direct talks in Turkey on Friday and later agreed on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/world/europe/ukraine-pow-prisoners-exchange.html" title="">prisoner exchange</a>.</p><p>Pope Francis, who died on April 21, regularly called for peace in Ukraine.</p><p>Since his election, Leo has signaled a deep interest in ending the war. Last week, he used his first Sunday address to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/11/world/europe/pope-leo-xiv-address-peace.html" title="">call for</a> an “authentic, just and lasting peace” in Ukraine and for all prisoners of war to be freed. He added that children should be returned to their families. Although he did not specify which children, many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/europe/russia-ukraine-children-deportation-adoption.html" title="">Ukrainian children</a> have been taken to Russia against the wishes of their families since the war began.</p><p>Christopher F.
