Putin of Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/europe/russia-putin-victory-day-parade.html" title="">welcomed the presidents of China and Brazil, among other international officials, to Moscow</a> to mark the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/europe/russia-victory-day-parade-moscow.html" title="">a military parade</a>, intended to place Russia at the vanguard of a rising, non-Western world order.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ahead of the visit, the four European nations voiced support for President Trump’s call, first made in March, for a 30-day cease-fire in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine agreed to Mr. Trump’s proposal, but Russia has pushed instead for negotiating the terms of a settlement before any sustained pause in hostilities.</p><p>“We reiterate our backing for President Trump’s calls for a peace deal and call on Russia to stop obstructing efforts to secure an enduring peace,” the four countries said in a joint statement issued late Friday. “Alongside the U.S., we call on Russia to agree a full and unconditional 30-day cease-fire to create the space for talks on a just and lasting peace.”</p><p>The latest European initiative comes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/europe/ukraine-russia-zelensky-trump-peace-talks.html" title="">after Mr. Trump said</a> on Thursday that the United States would impose sanctions on Russia if it did not accept an extended cease-fire.</p><p>The trip’s aim, the four leaders said, was to demonstrate “solidarity with Ukraine against Russia’s barbaric and illegal full-scale invasion.” They added: “Ukraine must be able to prosper as a safe, secure and sovereign nation within its internationally recognized borders for generations to come.”</p><p>The leaders also plan to hold a virtual meeting with other Western heads of government to update them on plans, promoted by Mr. Macron and Mr. Starmer, to try to create a “coalition of the willing” to help secure Ukraine in the event of a peace deal with Russia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Despite their show of unity, those talks on constructing the coalition of the willing have lost momentum, with no sign of an imminent peace agreement and uncertainty about what role European countries could play in it if there was one.</p><p>Discussions have included the possibility of a limited deployment of Western forces to Ukraine, but many nations do not want to make clear commitments without knowing the conditions of any peace deal. Mr. Starmer has said he would be willing to send British troops to Ukraine, but only if the United States provides a security backstop — something Mr. Trump has shown little sign of promising.</p><p>In their statement, the four European nations described the talks as now being focused on “a future coalition of an air, land, maritime and regeneration force that would help regenerate Ukraine’s armed forces after any peace deal and strengthen confidence in any future peace.”</p><p>The Europeans said they were ready ”to support peace talks as soon as possible, to discuss technical implementation of the cease-fire, and prepare for a full peace deal.”</p><p>In an online address to a meeting of the Joint Expeditionary Force member states in Oslo on Friday, Mr. Zelensky said, “We need this Coalition — and we need it to be strong enough to guarantee security the way we all agree on.”</p><p>“Moscow should accept the cease-fire,” he said, “because that’s the only way real peace can start.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stephen Castle is a London correspondent of The Times, writing widely about Britain, its politics and the country’s relationship with Europe.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping Rebuke U.S.</strong><strong>: </strong>The two leaders, meeting in Moscow, rejected what they described as Washington’s attempt to contain them. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/world/europe/putin-xi-meeting-trump.html">They also hailed their friendship</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sanctions on Russia?:</strong> President Trump said the United States would impose sanctions on Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/europe/ukraine-russia-zelensky-trump-peace-talks.html">if it did not accept an extended cease-fire in its war with Ukraine</a>, writing on social media after a phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.</p></li><li><p><strong>Odesa&#39;s Cultural Battle:</strong> A push to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/world/europe/odesa-ukraine-russia-culture.html">rename streets and remove statues associated with imperial Russia</a> is dividing Odesa, Ukraine, whose identity is tied up in its history.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Community Blown Apart</strong><strong>: </strong>The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/europe/kyiv-russia-missile-strike.html">talked to more than a dozen family members, neighbors and friends of the victims</a> of the deadliest attack in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, since last summer.</p></li><li><p><strong>‘</strong><strong>We Lost Your Son’</strong><strong>: </strong>Russia lacks any formal, organized effort to account for legions of missing soldiers. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/world/europe/russia-missing-soldiers-ukraine-war.html">That often leaves relatives in limbo</a>, fending for themselves with scant government information.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Verify Our Reporting</strong></p><ul><li><p>Our team of visual journalists analyzes satellite images, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/insider/verifying-images-of-the-war-in-ukraine.html">photographs</a>, videos and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/28/world/europe/reskin-russian-radio-ukraine-war.html">radio transmissions</a> to independently confirm troop movements and other details.</p></li><li><p>We monitor and authenticate reports on social media, corroborating these with eyewitness accounts and interviews. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/world/europe/ukraine-war-journalism.html">Read more about our reporting efforts</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
