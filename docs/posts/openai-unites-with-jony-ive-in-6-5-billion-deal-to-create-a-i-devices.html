    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The rise of artificial intelligence has profoundly altered the technology world in recent years, upending how software is created, how people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/technology/personaltech/google-ai-mode-search.html" title="">search for information</a>, and how images and videos can be generated — all with a few prompts to a chatbot.</p><p>What the technology has yet to do, though, is find a preferred form in a physical, everyday gadget. A.I. largely remains the domain of an app on phones, despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/technology/humane-ai-pin.html" title="">efforts by start-ups</a> and others to move it into devices.</p><p>Now OpenAI, the world’s leading A.I. lab, is taking a crack at that riddle.</p><p>On Wednesday, Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, said the company was paying $6.5 billion to buy IO, a one-year-old start-up created by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/technology/jony-ive-apple-lovefrom.html" title="">Jony Ive</a>, a former top Apple executive who designed the iPhone. The all-stock deal, which effectively unites Silicon Valley royalty, is intended to usher in what the two men call “a new family of products” for the age of artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I., which is shorthand for a future technology that achieves human-level intelligence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21biz-openai-ive-altman-btkl/21biz-openai-ive-altman-btkl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21biz-openai-ive-altman-btkl/21biz-openai-ive-altman-btkl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21biz-openai-ive-altman-btkl/21biz-openai-ive-altman-btkl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Sam Altman is wearing a headset microphone." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21biz-openai-ive-altman-btkl/21biz-openai-ive-altman-btkl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21biz-openai-ive-altman-btkl/21biz-openai-ive-altman-btkl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21biz-openai-ive-altman-btkl/21biz-openai-ive-altman-btkl-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21biz-openai-ive-altman-btkl/21biz-openai-ive-altman-btkl-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/b9083c96-3956-5568-9a3e-5429a8b3ce28" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive.

LoveFrom will assume creative and design responsibilities across OpenAI and build hardware that helps people better interact with the technology.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In a joint interview, Mr. Ive and Mr. Altman declined to say what such devices could look like and how they might work, but they said they hoped to share details next year. Mr. Ive, 58, framed the ambitions as galactic, with the aim of creating “amazing products that elevate humanity.”</p><p>“We’ve been waiting for the next big thing for 20 years,” Mr. Altman, 40, added. “We want to bring people something beyond the legacy products we’ve been using for so long.”</p><p>Mr. Altman and Mr. Ive are effectively looking beyond an era of smartphones, which have been people’s signature personal device since the iPhone debuted in 2007. If the two men succeed — and it is a very big if — they could spur what is known as “ambient computing.” Rather than typing and taking photographs on smartphones, future devices like pendants or glasses that use A.I. could process the world in real time, fielding questions and analyzing images and sounds in seamless ways.</p><p>Mr. Altman had invested in Humane, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/technology/silicon-valleys-big-bold-sci-fi-bet-on-the-device-that-comes-after-the-smartphone.html" title="">company that pursued this kind of vision</a> with the creation of an A.I. pin. But the start-up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/technology/humane-ai-pin.html" title="">folded</a> not long after its product flopped.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-6"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Humane A.I.

Scott Cannon, Evans Hankey and Tang Tan, who also founded IO with Mr. Ive, will become OpenAI’s employees and report to Peter Welinder, a vice president of product, who will oversee the IO division. The acquisition is a significant windfall for Mr. Ive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photo of Mr. Ive and Mr. Altman provided by Mr. Ive’s design studio, LoveFrom.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via LoveFrom</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>OpenAI already owned a 23 percent stake in IO as part of an agreement between the two companies at the end of last year, two people with knowledge of the deal said, so it is now paying around $5 billion to fully acquire the start-up. OpenAI separately has a Start-Up Fund that invested in Mr. Ive’s start-up last year, the people said. The deal is subject to regulatory approval.</p><p>(The New York Times has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" title="">sued</a> OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, for copyright infringement regarding news content related to A.I. systems. OpenAI and Microsoft have denied the claims.)</p><p>OpenAI set off the A.I. boom in late 2022 when it released the ChatGPT chatbot. In March, the start-up completed a $40 billion funding that valued it at $300 billion, making it one of the world’s most valuable private companies. The fund-raising round was led by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.</p><p>As it has grown, OpenAI has struggled to adopt a new corporate structure. Founded in 2015 as a nonprofit organization, the A.I. lab has been trying to reinvent itself as a for-profit company so it can more easily raise money from investors. If it does not restructure by the end of the year, SoftBank could halve its investment in the company.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>That makes the billions that OpenAI is paying for Mr. Ive’s start-up a steep outlay, especially as the start-up is also unprofitable. Building the technology that powers ChatGPT and other services is enormously expensive, and OpenAI is under pressure to raise revenues.</p><p>OpenAI expects about $3.7 billion in sales this year and about $11.6 billion next year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/openai-chatgpt-investors-funding.html" title="">according to financial documents</a> reviewed by The Times. The company is also in talks to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/technology/openai-windsurf-talks.html" title="">acquire Windsurf</a>, an A.I.-powered programming tool, for about $3 billion.</p><p>Asked how OpenAI would find the money to buy IO, Mr. Altman said the press worried about OpenAI’s funding and revenues more than the company did.</p><p>“We’ll be fine,” he said. “Thanks for the concern.”</p><p>The deal came together after Mr. Ive, a protégé of the Apple founder Steve Jobs who designed the iPod and many other products, became intrigued by A.I. He felt somewhat lost after leaving Apple in 2019, he said, and was eager to find his next act.</p><p>Two years ago, Charlie Ive, one of his 21-year-old twin sons, told him about ChatGPT, Mr. Ive said. Curious about his son’s excitement over the chatbot, Mr. Ive connected with Mr. Altman. They became friends.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Ive said he was so enamored with the technology that he founded IO last year with several peers to conceptualize new hardware products suited to A.I. By early this year, it became clear that he and Mr. Altman wanted to form a partnership to work on a new generation of devices, he said.</p><p>Mr. Ive said the partnership was being led not by a fiscal imperative but from a place of building products that “benefit humanity.”</p><p>“I believe everything I’ve done in my career was leading to this,” he said.</p><p>Tripp Mickle<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mike Isaac is a technology correspondent for The Times based in San Francisco.
