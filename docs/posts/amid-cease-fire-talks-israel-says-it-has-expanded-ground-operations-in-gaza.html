But many civilians, including children, have been killed, according to Palestinian officials and residents of Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The expansion of military operations comes even as Israel and Hamas are engaged in indirect talks for a cease-fire in Doha, the capital of Qatar.</p><p>More than 53,000 Gazans have been killed so far in the war, according to health officials in the enclave, whose death tolls do not distinguish between combatants and civilians. The health ministry in Gaza said on Sunday that the preliminary number of those killed since dawn stood at more than 90.</p><p>Suzanne Abu Daqqa, who lives in Abasan, near the southern city of Khan Younis, said residents had been living through near-constant bombardment over the past few days, rattling her home with terrifying blasts.</p><p>But she was even more afraid that a renewed ground invasion could again force her to flee her house — where her family still had some electricity from solar panels, as well as a modest stockpile of rice and flour — for sweltering tent camps near the coast.</p><p>“So many have died for nothing,” Ms. Abu Daqqa said. “People want the war to end by all means.”</p><p>International efforts have so far failed to broker an end to the war that began with the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. That attack killed about 1,200 people, and the Palestinian assailants took about 250 hostages back to Gaza.</p><p>Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabel Kershner, a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, has been reporting on Israeli and Palestinian affairs since 1990.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of Tensions in the Middle East</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> West Bank Attack:</strong> An Israeli woman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/world/middleeast/west-bank-shooting-pregnant-woman.html">on the way to a hospital to give birth</a> was shot and killed in the territory, in an attack that Hamas applauded as a “heroic act.”</p></li><li><p><strong> </strong><strong>Gazans Once Escaped to Rafah.
