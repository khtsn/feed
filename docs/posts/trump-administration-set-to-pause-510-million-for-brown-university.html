    <h1>Trump Administration Set to Pause $510 Million for Brown University</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Daily Caller was the first to report the pause.</p><p>The newly appointed secretary of education, Linda McMahon, has been explicit about the administration’s focus on elite universities, which Mr. Trump has criticized as bastions of left-wing thought. She has said that taxpayer support is a “privilege” that can be withdrawn if universities do not adhere to civil rights law.</p><p>After the Trump administration threatened to pull hundreds of millions of dollars in research grants and contracts from Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania last month, Brown was one of the few universities that <a href="https://today.brown.edu/announcements/193712" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released a statement</a> in response, saying that it would not compromise on academic freedom.</p><p>In the statement, Christina H. Paxson, the president of Brown, said that some of Mr. Trump’s demands “raise new and previously unthinkable questions about the future of academic freedom and self-governance.” She said that if Brown’s essential academic and operational functions were threatened, the university “would be compelled to vigorously exercise our legal rights to defend these freedoms.”</p><p>Before the Trump administration targeted Princeton University for cuts on Tuesday, its president, Christopher L. Eisgruber, had also been vocal about the federal attack on colleges. He <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/columbia-academic-freedom/682088/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called the targeting</a> of Columbia “the greatest threat to American universities since the Red Scare of the 1950s.”</p><p>The government’s campaign against specific universities began in February, when a new federal task force against antisemitism issued a list of 10 universities that it planned to investigate. The administration cited claims that the schools may have failed to protect Jewish students and faculty members from discrimination during pro-Palestinian protests on campuses in 2023 and 2024.</p></div></div>
