Harris … Governor Walz” to the tune of “To the window … to the wall!” from another hit, “Get Low.”</p><p>His surprise appearance on the convention floor was part of an effort by Democrats to turn the staid tradition of the roll-call vote that nominated Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota into something of a party. Hosted by D.J. Cassidy, delegates were instructed to “pass the mic around the nation” as each state cast a symbolic vote for Ms. Harris accompanied by a meaningful tune. Some featured a surprise celebrity guest.</p><p>(Ms. Harris is already the party’s nominee, having been chosen via a virtual vote two weeks ago. But delegates on the floor saw no need to spoil the fun.)</p></div></div><div><div><p>Alabama kicked off the proceedings with “Sweet Home Alabama” rocking in the background. Colorado played a few beats from “September” by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire — one of the band’s lead singers is from Denver.</p><p>“We know how to climb mountains, and we’re going to make sure Kamala Harris and Tim Walz reach the summit,” the state’s chosen delegate said as he cast Colorado’s votes for the Democratic ticket.</p><p>The opening lines of “Sirius,” the song used to introduce the legendary 1990s Chicago Bulls teams, played as Illinois cast its votes, but it was not Michael Jordan in front of the microphone: It was the state’s governor, JB Pritzker. Sean Astin, the actor from “Rudy” who played the title character, who tries to make the University of Notre Dame football team, had a cameo for the Indiana delegation.</p><p>California and its governor, Gavin Newsom, closed the boisterous session, with Mr. Newsom proclaiming that he was from “the great state of Nancy Pelosi” as the San Francisco politician and former speaker of the House stood beside him.</p><p>A succession of California rap songs, including “California Love” by Tupac and “Not Like Us” by Kendrick Lamar, played in the background. Ms. Harris, who is from the state, accepted the nomination as she rallied supporters in Milwaukee.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But if there was any question that Georgia Democrats lacked enthusiasm — or a taste for the spotlight — Lil Jon had the scene-stealing answer.</p><p>“We not going back,” he sang, leading the crowd in a chant of what has become Ms. Harris’s rallying cry.</p><p>Nick Corasaniti<!-- --> and <!-- -->Maya King<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kellen Browning is a Times reporter covering the 2024 election, with a focus on the swing states of Nevada and Arizona.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kellen-browning">More about Kellen Browning</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
