The White House announced late that day that Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a dual Israeli American citizen, was among the dead, and Mr. Biden spoke to Mr. Goldberg-Polin’s parents on Sunday morning.</p><p>“I am devastated and outraged,” Mr. Biden said in a statement on Saturday offering his condolences. He added that he would continue to work “around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages.”</p><p>The president appeared to be working behind the scenes throughout last week. He spoke with the prime minister of India last Monday and was spotted talking on the phone and reading papers on the beach. He briefly addressed reporters about the hostages after attending Mass on Saturday evening, but otherwise tried to stay out of the public eye, emerging only on Wednesday and Saturday for afternoons on the beach.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Some beachgoers, thrilled to find themselves on the same stretch of sand as the president, offered waves and greetings, but Mr. Biden, wearing red patterned swim shorts, a black cap and his signature aviators, turned his blue lounge chair around to avoid the onlookers — and at least one television camera. His wife, Jill, joined him both days.</p><p>The locals in Rehoboth Beach are largely protective of a president who has become a hometown fixture and did not blame him for keeping a low profile.</p><p>“I felt he was very respectful,” said Steve Shrader, 77, who got responses to both of his shouted messages — the second of which encouraged the president to “hang in there!” Mr. Biden gave him a nod and a thumbs-up.</p><p>“I don’t support him,” Mr. Shrader added. “I’m a Republican.” But he was nonetheless charmed by his brush with the president, who he felt has been treated unfairly in recent weeks. “I said it to be gracious to him.”</p><p>The Bidens have vacationed in Rehoboth Beach for decades and bought their home in 2017, the fulfillment of a promise Mr. Biden made to his wife. The first lady once told Vogue that the beach house was exactly what she had wanted — a place where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/04/us/politics/rehoboth-delaware-biden.html" title="">“everything’s easy.”</a> Early in his presidency, Mr. Biden spent weekends on the beach while adjusting to the White House.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Biden was in Rehoboth Beach in July when he decided to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/us/politics/biden-drops-out.html" title="">drop out of the presidential contest</a> and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/biden-2024-election-dropped-out.html" title="">Cloistered in a spare bedroom</a>, battling a bout of Covid and at odds with many of his own allies who had been pressuring him to step aside, he and two of his closest advisers drafted the announcement that he would end his re-election campaign.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-5"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Biden greeting a family in 2022.

After a week on an 8,000-acre ranch in Santa Ynez belonging to Joe Kiani, a tech entrepreneur and major Democratic Party donor, Mr. Biden returned home to Rehoboth Beach and hunkered down.</p><p>Lori Kline, 58, runs <a href="https://www.lorisoyveycafe.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lori’s Oy Vey! Cafe</a> in Rehoboth Beach and has sent several birthday cakes and countless sandwiches to the family over the years. She has run the sandwich shop for nearly 30 years and even added a menu item named after Mr. and Ms. Biden: “The Bidens’…. POPULAR!!!” (The sandwich is half of each of their favorites, chicken salad and tuna.)</p><p>Seated in the quiet courtyard dining area under a blanket of trees, Ms. Kline said that while the president had not dropped by for a long time, staff members and Secret Service agents often picked up large orders there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>She recalled Anthony Bernal, the first lady’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/biden-2024-election-dropped-out.html" title="">closest adviser</a>, who also joined the Bidens on the beach last week, coming by to pick up food shortly after Mr. Biden announced he would drop out.</p><p>“I talked to him for a long time and I just cried,” Ms. Kline said.</p><p>“I’m not saying it was wrong or right,” she added, “but just how he was treated as a person really upset me.”</p><p>Ms. Kline said she was surprised but glad that Mr. Biden was staying through the busy Labor Day weekend, when crowds rush into town to enjoy the last of the summer. On Saturday, dozens of people stopped on streets, balconies and rooftops downtown to watch the president’s motorcade zip past, taking him to St. Edmond Catholic Church.</p><p>When Mr. Biden stepped from the church after Mass, a small crowd kept at bay by the Secret Service greeted him with mostly cheers and one person’s booing. One woman repeatedly called out, “We love you!,” forcing Mr. Biden to pause as he spoke with reporters about the war in Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Biden made one of his few public appearances on Saturday night after attending Mass, to speak with reporters about the war in Gaza.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael A. McCoy for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Ms. Kline said she hoped Mr. Biden would return to his old haunts once his presidency ended and the frenzy around him had died down.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I mean, he’ll still have security with him,” Ms. Kline said. “But I would hope that by next summer he’s walking around town, coming here for a sandwich and eating ice cream from Double Dippers.”</p><p>Joe Mack, who founded that sunny-yellow ice cream parlor with a beach mural on the walls, said the shop still keeps the president’s favorite chocolate chip ice cream in the first spot in its display, in hopes that Mr. Biden will return. The president has not dropped by since before the pandemic.</p><p>“If I still owned the place, I would put a huge sign in the window saying ‘Great job, Joe’ or something,” said Mr. Mack, 61. He sold Double Dippers to a younger couple last year but still pitches in to say hello to his summer regulars — every few minutes, a customer or friend juggling a cone of ice cream greeted Mr. Mack on Friday.</p><p>Mr. Mack said it was hard to let go of a lifetime spent building relationships and developing bonds tied to the shop. His advice for another Joe approaching retirement reflected the lessons he has learned: “Take a deep breath and relax. Get on the beach more.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
