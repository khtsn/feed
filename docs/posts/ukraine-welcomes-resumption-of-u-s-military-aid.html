Ukraine agreeing to the cease-fire proposal was another — but only if Russia agrees to do the same.</p><p>While Ukrainians were deeply skeptical that Russia would accept the proposal for a cease-fire, the unfreezing of critical American assistance was widely seen as a positive development that could help mend the ruptured relationship between Kyiv and Washington.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I would like to thank President Trump for the constructive nature of the dialogue between our teams,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in his nightly address to the nation — seemingly taking care to publicly express gratitude after he was accused of not being appreciative enough during a disastrous Oval Office meeting last month with the American president that led to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/trump-ukraine-military-aid.html" title="">the suspension of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing.</a></p><p>The sudden reduction in support came after weeks of growing tension as the White House seemed to more closely align itself with the Kremlin while increasing the pressure on its ally.</p><p>Ever since, Ukraine has sought to smooth over relations with the Trump administration. French and British officials coached the Ukrainian delegation before the talks in Jeddah about how to speak with the Americans, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/zelensky-saudi-arabia-prince-ukraine-meeting.html?searchResultPosition=23" title="">a Ukrainian official with the delegation said</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>U.S. officials attending talks with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday in a photograph released by the Ukrainian president’s office.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ukrainian Presidential Press Service, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Tykhyi said that a key challenge for the Ukrainian delegation was to “control emotions” ahead of the meeting. Once the talks opened on Tuesday, he added, the Oval Office debacle also played a role in determining “the boundaries of the space for compromises and influenced the negotiating positions.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It took more than eight hours of discussions to reach an agreement.</p><p>“It is in these last hours of the endgame, when fatigue is already showing, that a way out of the impasse and even difficult compromises suddenly become possible,” he said</p><p>At the conclusion of the meetings, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the burden was now on Russia to end the war.</p><p>“The ball is now in their court,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky echoed that sentiment in his speech to the nation. “Russia must also show whether it is ready to end the war — or continue it,” he said. “The time has come for the whole truth.”</p><p>If Russia does agree to the cease-fire, the challenge will be to make the peace enduring, Mr. Zelensky said.</p><p>The Kremlin has not said whether it will agree to the 30-day cease-fire. But the Ukrainian skepticism is informed by history: Russia violated two previous cease-fires, reached in 2014 and 2015, and denied an intention to invade just days before doing so in 2022.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“In my opinion, it will be like before when they introduced the cease-fire,” said Oleksandr Kovinko, a soldier fighting in eastern Ukraine. “We adhere to it, the enemy does not. And how it will actually be, it’s hard to imagine and predict.”</p><p>And for the Ukrainians who feel betrayed by the Trump administration’s recent moves, there was a fear that the United States might not be an honest broker.</p><p>“I have no hope that the U.S.A. has not completely shifted to Russia’s side,” said Yulia Podkydysheva, 31, a charity worker reached by phone in Chernivtsi, in western Ukraine.</p><p>Everyone, Ms. Podkydysheva said, could use 30 days “to breathe some air and see the light” after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia" title="">three years</a> of unrelenting bombardment. But she does not think that rest will last.</p><p>“It will most likely be about some next round of struggle,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine in February.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Liubov Sholudko<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Marc Santora has been reporting from Ukraine since the beginning of the war with Russia. He was previously based in London as an international news editor focused on breaking news events and earlier the bureau chief for East and Central Europe, based in Warsaw.
