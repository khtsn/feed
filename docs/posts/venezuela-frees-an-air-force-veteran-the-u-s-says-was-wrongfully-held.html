The family declined further comment.</p><p>His release marks the second time that Venezuela has released Americans from detention since President Trump took office in January.</p><p>Six American prisoners came home from Venezuela in late January after Richard Grenell, a special envoy, made an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/politics/us-prisoners-venezuela.html" title="">unusual and highly public visit</a> to Caracas, the capital, to meet with the autocratic president, Nicolás Maduro.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The meeting prompted criticism of the Trump government for lending legitimacy to a leader accused of widespread human rights abuses and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/world/americas/venezuela-election-results.html" title="">stealing a recent election</a>. The Venezuelan leader had not had a public visit from a U.S. official in years, and the meeting was seen as a win for him.</p><p>Others argued that bringing Americans home was worth the effort.</p><p>Mr. St. Clair did four tours in Afghanistan and had traveled to Costa Rica to get treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, his father <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/world/americas/americans-hostages-venezuela-prison.html" title="">told The New York Times in March</a>. He said he was not sure how his son ended up in Venezuela and was “floored” when he found out he was in prison.</p><p>“He served his country,” the older Mr. St. Clair told The Times. At the time he was concerned about how his son’s P.T.S.D. would affect him in prison.</p><p>“I am in a very dark room,” the father said, “and I am looking for a sliver of light.”</p><p>The State Department has said that Joseph St. Clair, whose release was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, was wrongfully detained.</p><p>In the family’s statements on Tuesday, his parents, Scott and Patti St. Clair, said, “This news came suddenly, and we are still processing it — but we are overwhelmed with joy and gratitude.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>They thanked President Trump and Mr. Grenell, among others.</p><p>“We remain in prayer and solidarity with the families of those who are still being held,” the family added. “We will never stop loving and supporting them as they continue their fight to be reunited with their loved ones.”</p><p>With Mr. St. Clair’s release there are still eight U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents who remain in Venezuelan custody.</p><p>Venezuela is in dire economic condition, and Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/us/politics/trump-tariffs-venezuela-oil.html" title="">threatened to choke off</a> much of its international oil trade with new tariffs and other measures. Mr. Maduro’s government has signaled its willingness to cooperate with the United States, accepting deportation flights and releasing prisoners, hoping to head off the moves against its oil industry and ease existing sanctions.</p><p>As Mr. Maduro has lost support both abroad and at home in recent years, his government has arrested dozens of prisoners from around the world to use as leverage in negotiations.</p><p>Sophie Hunter, whose brother Lucas Hunter is among the Americans still detained in Venezuela, said in a statement that her family was “grateful” to learn of Mr. St. Clair’s release.</p><p>“It gives us hope that Lucas will come home to us soon,” she said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Genevieve Glatsky is a reporter for The Times, based in Bogotá, Colombia.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
