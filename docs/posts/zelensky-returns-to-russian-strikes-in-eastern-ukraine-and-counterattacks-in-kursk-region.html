Trump</a>, Russian forces were pressing their grinding advance in Ukraine’s east, capturing more villages and closing in on a key Ukrainian stronghold.</p><p>They also continued their assault on Ukrainian cities, killing 10 in Sumy, in the northeast, in a strike on Saturday, while maintaining their attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure and energy facilities. Ukraine, for its part, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-ammunition-depots.html" title="">struck several Russian ammunition depots</a> in an attempt to disrupt Moscow’s military logistics.</p><p>Here’s a closer look at the current situation on the battlefield.</p><h2 id="link-5f4ddac">Russia presses ahead in the east</h2><p>For the past few months, Russia has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/world/europe/ukraine-eastern-front-line.html" title="">concentrated its attacks on the area around Pokrovsk</a>, a road and rail hub in eastern Ukraine, and Moscow’s forces are within about five miles of the city. The capture of Pokrovsk would seriously disrupt the Ukrainian Army’s logistical lines in the surrounding Donetsk region.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>After making quick progress toward Pokrovsk, Russia’s direct advance has slowed in recent weeks. Its troops have run up against a line of Ukrainian fortifications, strengthened by reinforcements sent by Kyiv, defending the city’s outskirts.</p><p>Ukrainian soldiers and military experts say they now expect a more protracted battle for Pokrovsk that could lead to the city’s being seized after a sustained bombing campaign, similar to Russia’s earlier assaults on cities such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/22/world/europe/bakhmut-ukraine.html" title="">Bakhmut</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/world/europe/avdiivka-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">Avdiivka</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Digging trenches in the Pokrovsk region of Ukraine this month.

Moscow’s troops have been trying to encircle the towns of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/11/world/europe/russia-pokrovsk-advance.html" title="">Kurakhove</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/04/world/europe/ukraine-defense-east.html" title="">Vuhledar</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Vuhledar, which has been a Ukrainian stronghold, is now caught in a pincer movement, with only 1.5 miles separating the western and eastern flanks of the Russian attack around the town. “Vuhledar is likely to fall very soon,” Mr. Kofman said.</p><p>Mykola Bielieskov, a military analyst at the government-run Institute for Strategic Studies in Ukraine, said that Russian troops had improved their encirclement tactics, pushing through weak points in Ukrainian lines with small squads. “It has increased the tempo of their advances,” he said in a text message, adding that Russia currently does not have the capacity to launch large-scale offensives.</p><p>The Russian Army may be trying a similar pincer movement around <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/08/17/world/russia-ukraine-news" title="">Kupiansk, a town in the northeast</a> that Ukrainian forces recaptured in the fall of 2022. Its troops have recently seized a narrow spit of land to the south of Kupiansk, pushing toward the Oskil River.</p><p>A drone battalion from Ukraine’s 92nd brigade <a href="https://t.me/fedorenkoys/549" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said last week</a> that it had repelled a large-scale Russian assault toward the river which involved around 50 armored vehicles. The claim could not be independently verified.</p><h2 id="link-61ba2aff">Counterattacks near the northern border</h2><p>Since launching its offensive into the Kursk region of western Russia in August, Ukraine has captured about 400 square miles there. But this month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-kursk.html" title="">Moscow’s troops began counterattacking</a>, reclaiming several villages.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Vincent Tourret, an analyst at the French Foundation for Strategic Research, said that the Ukrainian cross-border offensive had lifted morale and shown Western partners that Kyiv could still take the initiative. But he added that it had failed to divert Russian troops from hot spots on the eastern front and had come at an important cost in military equipment.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A destroyed home in the Sumy region of northeastern Ukraine this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Guttenfelder for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>An open-source intelligence researcher who uses the online handle <a href="https://x.com/naalsio26" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Naalsio</a> and who analyzes combat footage reported that, a month into Ukraine’s offensive, which began on Aug. 6, Kyiv had lost at least 121 pieces of equipment in the Kursk region — comparable to Russian losses near Pokrovsk over the same period. Russian equipment losses near Kursk, however, were three times greater than Ukraine’s losses near Pokrovsk, Naalsio reported, an assessment that could not be independently confirmed.</p><p>To respond to the Ukrainian offensive, Russia has pulled some troops from the area it captured this spring in the Kharkiv region, according to analysts, helping Ukrainian forces to go back on the attack in that area.</p><p>Last week, the Ukrainian Army said it had recaptured a large plant, now mostly in ruins, in Volchansk, a town northeast of the city of Kharkiv that Russia had tried to seize during its spring offensive. Geolocated footage <a href="https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-september-24-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analyzed by the Institute for the Study of War</a>, a Washington-based think tank, indicated that the Ukrainians had “likely seized” the plant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-266bfa03">Punishing air assaults</h2><p>In recent days, Russia has hit several Ukrainian cities that are relatively distant from the front lines, sometimes using powerful bombs carrying hundreds of pounds of explosives, according to the Ukrainian authorities. Those attacks, which have resulted in civilian casualties, have heightened the sense among Ukrainians that no city is safe.</p><p>Ukrainian officials said that 10 people were killed in an attack on a hospital in Sumy on Saturday.
