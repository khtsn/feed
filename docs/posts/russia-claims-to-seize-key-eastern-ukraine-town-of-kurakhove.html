Soldiers fighting in the area, and a local Ukrainian military official, said when reached by phone that while there were pockets of resistance in the factories on the outskirts, the town was essentially lost. They requested anonymity to discuss sensitive military information.</p><p>In a statement, the Kremlin said its defense minister, Andrei Belousov, had congratulated the Russian soldiers for capturing the town on Monday,</p><p>The fall of Kurakhove and surrounding towns could allow Russia to broaden its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/world/europe/russia-ukraine-pokrovsk-attacks.html" title="">assault on the city of Pokrovsk</a>, 21 miles to the north, military analysts said.</p><p>Russian forces are trying to encircle Pokrovsk, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/world/europe/ukraine-russia-evacuation-pokrovsk.html" title="">focal point</a> of the war in recent months, from the south, hoping to avoid brutal and prolonged urban combat.

Trump prepares to take office, analysts said.</p><p>Mr. Trump has vowed to bring the war to a quick end without saying how.</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a three-hour conversation with the podcaster Lex Fridman, expressed confidence that Mr. Trump could fulfill that promise.</p><p>“I think that President Trump not only has will, he has all these possibilities, and it’s not just talk,” he said. “I really count on him, and I think that our people really count on him, so he has enough power to pressure him, to pressure Putin.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ukrainian soldiers carrying the coffins of comrades killed in recent fighting in eastern Ukraine, during a funeral procession in the western city of Lviv, last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Finbarr O&#39;Reilly for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The appearance with a podcaster popular in Trump circles — including with Elon Musk, who highlighted the interview on his social media network, X — appeared to be an attempt to communicate directly with Trump supporters.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky also reaffirmed his belief that there can be no lasting peace unless Ukraine is militarily strong and supported by the United States.</p><p>“If we do not have security guarantees, Putin will come again,” he said.</p><p>Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, echoed those concerns wile traveling in South Korea on Monday.</p><p>“There is going to be, at some point, a cease-fire. It’s not going to be in Putin’s mind ‘game over,’” Mr. Blinken told reporters. “His imperial ambitions remain, and what he will seek to do is to rest, refit, and eventually reattack.”</p><p>Mr. Blinken also said that Ukraine’s campaign in Kursk would play a critical role in any peace talks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“The positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region are very important,” he said, “because, of course, this is something that will be relevant to any negotiations that may take place in the coming year.”</p><p>North Korea has dispatched more than 11,000 soldiers to fight alongside the Russian in Kursk, Ukrainian and American officials have said, and Mr. Blinken said the partnership between the two countries continues to grow. He reiterated previous assertions that Moscow was prepared to supply North Korea with advanced space and satellite technologies in return for weapons and equipment to aid its war efforts in Ukraine.</p><p>Despite the introduction of North Korean troops to the battle for Kursk, Ukraine has managed to hang on to more than 150 square miles of land inside Russia — a bit less than half the amount of territory it initially seized.</p><p>However, the amount of territory Ukraine holds inside Russia is less important than the message the campaign sends to the world, military analysts said.</p><p>“Kursk is a strategic shift in the narratives of the war,” said Taras Chmut, a former military officer and the head of <a href="https://savelife.in.ua/en/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Come Back Alive</a>, a charity that supports the Ukrainian military. “It’s about the fact that Russia can lose territories, its own territories.
