    <h1>It’s ‘Trump’s America’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Donald Trump, who promised to smash the American status quo and radically reshape the federal government, will be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/politics/trump-wins-presidency.html" title="">the next president of the United States</a>. That reality became clear to millions of jubilant fans and anxious critics early this morning, when Trump passed the necessary 270 electoral votes. This afternoon, Kamala Harris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/06/us/trump-election-harris-news" title="">conceded the race</a>.</p><p>“It is OK to feel sad and disappointed, but please know it is going to be OK,” Harris said to a crowd of tearful supporters in Washington. “Here’s the thing: Sometimes the fight takes a while.”</p><p>By this evening, Trump’s electoral victory is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-president.html" title="">shaping up to be substantial</a>: He won all five of the battleground states that have been called so far, he leads by comfortable margins in the other two and he is on track to become the first Republican to win the popular vote in 20 years. The Republicans also took control of the Senate, which will allow Trump to more easily carry out his priorities. Control of the House <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/06/us/elections/results-house-races-tracker.html" title="">has yet to be determined</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kamala Harris after her concession speech at Howard University in Washington. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cheriss May for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The real America becomes Trump’s America,” a historian said.</p><h2 id="link-461216a4">How Trump won</h2><p>Trump became the first former president <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/politics/trump-grover-cleveland-second-term.html" title="">in more than 120 years</a> to get elected for a second nonconsecutive term by shifting the country to the right. Compared to 2020, Trump made gains <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/06/us/politics/presidential-election-2024-red-shift.html" title="">in every corner of the country</a> and with nearly every demographic group.

But many voters still found him unappealing, and his projected margin in the popular vote does not indicate a landslide. His victory may <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/upshot/trump-election-victory.html" title="">say more about the country’s dissatisfaction with Harris</a> and the Democratic Party.</p><p>President Biden, who dropped out of the race just over 100 days ago, was deeply unpopular.
