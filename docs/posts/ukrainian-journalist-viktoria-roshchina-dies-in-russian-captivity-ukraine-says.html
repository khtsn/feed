rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Committee to Protect Journalists said in a statement</a>. “Both Ukrainian and Russian authorities must do everything in their power to investigate this tragedy.”</p><p>Ms. Roshchina worked as a freelance reporter for several independent Ukrainian publications, including Ukrainska Pravda and Hromadske.</p><p>She focused on reporting from Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine, including writing about the <a href="https://hromadske.ua/ru/posts/gorod-sveta-reportazh-iz-okkupirovannogo-energodara" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer"
