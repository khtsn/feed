His father, J.D. Foreman, was a railroad construction worker. His mother was Nancy Ree (Nelson) Foreman. As an adult, he learned that his biological father was a man named Leroy Moorehead.</p><p>Foreman was candid about having been a bully and a petty criminal in his youth. After dropping out of school, he joined the Job Corps at 16. At 17, he tried his hand at boxing.</p><p>Success came quickly in the amateur ranks; only a year and a half later he was Olympic heavyweight champion, defeating Ionas Chepulis of the Soviet Union by a second-round knockout in Mexico City in 1968.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After the fight, Foreman, who was Black, waved a small American flag in the ring, days after the track athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised clenched fists during the national anthem to protest the country’s treatment of Black people.</p><p>“I was just glad to be an American,” Foreman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/23/archives/new-champion-reveals-blessed-ability-as-promised-told-frazier-of.html" title="">said afterward</a>. “Some people have tried to make something of it, calling me an Uncle Tom, but I’m not. I just believe people should live together in peace.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Foreman, right, and Joe Frazier, the defending World Boxing Association champion, moments before their world heavyweight title fight in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1973.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Turning professional, he started a heavy schedule of fights, as many as a dozen in a year. He was 37-0 when he got his first shot at a world heavyweight title against Frazier in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1973.</p><p>Though he was a 3-1 underdog, Foreman dominated the fight, knocking Frazier down six times before the contest was stopped halfway through the second round. One of those knockdowns led the television announcer Howard Cosell to utter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZEIMQ42-oU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of boxing’s most famous calls</a>: “Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“It was unbelievable,” the New York Times sports columnist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/23/archives/an-abrupt-end-to-the-frazier-reign-arthur-daley-alis-plea-goesdown.html" title="">Arthur Daley wrote</a>. “In little more than four and a half minutes, George Foreman destroyed Joe Frazier tonight, and the man who supposedly couldn’t lose never had even one ghost of a chance for victory. So there is a new heavyweight champion of the world, and he won it with authority in an explosive demonstration of overpowering punching skills.”</p><p>Foreman defended the title twice before a match with Ali in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) in 1974 that would become known as the Rumble in the Jungle. This time, Foreman was the favorite, but Ali reclaimed the title, dealing Foreman his first career loss.</p><p>Ali used his “rope-a-dope” strategy, resting on the top rope and allowing Foreman to punch him but also to tire himself out. Ali finished the fight with a left-right combination knockout in the eighth round.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ali finished his 1974 title fight with Foreman a left-right combination knockout in the eighth round.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Foreman had five more victories, including another one over Frazier. But after losing to Jimmy Young in 1977, he elected to hang up his gloves at age 28, citing his religious beliefs and his mother’s wishes.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>He turned to religious vocation in his retirement years, by serving as a nondenominational Christian minister in Houston and by starting a youth center.</p><p>But the ring lured him back. “I want to be champion again,” he said in 1987. “I’ve got a three-year plan. I want to start at the bottom. Train harder than any man in the world. Fight once a month.”</p><p>He admitted that money was a factor as well. “You know that story about how you have four pockets in your pants, and you better save what’s in one pocket so you can live?” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/26/sports/sports-of-the-times-foreman-s-second-wind.html" title="">he told Dave Anderson of The Times</a>. “I saved one pocket. I’ve got money for steak and potatoes. But the other three pockets I just blew.”</p><p>Sure enough, Foreman fought frequently, as many as nine times in a year. He cranked out 24 straight wins, although most were against boxers of lesser ability. That set him up for a title shot at age 42 against Holyfield, the champion, in 1991. Foreman lost the decision but put forth a creditable performance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In 1994, after a decade away from the ring, Foreman shocked the world by beating the undefeated Michael Moorer in Las Vegas to reclaim the world title.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">John Gurzinski/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>The Times described Foreman as “fit and courageous.” But the general reaction was that his performance was little more than a brave effort. Surely that seemed to be the end of Foreman’s title dreams.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>He scored a few more wins and lost to Tommy Morrison, but then he managed to land another title shot in 1994, in Las Vegas against Moorer, 26, who had defeated Holyfield. Some called it undeserved and suggested that Foreman got the chance only because of his fame and the novelty of his age. “It’s not about deserving,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/03/sports/sports-of-the-times-can-foreman-try-to-rope-a-dope-too.html" title="">he said with a smile</a>, “because I’ve got it.”</p><p>Foreman was trailing on the judges’ scorecards when he managed to land the big punch he was looking for and knocked Moorer out in the 10th round. Moorer had thrown 641 punches, to 369 by Foreman. But the last one was the one that counted.</p><p>Foreman had stood rather than sit on a stool between rounds, as if to defy his 45 years. He became the oldest heavyweight champion in history.</p><p>“Anything you desire, you can make happen,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/sports/boxing-foreman-flattens-moorer-with-blast-from-the-past.html" title="">he said after the fight</a>. “It’s like the song, ‘When you wish upon a star your dreams come true.’ Well, look at me tonight.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Foreman defended his belt against a German fighter, Axel Schulz. But the governing bodies that awarded the championship began to strip him of his belts as he declined to fight the challengers they mandated. Instead, Foreman faced and defeated a couple of lesser fighters. His final fight was a loss, a close decision to Shannon Briggs in 1997. He was 48.</p><p>He finished with a professional record of 76-5 and is widely regarded as one of the 10 best heavyweight fighters of all time; <a href="https://www.ringtv.com/488242-ring-greatest-heavyweight-time/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Ring magazine survey</a> in 2017 ranked him seventh. He was inducted into the <a href="http://www.ibhof.com/pages/about/inductees/modern/foreman.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Boxing Hall of Fame</a> in 2003.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Foreman at a news conference in 2001 in London introducing the George Foreman Grill to the British market.

Foreman helped make the grills an American kitchen mainstay.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>In 1999, Salton Inc. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/10/business/salton-pays-137.5-million-for-george-foreman-s-name.html" title="">paid $137.5 million</a> for worldwide rights to use Foreman’s name on grills; Foreman got about 75 percent of the payout. He also endorsed mufflers, fried chicken and chips.</p><p>Foreman’s affability helped him transcend boxing and cross over into the media world. In 1993-94, in the midst of his comeback, he starred in “George,” a short-lived sitcom on ABC in which he played a retired boxer helping troubled youth, and he made guest appearances on several other shows over the years. He appeared in a Venus-flytrap costume on the reality competition show “The Masked Singer” in 2022. (His performance of “Get Ready” by the Temptations was not enough to stave off elimination.)</p><p>That same year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/sports/george-foreman-accused-sexual-abuse.html" title="">two women sued Foreman</a> in California, accusing him of sexually abusing them in the 1970s, when they were teenagers. They alleged that he had met them when they were under 10 years old and then groomed them for several years before forcing them to have sex with him.</p><p>A third woman sued him in 2023 on the same charge. All three, who were not related, had fathers who had worked closely with Foreman.</p><p>Foreman denied the allegations. In October he attempted to have the charges trimmed to exclude episodes said to have taken place in Texas and Florida. While California has loosened the statute of limitations around sexual abuse cases, those two states have not. A judge denied his motion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>In addition to his brother, Foreman is survived by his wife, Mary Joan Martelly, whom he married in 1985. He had previously been married four times.</p><p>He is also survived by six daughters, Natalie, Leola, Michi, Georgetta, Isabella and Courtney Foreman; five sons; 15 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. Another daughter, Freeda Foreman, died in 2019.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In 2023 at the world premiere of the movie “Big George Foreman: The Miraculous Story of the Once and Future Heavyweight Champion of the World” in Los Angeles.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Tran/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>All of Foreman’s sons were named George: George Jr., George III, George IV, George V and George VI.
