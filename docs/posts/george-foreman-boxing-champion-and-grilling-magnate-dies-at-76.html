He was 76.</p><p>His family announced his death on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHe5UtIJ4IQ/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his Instagram account</a>. Roy Foreman, George’s brother, said the cause of death was not known.</p><p>When Foreman returned to the ring after 10 years away, there was skepticism that a fighter of his years could beat any younger fighter, much less come back to the top of the game. But in 1994, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/sports/boxing-foreman-flattens-moorer-with-blast-from-the-past.html" title="">beat the undefeated Michael Moorer</a> to reclaim the world title, shocking the boxing world.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Foreman’s career spanned generations: He fought Chuck Wepner in the 1960s, Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali in the ’70s, Dwight Muhammad Qawi in the ’80s and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/20/sports/holyfield-keeps-title-foreman-wins-respect.html" title="">Evander Holyfield</a> in the ’90s.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>George Foreman training in Kinshasa in 1974.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>And his popularity helped him make millions selling grills after his retirement.</p><p>George Edward Foreman was born Jan. 10, 1949, in Marshall, Texas, to Nancy Ree (Nelson) Foreman and J.D. Foreman, a railroad construction worker. As an adult, he learned that his biological father was a man named Leroy Moorehead.</p><p>Foreman was candid about being a bully and a petty criminal in his youth. After dropping out of school, he joined the Job Corps at 16. At 17, he tried his hand at boxing.</p><p>Success came quickly in the amateur ranks; only a year and a half later he was Olympic heavyweight champion, defeating Ionas Chepulis of the Soviet Union by a second-round knockout in Mexico City in 1968.</p><p>After the fight, Foreman, who was Black, waved a small American flag in the ring, days after the track athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised clenched fists during the national anthem to protest the country’s treatment of Black people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“I was just glad to be an American,” Foreman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/23/archives/new-champion-reveals-blessed-ability-as-promised-told-frazier-of.html" title="">said afterward</a>. “Some people have tried to make something of it, calling me an Uncle Tom, but I’m not. I just believe people should live together in peace.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>George Foreman, right, and Joe Frazier, the defending WBA champion, moments before their world heavyweight title bout in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1973.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Turning professional, he started a heavy schedule of fights, boxing as many as a dozen times in a year. He was 37-0 when he got his first shot at a world heavyweight title against Frazier in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1973.</p><p>Though he was a 3-1 underdog, Foreman dominated the fight, knocking Frazier down six times before the contest was stopped halfway through the second round. One of those knockdowns led the television announcer Howard Cosell to utter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZEIMQ42-oU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of boxing’s most famous calls</a>: “Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!”</p><p>“It was unbelievable,” the Times sports columnist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/23/archives/an-abrupt-end-to-the-frazier-reign-arthur-daley-alis-plea-goesdown.html" title="">Arthur Daley wrote</a>. “In little more than four and a half minutes, George Foreman destroyed Joe Frazier tonight, and the man who supposedly couldn’t lose never had even one ghost of a chance for victory. So there is a new heavyweight champion of the world, and he won it with authority in an explosive demonstration of overpowering punching skills.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Foreman defended the title twice, before a match with Ali in Zaire in 1974 that would become known as the Rumble in the Jungle. This time, Foreman was the favorite, but Ali reclaimed the title, dealing Foreman his first career loss.</p><p>Ali used his rope-a-dope strategy, resting on the top rope and allowing Foreman to punch him, but also tire himself out. Ali finished the fight with a left-right combination knockout in the eighth round.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Kinshasa in 1974.

I want to start at the bottom. Train harder than any man in the world. Fight once a month.”</p><p>He admitted money was a factor as well. “You know that story about how you have four pockets in your pants, and you better save what’s in one pocket so you can live?” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/26/sports/sports-of-the-times-foreman-s-second-wind.html" title="">he said</a>. “I saved one pocket. I’ve got money for steak and potatoes. But the other three pockets I just blew.”</p><p>Sure enough, Foreman fought frequently, as many as nine times in a year. He cranked out 24 straight wins, although most were against boxers of lesser ability. That set him up for a title shot at age 42 against the champion, Holyfield, in 1991. Foreman lost the decision but put forth a creditable performance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>George Foreman after knocking Michael Moorer out in 1994 in Las Vegas.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">John Gurzinski/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>The Times described Foreman as “fit and courageous.” But the general reaction was that his performance was little more than a brave effort. Surely, that seemed to be the end of Foreman’s title dreams.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>He scored a few more wins and lost to Tommy Morrison, but then managed to land another title shot in 1994 against Moorer, 26, who had defeated Holyfield. Some called it undeserved and suggested that Foreman got the chance only because of his fame and the novelty of his age. “It’s not about deserving,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/03/sports/sports-of-the-times-can-foreman-try-to-rope-a-dope-too.html" title="">he said with a smile</a>, “because I’ve got it.”</p><p>Foreman was trailing on the judges’ scorecards when he managed to land the big punch he was looking for and knocked Moorer out in the 10th round in Las Vegas. Moorer had thrown 641 punches, to 369 by Foreman. But the last one was the one that counted.</p><p>Foreman had stood rather than sit on a stool between rounds as if to defy his 45 years. He became the oldest heavyweight champion in history.</p><p>“Anything you desire, you can make happen,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/sports/boxing-foreman-flattens-moorer-with-blast-from-the-past.html" title="">he said after the fight</a>. “It’s like the song, ‘When you wish upon a star your dreams come true.’ Well, look at me tonight.”</p><p>Foreman defended his belt against a German fighter, Axel Schulz. But the governing bodies that awarded the championship began to strip him of his belts as he declined to fight the challengers they mandated. Instead, Foreman faced and defeated a couple of lesser fighters. His final fight was a loss, a close decision to Shannon Briggs in 1997. He was 48.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>He finished with a professional record of 76-5 and is widely regarded as one of the 10 best heavyweight fighters of all time; <a href="https://www.ringtv.com/488242-ring-greatest-heavyweight-time/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Ring Magazine survey</a> in 2017 ranked him seventh. He was inducted into the <a href="http://www.ibhof.com/pages/about/inductees/modern/foreman.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Boxing Hall of Fame</a> in 2003.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>George Foreman launching a grill in 2001 in London.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anthony Harvey/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Foreman returned to his youth center, did commentary for televised boxing broadcasts and, most lucratively, sold hamburger grills.</p><p>Foreman began endorsing the George Foreman Grill in 1994, with a big smile and predictable but still charming lines like “It’s a knockout.” The grills were electric and portable and could be used inside as an alternative to outdoor charcoal grilling. Foreman helped propel the grills to become an American kitchen mainstay.</p><p>In 1999, Salton Inc. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/10/business/salton-pays-137.5-million-for-george-foreman-s-name.html" title="">paid $137.5 million</a> for worldwide rights to use Foreman’s name on grills; Foreman got about 75 percent of the payout. He also endorsed mufflers, fried chicken and chips.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>Foreman’s affability helped him transcend boxing and cross over into the media world. In 1993-94, in the midst of his comeback, he starred in “George,” a short-lived sitcom on ABC in which he played a retired boxer helping troubled youth, and he made guest appearances on several other shows over the years. He appeared in a Venus-flytrap costume on “The Masked Singer” show in 2022 (his performance of “Get Ready” by the Temptations was not enough to stave off elimination).</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>George Foreman arriving for the world premiere of “Big George Foreman” in Los Angeles in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Tran/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>In 2005, Foreman collaborated with the author Fran Manushkin on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/10/books/arts/childrens-books-364312.html" title="">a children’s book</a> called “Let George Do It!” about a household full of Georges, like his own.</p><p>It reads: “‘Today is Big George’s birthday,’ Mom tells the assembled boys. ‘Can I count on all of you to help with the party?’</p><p>“‘You bet,’ said George, George, George and George. ‘Urgle,’ said Baby George.”</p><p>One key to Foreman’s business success in so many areas, he said, was making personal appearances.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>“That’s bigger than anything, any endorsement, I don’t care who you are,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/24/business/worldbusiness/24iht-24adco.14744277.html" title="">he said</a>. “They want to touch you; they want to know you.”</p><p>“Then,” he said, “they buy you.”</p><p>Hank Sanders<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Victor Mather, who has been a reporter and editor at The Times for 25 years, covers sports and breaking news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/victor-mather">More about Victor Mather</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
