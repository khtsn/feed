Dams have been damaged or breached, including in Stronie Slaskie, a southwestern town on the Morawka River, said Anna Szumanska, a spokeswoman for Poland’s infrastructure ministry. “Water began to flow uncontrolled,” she wrote in an email.</p><p>The ground is so saturated and the water levels are so high in some rivers that there is still a risk of further flooding, Mr. Blaszczyk said.</p><p>Polish officials were meeting on Monday to decide whether to declare a national disaster and Mr. Blaszczyk said that temporary shelters have been erected in schools and community centers.

Two older men also died, apparently after being trapped inside their homes, he said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The flooding has affected communities throughout the country, but “the most significant problems, damage, and flooding” are in Lower Austria, the state that surrounds Vienna, he said. </p><p>Vienna, which has about two million people, has also been hard hit. Public transit has been suspended or severely restricted, and the river “has become a raging torrent — normally, it carries only a few centimeters of water,” Mr. Eidenberger wrote.</p><p>Hundreds of people have been rescued from rooftops by helicopter. Mr. Eidenberger said that tens of thousands of volunteers had been deployed across the country, about 20,000 in Lower Austria alone.</p><p>Dams are still threatening to overflow. “That’s the most difficult situation right now,” said Markus Duerauer, a liaison officer of the Lower Austrian Fire Brigade Association.</p><p>And the <a href="https://www.wien.info/en/see-do/discover-vienna/webcam-379930" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rain is still coming down</a> hard. “Relief is not expected to come before tomorrow, and more likely, the day after,” Mr. Eidenberger wrote Monday morning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rescue workers helped a resident of Jesenik, Czech Republic, to safety on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gabriel Kuchta/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Judson Jones<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>10</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Thousands Are Displaced As Days of Deadly Floods Devastate Central Europe<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
