Jean-Louis Georgelin</a>, who prided himself on keeping the project on track.</p><p>“At the beginning — especially in the beginning — most people didn’t think that it was possible,” Mr. Jost said. “And he was very clear in his head, and with others, that we will do it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-202ad32c">Stabilizing the cathedral</h2><p>In 2019, when the flames were finally extinguished just before midnight after a five-hour battle, emergency workers were able to enter the cathedral and assess the damage.

Gables and statues were threatening to fall. The building had to be secured before any repairs could proceed, a process that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/18/world/europe/notre-dame-cathedral-restoration.html?searchResultPosition=10" title="">ended in 2021</a>.</p><p>“Our teams had to intervene within a very short time-frame, but with infinite precaution,” said Julien Le Bras, the chief executive of Le Bras Frères.

A forest of scaffolding over 80 feet high was assembled inside, allowing architects to assess normally inaccessible sections and helping prop up weakened vaults with wooden arches.</p><p>Workers also consolidated Notre-Dame’s 28 flying buttresses, a Middle Ages innovation that allowed for thinner walls and taller cathedrals. With the weight of the roof mostly gone, the buttresses were bolstered with eight-ton arches to prevent the walls from collapsing.</p><p>One of the biggest concerns was the 220-ton tangle of 40,000 steel scaffolding tubes that the flames had fused together — remnants of renovation on the spire that predated the fire and that were now threatening the structure.
