Over 15 months, Israel and Hamas repeatedly rejected proposals for peace. In that time, tens of thousands of Palestinians died. Israeli families grieved for loved ones held as hostages in Gaza. And people around the world protested against the conflict.</p><p>Yesterday, Israel and Hamas finally agreed to a truce. As part of a six-week cease-fire, Israel will withdraw from parts of Gaza and free hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas will release a third of the hostages it still holds. Officials hope the cease-fire will give way to a permanent peace, but that depends on whether both sides will work out thornier problems later.</p><p>Israel’s government still must ratify the agreement, but officials are treating it as complete. “We’re handing off to the next team a real opportunity for a brighter future in the Middle East,” President Biden said, referring to Donald Trump’s incoming administration. “I hope they take it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-26850960">What’s in the deal?</h2><p>The truce will go into effect on Sunday. Hamas will release 33 hostages in waves over six weeks. They’ll include women, children, men over age 50 and sick or wounded people. About 100 hostages remain in Gaza, although about 35 are believed to be dead.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Tel Aviv.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In exchange, Israel will release around 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. It will also have to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza.
