In doing so, Mr. Mulhall said, Mr. Musk voiced support for a neo-Nazi who has previously been a member of fascist groups.</p><p>Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The summer riots followed a deadly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/world/europe/southport-stabbing-uk-riots.html" title="">attack at a dance class in Southport</a> on July 29, in which a knife-wielding assailant killed three young girls and injured several others. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/09/technology/migrants-racism-social-media-violence.html" title="">Disinformation soon spread on social media</a>, claiming that the suspect, who was later identified as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/europe/southport-stabbings-suspect-axel-rudakubana.html" title="">Axel Rudakubana</a>, was a Syrian asylum seeker who had arrived on a small boat, when in fact he was born in Wales.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A memorial for the three young girls killed in the knife attack in Southport, England, last August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Testa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><a href="https://hopenothate.org.uk/2025/01/06/twisted-firestarter-southport-wake-up-founder-jailed-thanks-to-hope-not-hate-investigation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Research conducted by Hope Not Hate showed</a> that Mr. McIntyre used a Telegram account within hours of the Southport attack to call for violence and then created a TikTok account and Telegram channel to promote it, calling the latter ‚ÄúSouthport Wake Up.‚Äù He shared a post under a pseudonym in that Telegram channel encouraging a demonstration the next day on St. Luke‚Äôs Road in Southport, near the site of the knife attack, and drew a red circle around a mosque on that road. He added the message ‚Äútime for a üî•TIME FOR WAR.‚Äù</p><p>On July 30, a violent mob targeted the mosque that Mr. McIntyre had highlighted, and dozens of police officers were injured. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/world/europe/southport-stabbing-uk-riots.html" title="">Days of unrest</a> convulsed Britain over the next week, as rioters clashed with the police, lit cars on fire, attacked mosques and ransacked businesses.</p><p>Later, in piecing together various accounts run by Mr. McIntyre across social media and messaging platforms, Hope Not Hate found posts from him on Aug. 3, declaring that ‚ÄúThe mosques must burn,‚Äù and on Aug. 6, calling for the killing of all Jewish, Muslim and Black people, and adding: ‚ÄúWhite power.‚Äù</p><p>His extremism extended back years before the riots. Mr. McIntyre posted a selfie in July 2022 in which he gave a Nazi salute, and after his arrest, the police found a copy of ‚ÄúMein Kampf,‚Äù Hitler‚Äôs political manifesto, in his home.</p><p>The Merseyside Police, which oversee policing in the Liverpool area, said Mr. McIntyre‚Äôs messages on Telegram encouraged others to participate in violent disorder and cause criminal damage in Southport. He also made other ‚Äúfailed attempts to instigate disorder at other locations,‚Äù the police said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elon Musk, the billionaire tech mogul, bemoaned Mr. McIntyre‚Äôs sentencing in a post on his social media platform X, declaring: ‚ÄúOver 7 years prison for social media posts ‚Ä¶ Whoever gave that sentence deserves prison themselves.‚Äù</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alex Brandon/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. McIntyre took part in riots in Southport on July 30 and in Liverpool on Aug. 3, the police said, and had a knife when he was arrested on Aug. 8.</p><p>Paula Jones, a detective inspector with the Merseyside Police, said that Mr. McIntyre had played a key role in coordinating the July 30 riot, using social media to encourage people to travel to Southport and Liverpool to commit criminal damage.</p><p>Mr. McIntyre‚Äôs social media footprint included graphic threats of rape and violence against other users. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also a useful case study to understand the hypocrisy that sits at the center of Musk when it comes to discussing Britain,‚Äù Mr. Mulhall said. ‚ÄúOn one hand, Mr. Musk bemoans the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/world/europe/uk-grooming-gangs-elon-musk.html" title="">abuse of women through grooming gangs</a>, while simultaneously defending the rights of individuals to use social media to send rape threats and death threats to women.‚Äù</p><p>Mr. Musk‚Äôs decision to reinstate the once-banned accounts of other members of Britain‚Äôs far right, including Mr. Robinson, has significantly boosted their profile and helped spread extremist ideology, according to groups that monitor the far right. (Mr. Robinson is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/world/europe/tommy-robinson-sentenced-uk-far-right.html" title="">currently in prison for contempt of court</a>, though his account on X remains active, and supporters are posting in his stead.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Sophia Gaston, a British policy analyst and a visiting fellow at King‚Äôs College London, said that Mr. Musk‚Äôs focus on Britain aligned with broader scrutiny of the country by the MAGA movement. Mr. Musk has criticized the British government and authorities for efforts to combat hate speech and violent rhetoric, framing himself as a defender of free speech.</p><p>‚ÄúBut there is a difference between that amplification of voices outside of the mainstream of political life and giving a spotlight to those who have been convicted of criminal offenses,‚Äù Ms. Gaston said. ‚ÄúIn McIntyre‚Äôs case, these are not spurious laws around political correctness, which can be open to interpretation. These are laws around public disorder and violence, which are vital to protecting life and property.‚Äù</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Megan Specia reports on Britain, Ireland and the Ukraine war for The Times.
