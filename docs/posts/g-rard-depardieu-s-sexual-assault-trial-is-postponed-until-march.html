But he did not show up.</p><p>Two doctors had sent medical notices, presented by his lawyer, stating the actor was too unwell to attend. They said that he has had diabetes for over 25 years, as well as heart issues, having undergone a quadruple bypass, and that his condition had worsened because of anxiety around the trial.</p><p>The judge postponed the trial until March 24 and 25. He also ordered a doctor to conduct a medical examination of the actor and submit the conclusions to the court by March 4.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Depardieu faces two charges of sexual assault against two women on the set of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15167162/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Les Volets Verts,”</a> or “The Green Shutters,” a movie by the French director Jean Becker that was released in 2022.</p><p>In one case, the actor is accused of pinning the set decorator between his legs and then grabbing her buttocks, genitals and breasts over her clothing, while making obscene gestures and speaking with vulgarities. In the other, he is charged with twice grabbing the buttocks of an assistant director and, another time, touching her breasts.</p><p>If convicted, Mr. Depardieu would face up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros, or just over $80,000.</p><p>Mr. Depardieu, 75, has denied all the allegations. In court on Monday, his lawyer, Jérémie Assous, repeatedly called the accusations untrue and demanded that the police investigation be reopened to include witnesses who would substantiate Mr. Depardieu’s position.</p><p>The judge declined to reopen the pretrial investigation but said the defense could bring any witness it wanted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>A crowd of about 100 activists had gathered outside the courthouse in northern Paris, holding signs that read, “Victims, we believe you” and “A monster of cinema.” Many said they were disappointed that the trial was being postponed.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters gathered outside the court building in Paris on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Geoffroy Van Der Hasselt/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“They talk a lot about the trial by social media as scandalous, but when they’re summoned to the real trial, they don’t show up,” said Blanche Sabbah, 29, a cartoonist, who was among the crowd. She added that postponing the trial would make things even more difficult for the victims. </p><p>“In everything I heard there were so many lies,” one of the two plaintiffs told journalists on her way out the courtroom. “Almost everything was lies, actually.” She added, I hope he will have the courage to show up, because we showed up.”</p><p>For many in France, the case represents a breakthrough for the country’s #MeToo movement after years of relative inaction, particularly in the movie industry, where Mr. Depardieu is idolized and powerful.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The actor has dominated the French screen for decades, appearing in more than 200 films, including “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/16/movies/review-film-depardieu-as-the-blustery-yet-wistful-cyrano-de-bergerac.html" title="">Cyrano de Bergerac</a>” and “<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/film/031398iron-film-review.html" title="">The Man in the Iron Mask</a>.” He has also faced a long string of accusations of sexual assault since #MeToo first erupted in France in 2017.</p><p>Some 20 women have accused him of sexually assaulting them. At least six have filed complaints with the police, although two were dropped because they exceeded the statute of limitations.</p><p>The case postponed on Monday was the first against him that was scheduled to go to court.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
