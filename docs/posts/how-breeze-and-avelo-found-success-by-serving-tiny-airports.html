Inside the airport, a new, second-floor bar was crowded as passengers on the floor below walked through a gate into one of three waiting planes.</p><p>Five years ago, Tweed-New Haven Airport would have been much quieter. Back then, it hosted about a half-dozen daily flights, mostly short American Airlines jaunts to and from Philadelphia. This month, about 30 flights a day were connecting the airport to more than two dozen destinations.</p><p>The revitalization of this airport, which sits close to Long Island Sound, is a consequence of long-running industry changes that created an opportunity for a pair of start-up airlines — Avelo Airlines and Breeze Airways — to fly from airports that the country’s biggest carriers have largely neglected.</p><p>“What we’re really seeing here is the next generation of industry structure and evolution,” said John Strong, a business professor at the College of William &amp; Mary who focuses on the airline industry.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Aviation is unforgiving. Competition is fierce, the barriers to entry are high and success is fragile. After decades of consolidation, four large airlines control two-thirds of domestic air travel. Most of their flights take off or land at large airports, which has made their operations efficient and generally profitable. But over time, the big airlines trimmed service at smaller airports.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Avelo has reported profits for several quarters.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christopher Capozziello for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>That created an opening for Avelo and Breeze. Both started flying in the spring of 2021, with networks and planes suited to underused airports. The airlines mainly fly nonstop between destinations, often providing direct service where none existed before. That differs from the hub-and-spoke model favored by larger airlines, which route flights from smaller airports through big, central hubs in cities like Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas. Avelo and Breeze also fly small- to medium-size planes with plenty of seats, but not so many that the two airlines might regularly struggle to fill them.</p><p>“It’s just about the economics,” Lukas Johnson, the chief commercial officer at Breeze, said. “You’re kind of Goldilocks. You’re the right size, for the right model, for the right price and efficiency. And that’s really where we’ve carved out a niche.”</p><p>The big question is: Can Avelo and Breeze sustain their growth? The history of airlines is littered with bankruptcies and failures. Profits on routes between smaller airports can be modest, and demand can disappear quickly during recessions or when costs of fuel or labor rise and airlines increase ticket prices or adjust service.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Industry experts say that for now, the two airlines, which are privately owned, appear to be doing well. Both have earned loyal followings and have kept costs low and service reliable.</p><p>Breeze reported its first monthly profit this year and aims to be profitable for all of 2025. Avelo has reported several quarterly profits, and its chief executive, Andrew Levy, said he expected the airline to break even this year — or be close to doing so — with over $300 million in revenue.</p><p>“It’s not about what kind of food am I getting or what’s the lounge like,” he said. “What really matters is give me a good deal and just get me there on time. And we excel at that.”</p><p>Breeze and Avelo are broadly similar. Both mainly serve people traveling for fun or to visit family and friends. They often fly routes that few or no other airlines operate on — for example, from New Haven, Avelo flies to cities like Knoxville, Tenn., and San Juan, P.R., while Breeze offers flights between Erie, Pa., and Orlando, Fla.; Hartford, Conn.; and Wilmington, N.C.</p><p>Both companies were also founded by industry veterans — Breeze by David Neeleman, the entrepreneur behind JetBlue Airways, and Avelo by Mr. Levy, a former top executive at United Airlines and Allegiant Air.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>But the airlines are also different in some ways. Avelo offers cheap fares and few perks. There are no change or cancellation fees, but also no Wi-Fi, power outlets, snacks or drinks for sale. Breeze offers more choice, including options that tap into the growing demand for premium travel after the pandemic, with different seating classes, name-brand snacks and drinks, Wi-Fi, and power outlets. Avelo flies an older generation of the Boeing 737, while Breeze is moving to a fleet entirely made up of the Airbus A220, a smaller jet.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Avelo flies an older generation of the Boeing 737, while Breeze is moving to a fleet entirely made up of the smaller Airbus A220.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christopher Capozziello for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>And despite their budding rivalry in New Haven, where Avelo is dominant, the airlines hardly compete head to head. Avelo mainly operates up and down the East and West Coasts. Breeze has twice as many flights, including some across the country, according to Cirium, an aviation data firm that tracks flight schedules. Together, the airlines flew about 325 routes this year, but competed on only eight.</p><p>“They both have a unique product, a different product,” said Michael Boyd, an aviation consultant with the Boyd Group International. Still, he added: “The head offices of those two companies probably aren’t exchanging holiday cards.”</p><p>Avelo and Breeze have given hope to some airports and cities that have lost flights in recent years. American Airlines, which did not respond to a request for comment, pulled out of Tweed in late 2021, leaving the airport with no commercial airline until Avelo arrived a few weeks later.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Almost every day, I have a conversation with some resident who’s excited that they could visit their relatives or go on a weekend trip to Florida,” said Mayor Justin Elicker of New Haven.</p><p>The airport and the two airlines support hundreds of local jobs, and the flights have increased tourism and connected New Haven’s thriving life sciences sector, which has strong ties to Yale University, with other cities that have similar hubs, he said.</p><p>For Mia Whitfield, the benefits have been personal. She flies Avelo frequently from Nashville to New Haven to visit her boyfriend, who recently moved to the area. She has taken more than a half-dozen Avelo flights between the cities this year, saving hours on trips from other airlines that require connecting flights and long drives from airports in Hartford or Providence, R.I.</p><p>“It’s no-frills, but it’s what you need it to be,” Ms. Whitfield said. “We’re just really grateful to have the option. It gives us more time together at the end of the day.”</p><p>The airport’s small size makes it easy to quickly get in, move through security and onto your flight, she said. But there are drawbacks: The one-room arrival terminal can get crowded quickly, and traffic can get backed up during peak times, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>The traffic, noise and other environmental concerns have frustrated some residents. City and airport officials say they are working on ways to spread out traffic, and the airlines have avoided flying early and late in the day.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Breeze and Avelo both appear to be doing well for now, analysts say. “It’s no-frills, but it’s what you need it to be,” one frequent flier on Avelo said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christopher Capozziello for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Community members and neighboring East Haven, on whose land the airport also sits, have taken issue with plans to extend the airport’s runways and build a new terminal. Save the Sound, an environmental nonprofit, recently asked a federal court to require the Federal Aviation Administration to rework an analysis of the environmental impact of the new terminal, citing concerns that it would negatively affect air quality, flooding and noise.</p><p>“There are huge environmental consequences, and they really failed to meaningfully explore these,” said Roger Reynolds, the nonprofit’s senior legal director.</p><p>But proponents of the terminal, which the F.A.A. has approved, said it would help to better handle the influx of traffic, people and flights. Jorge Roberts, the chief executive of AvPorts, which is building that terminal and runs the existing one in a converted hangar, said the effort had been underway since he visited the airport before the pandemic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“I said, ‘You have a gold mine here,’” he said. “The data is showing us there’s an underserved market.”</p><p>Avelo, which flies from 54 airports, says it has served more than 2.8 million passengers out of New Haven. Tweed was home to more than one in five scheduled Avelo flights this year, according to Cirium data. That’s twice as many as the airline flew from its second-largest hub, Hollywood Burbank Airport near Los Angeles.</p><p>Breeze serves 66 airports, including some near New Haven. It connects Hartford to more than two dozen destinations, and flies from Providence as well as Long Island and White Plains in New York. The airline will operate only a few dozen flights in New Haven in December, but plans to fly a few dozen a week in February.</p><p>Analysts say there is room for both companies in the airline industry, though they could be vulnerable if the economy suffers a sharp downturn.</p><p>“It depends on how spending changes,” Mr. Boyd said. “When discretionary dollars go away, discretionary flying goes away.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Niraj Chokshi writes about aviation, rail and other transportation industries.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/niraj-chokshi">More about Niraj Chokshi</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/25/business/avelo-breeze-small-airports.html">14</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/25/business/avelo-breeze-small-airports.html">14</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The C.E.O.s Are Tripping: </strong>There is a growing cottage industry dedicated to the theory that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/business/psychedelic-retreats-ceos.html">psychedelic drugs can improve business leadership</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>What Is Venture Capital Now?: </strong>The opposing paths taken by two powerful firms <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/technology/andreessen-horowitz-benchmark-venture-capital.html">embody a profound debate</a> about the future of an industry that funds and fosters American innovation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dodging $8 Billion in Taxes: </strong>Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia and one of the world’s richest men, has taken advantage of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/business/nvidia-jensen-huang-estate-taxes.html">popular loopholes in the federal estate and gift taxes</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>An Alternate Reality: </strong>For one week, our reporter traded his news apps for Rumble, the right-wing alternative to YouTube. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/13/business/rumble-trump-bongino-kirk.html">Here’s what he saw</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>San Francisco’s Chatbot Crush: </strong>A.I. insiders are falling for Claude, a chatbot from Anthropic.
