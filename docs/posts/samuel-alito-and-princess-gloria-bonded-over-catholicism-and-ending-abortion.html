It was a chilly autumn night in Bavaria, with rain spitting outside, as she arrived at the chapel to pray.</p><p>The room glowed red, lit from a crypt below where her husband and other family members lay in their coffins. The princess knelt and soft bells sounded. Her dinner guests, a British baroness and her husband, slipped in to join her as a priest led prayers.</p><p>Princess Gloria, 64, who burst onto the international scene in the 1980s in <a href="https://www.tatler.com/article/princess-gloria-von-thurn-und-taxis-style-tiara" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">jeweled tiaras</a> and a multicolored mohawk, has since evolved into a conservative Catholic with ties to the European far right. An anti-abortion and anti-immigration provocateur in her native Germany, she has welcomed a newcomer into her circle as a hero: Justice Samuel A.

It was a conservative Catholicism, more aligned with Pope Benedict than the more liberal views of Pope Francis.

It was in Rome that she met Justice Alito, at a Catholic conference. They were introduced over drinks by a mutual acquaintance, Father Thomas Joseph White, an American convert to Catholicism and an avid bluegrass banjoist.

But she immediately liked him and especially his wife, Martha-Ann, whom she described as “very fun, bubbly.” She quickly extended an invitation to her festival.</p><p>“If I meet people and I like them, I will immediately invite them to come,” she said. “I have admiration and great respect for the judge, and I have respect for his wife, who is the manager behind a man.”</p><p>She and the justice kept in touch.

Meals and lodging at the palace were covered by the princess.

It is not clear how long the Alitos spent at the palace.</p><p>“It was a great honor for us that he accepted the invitation,” Princess Gloria said. “Of course I didn’t charge him any expenses.
