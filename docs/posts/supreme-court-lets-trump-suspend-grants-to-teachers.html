    <h1>Supreme Court Lets Trump Suspend Grants to Teachers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In February, the Education Department sent grant recipients boilerplate form letters ending the funding, saying the programs “fail to serve the best interests of the United States” by taking account of factors other than “merit, fairness and excellence,” and by allowing waste and fraud.</p><p>Eight states, including California and New York, <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/state-of-california-et-al-v-united-states-department-of-education-complaint-2025.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sued</a> to stop the cuts, arguing that they would undermine both urban and rural school districts, requiring them to hire “long-term substitutes, teachers with emergency credentials and unlicensed teachers on waivers.”</p><p>Judge Myong J. Joun of the Federal District Court in Massachusetts <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.281668/gov.uscourts.mad.281668.41.0_1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">temporarily ordered</a> the grants to remain available while he considered the lawsuit. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, <a href="https://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/sites/ca1/files/opnfiles/25-1244P-01A.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rejected a request</a> from the Trump administration to undo Judge Joun’s order, saying the government’s arguments were based on “speculation and hyperbole.”</p><p>In temporarily blocking the cancellation of the grants, Judge Joun said that he sought to maintain the status quo. He wrote that if he failed to do so, “dozens of programs upon which public schools, public universities, students, teachers and faculty rely will be gutted.” On the other hand, he reasoned, if he did pause the Trump administration action, the groups would merely continue to receive funds that had been appropriated by Congress.</p><p>In its brief order, the court said that the challengers had “not refuted” the Trump administration’s claim that “it is unlikely to recover the grant funds once they are disbursed.” By contrast, the order stated, “the government compellingly argues that respondents would not suffer irreparable harm” while the grants are paused. The court said it had relied on statements by the challengers that “they have the financial wherewithal to keep their programs running.”</p></div></div>
