Michael Waltz is one of them. He shares his name, there’s a picture of him, and all of his contacts up on Venmo. Even Matt Gaetz was, like, ‘How could you be so careless?’” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“And security issues aside, isn’t it a little bit disturbing that a guy overseeing our national defense, our weapons — our nuclear weapons — is still in the ‘Dude, you owe me $14 for tacos’ phase of his life?” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“He’s Venmo-ing his doctor? My man, if your doctor takes Venmo, that ain’t a doctor.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“This story won’t be going away anytime soon, because Mike Waltz has made a key strategic error: being an idiot everywhere at all times.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“Because of how incredibly sloppy they are, a German newspaper, Der Spiegel, was able to find personal email addresses, phone numbers and passwords — some of which seem to be still in use — for Mike Waltz, Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Hegseth. What a group. We have a national security adviser who doesn’t know how to secure, a defensive secretary of defense, a pro-measles secretary of health, and a secretary of education who wants to close the Department of Education.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, she’s standing firm. She said today the administration has been ‘incredibly transparent about this entire situation.’ Yeah, that’s the problem — they’ve been so transparent, we’ve seen all their information.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Pete Hegseth and Mike Waltz have said and done so many stupid things this week, Trump might have to start calling them Eric and Don Jr.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-105672b8">The Punchiest Punchlines (McRib Edition)</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“Of course, everyone’s still talking to me about the White House’s group chat scandal, but I saw that Trump said it’s ‘really not a big deal.’ That’s a relief.
