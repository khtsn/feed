It led his office to announce he had suspended the release of more than 100 Palestinian prisoners as called for under the truce brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the United States.</p><p>The episode briefly cast doubt on whether the prisoner release would happen at all.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu blasted the “shocking scenes” of crowds yelling and jostling to get nearer to a fearful-looking Ms. Yehud and a grim-looking Mr. Moses. “This is additional proof of the inconceivable brutality of the Hamas terrorist organization,” the Israel prime minister said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>He called on the international mediators to secure guarantees from Hamas for “the safe exit of our hostages in the next rounds.” The Israeli government later relented, releasing the imprisoned Palestinians, saying that mediators had promised safe passage for hostages in future exchanges.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People gathering in Tel Aviv to watch the release of the hostages on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In a statement, Hamas said that the turnout of the crowds for the hostage handovers showed that Palestinians were determined to remain on their land. To Israelis, the chaos illustrated Hamas’s desire to humiliate and torment the hostages even as they were being freed.</p><p>In previous handovers, the militants have driven hostages into jubilant, sometimes jeering crowds before transferring them to Red Cross officials, who then handed them to Israeli officials.</p><p>In addition to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/world/middleeast/israeli-hostages-released-arbel-yehud-agam-berger-gadi-moses.html" title="">three Israeli hostages</a>, Hamas on Thursday freed five Thai agricultural workers who were among those abducted when the militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. They were Pongsak Thanna, Sathian Suwannakham, Watchara Sriaoun, Bannawat Seathao and Surasak Lamnao​. The fate of one remaining Thai hostage, Nattapong Pinta, remained unclear.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The exchanges came during the first phase of a provisional cease-fire lasting 42 days, and Israel and Hamas still have to negotiate the next one.</p><p>Before the hostages were freed in Khan Younis on Thursday, large numbers of Palestinians gathered near the home of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza who was killed by Israel in October. A small white van carrying the captives and surrounded by armed gunmen slowly pushed its way through the yelling crowds.</p><p>Photos and video footage show Ms. Yehud, one of the last living female hostages to be held in Gaza, walking cautiously through the throngs while surrounded by rifle-wielding militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad as they made their way toward a Red Cross convoy. The Red Cross handed Ms. Yehud over to Israeli soldiers.</p><p>The third freed Israeli hostage, Mr. Moses, was also forced to wend his way through a tight crowd of spectators.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gadi Moses, 80, being escorted by Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters through a crowd of spectators in the Gazan city of Khan Younis on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jehad Alshrafi/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Yves Daccord, a former director general of the Red Cross, said the handovers in Khan Younis were “risky,” “unacceptable” and “absolutely psychological torture.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Releasing hostages in this way creates an enormous trauma on top of everything that has already happened,” he said in an interview. Ideally, he said, hostages should be released away from crowds and cameras.</p><p>After her release, Ms. Yehud was taken to Sheba Hospital in the city of Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv. She was met with crowds in Israel, too, but they were welcoming. “Our life’s mission to bring Arbel back to us has succeeded,” her family said in a statement.</p><p>Ms. Yehud was 28 when she was <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/taken-captive-arbel-yehud-third-generation-on-kibbutz-nir-oz/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">taken hostage</a> along with her boyfriend<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/taken-captive-arbel-yehud-third-generation-on-kibbutz-nir-oz/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">,</a> Ariel Cunio, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel. Mr. Cunio is believed to still be a captive in Gaza. Ms. Yehud’s brother, Dolev Yehud, a medic, was identified <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/taken-captive-siblings-dolev-arbel-yehud-deep-roots-at-kibbutz/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">last year</a> as having been killed during the Hamas-led attack.</p><p>In a statement posted by the Hostage Families Forum, an umbrella organization, Ms. Yehud’s family urged Israeli officials to pursue the cease-fire agreement until all hostages were released. “Everyone must be brought home immediately so that we can heal as a society,” it said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Ms. Berger, the soldier returned home from northern Gaza, was in “good” condition, according to Dr. Eytan Wirtheim, the chief executive of Beilinson Hospital, where she was taken.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A helicopter carrying Ms. Yehud to Sheba Hospital in Ramat Gan, Israel, on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>She had been 19 and serving as a lookout at the Nahal Oz army base near the border with Gaza when the Hamas-led militants stormed the facility, killing more than 50 soldiers and abducting her and six other soldiers. Four of them were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hostages.html" title="">released in an exchange</a> on Saturday.</p><p>Those four soldiers have been “improving from day to day” in the hospital, Dr. Wirtheim said in a televised statement. He said they had decided to stay in the hospital to keep Ms. Berger company during her first days of freedom.</p><p>Mr. Moses, a farming expert, was 79 when he was abducted in Kibbutz Nir Oz after trying to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-father-kidnap.html" title="">reason with the marauding militants</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>His partner, Efrat Katz, had hidden inside a safe room in their home with her daughter and two visiting grandchildren, until they, too, were taken. Their kidnapping was captured on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-father-kidnap.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">a video</a> that showed them squashed together in the back of a pickup.</p><p>Ms. Katz was killed when an Israeli helicopter responding to the attack fired on the vehicle. Her daughter and grandchildren were released in November 2023.</p><p>The freed Thai men underwent initial medical examinations on Thursday and were found to be in “good” condition, a spokesman for Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said in a statement. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Watchara Sriaoun, a Thai national who was held hostage in Gaza, speaking on a video call to his family and friends in Thailand on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lillian Suwanrumpha/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Vilas Thanna, the father of Mr. Pongsak, who worked on a fruit farm, could barely get the words out as he digested the news of his son’s freedom “When we are happy, we cry,” he said. “When we are sad, we also cry. But these are happy tears.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Economic hardship has spurred thousands of Thais, particularly from the Isaan region of northeastern Thailand, to take agricultural jobs in Israel. Thai farmhands working in Israel suffered a heavy toll in the 2023 Hamas-led attacks. At least 39 were killed and at least 31 taken hostage, according to the Thai Foreign Ministry.</p><p>Twenty-three of them were released in November 2023. Two others died in captivity, the Foreign Ministry said last May. </p><p>Hamas had pledged to free at least 33 hostages in exchange for more than 1,500 Palestinian prisoners during the cease-fire’s first phase. On Thursday, Israel released 110 Palestinian prisoners, including 32 serving life sentences for deadly attacks against Israelis.</p><p>Before the releases, Palestinians stood outside a government recreation center in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Thursday, restlessly checking their phones for updates on the prisoners.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinian prisoners being greeted by families and well-wishers in Ramallah on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nasser Nasser/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Samar Faisal stood in the crisp winter air, shivering as much from excitement as the cold. She was in disbelief, she said. After more than 20 years in an Israeli prison, her brother was being released.</p><p>“I’m anxious and praying for the moment I finally see him,” Ms. Faisal said, as volunteers in fluorescent vests moved through the crowd.</p><p>For some waiting outside the recreation center, anticipation was tempered by sorrow.</p><p>Alaa Zubeidi was dressed in black in memory of her eldest son, Mohamed, who she said had been killed by an Israeli drone strike in September in their hometown, Jenin. Now, she was awaiting the release of her husband, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/world/middleeast/zakaria-zubeidi-release-israel-hamas.html?smid=url-share" title="">Zakariya Zubeidi</a>, who over the past two decades has been a militant, a theater director and an escaped prisoner. Israeli forces recaptured him in 2019.</p><p>Finally, around 7 p.m., a chain of buses arrived, carrying dozens of former Palestinian prisoners. Sixty-seven arrived in Ramallah on Thursday, including 27 children, officials said. An additional 14 Palestinians arrived in Jerusalem and nine in Gaza, while 20 were sent to Egypt.</p><p>In Beitunia, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, as Red Cross buses carrying freed Palestinian prisoners arrived, Palestinians hurled stones at Israeli forces, who fired stun grenades in response, footage live-streamed on Arabic television networks showed. It was unclear if there were any casualties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>The exchanges were the third swap in the first phase in the 42-day truce that halted the fighting between Hamas and Israel.
