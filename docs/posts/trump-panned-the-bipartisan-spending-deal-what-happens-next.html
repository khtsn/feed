    <h1>Trump Panned the Bipartisan Spending Deal. What Happens Next?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>That demand was an acknowledgment of the challenges Mr. Trump and Republican leaders are likely to face trying to wrangle a thin Republican majority in Congress to approve an increase in the national debt, something that many in the party have long refused to do.</p><p>“Increasing the debt ceiling is not great but we’d rather do it on Biden’s watch,” Mr. Trump said on social media, adding that Democrats “are looking to embarrass us in June when it comes up for a Vote.” Any Republican who “would be so stupid” as to vote for a spending bill that didn’t also immediately eliminate or raise the debt ceiling, Mr. Trump said, would face a primary challenge.</p><h3 id="link-268430fb"><span>What’s in the bill</span></h3><p>The spending legislation that had been hammered out by congressional leaders this week would extend funding of the government at current levels until the middle of March, averting a government shutdown until after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, when Republicans would also be in control of a new Congress.</p><p>But by the time the agreement had been unveiled to lawmakers, the bill was filled with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/us/politics/spending-bill-explainer.html?smid=url-share" title="">number of unrelated measures</a>, including $100 billion in new disaster aid, $10 billion in additional economic assistance to farmers; changes in health, energy and foreign investment policies; a pay raise for members of Congress; and a provision granting a stadium site in the nation’s capital for the Washington Commanders football team.</p><p>Republican lawmakers had already begun to balk at the details of the 1,547-page spending package before Mr. Trump intervened, explicitly threatening Republicans who might support the bill with political retribution.</p><p>Elon Musk, the billionaire Mr. Trump has put in charge of a sweeping initiative to scale back government and slash spending, spent Wednesday attacking the legislation on X, his social media platform, and exhorting G.O.P. lawmakers to oppose it.</p></div></div>
