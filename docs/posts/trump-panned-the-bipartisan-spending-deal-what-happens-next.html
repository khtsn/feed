Trump denounced a bipartisan spending deal that would fund the government until mid-March, telling Republican lawmakers that it would be “suicidal” to vote for it. His intervention all but buried the agreement with government funding scheduled to lapse in less than two days.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s criticism of the legislation, delivered in a series of social media posts on Wednesday, fueled a conservative revolt that had already been underway against the spending measure. His broadside left the measure on life support in the House, as he demanded major changes to the deal that threw negotiations to avoid a government shutdown into chaos.</p><p>Here’s what to know:</p><h3 id="link-637e7577"><span>What happens next</span></h3><p>Congress has until Friday night to come up with and pass a bill that can clear the Republican-led House and the Democratic-controlled Senate and be signed by President Biden before government funding lapses at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. It is unclear what form a new agreement would take.</p><p>Speaker Mike Johnson had planned to bring up the compromise bill under a fast-track process that requires a two-thirds majority for passage, relying on Democrats and a smaller group of Republicans to push it through. Now he must cobble together a majority some other way.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Some Republicans said Mr. Johnson was mulling shearing the legislation of a variety of unrelated measures that had been included and putting just the spending extension to a vote. But Democrats would be unlikely to support such a bill. They said Wednesday night that they were in no mood to negotiate a second deal after Mr. Trump directed Republicans to tank the one Mr. Johnson agreed to.</p><p>“House Republicans have now unilaterally decided to break a bipartisan agreement that they made,” Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said on Wednesday evening.</p><p>And some House Republicans are unwilling to vote for catchall spending measures, meaning that Democratic support will probably be needed to get any extension through the chamber. The demands Mr. Trump laid out for the legislation also further complicated the negotiations.</p><h3 id="link-3b49d01c"><span>What Trump wants</span></h3><p>In his social media posts, Mr. Trump called for removing everything from the spending bill but the funding extension, characterizing the many policy add-ons as “DEMOCRAT GIVEAWAYS” even though Republicans agreed to all of them.</p><p>He also demanded that the spending agreement address the debt ceiling so that the government borrowing limit would be increased while President Biden was in office, absolving him and Republicans of responsibility for doing so.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>That demand was an acknowledgment of the challenges Mr. Trump and Republican leaders are likely to face trying to wrangle a thin Republican majority in Congress to approve an increase in the national debt, something that many in the party have long refused to do.</p><p>“Increasing the debt ceiling is not great but we’d rather do it on Biden’s watch,” Mr. Trump said on social media, adding that Democrats “are looking to embarrass us in June when it comes up for a Vote.” Any Republican who “would be so stupid” as to vote for a spending bill that didn’t also immediately eliminate or raise the debt ceiling, Mr. Trump said, would face a primary challenge.</p><h3 id="link-268430fb"><span>What’s in the bill</span></h3><p>The spending legislation that had been hammered out by congressional leaders this week would extend funding of the government at current levels until the middle of March, averting a government shutdown until after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, when Republicans would also be in control of a new Congress.</p><p>But by the time the agreement had been unveiled to lawmakers, the bill was filled with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/us/politics/spending-bill-explainer.html?smid=url-share" title="">number of unrelated measures</a>, including $100 billion in new disaster aid, $10 billion in additional economic assistance to farmers; changes in health, energy and foreign investment policies; a pay raise for members of Congress; and a provision granting a stadium site in the nation’s capital for the Washington Commanders football team.</p><p>Republican lawmakers had already begun to balk at the details of the 1,547-page spending package before Mr. Trump intervened, explicitly threatening Republicans who might support the bill with political retribution.</p><p>Elon Musk, the billionaire Mr. Trump has put in charge of a sweeping initiative to scale back government and slash spending, spent Wednesday attacking the legislation on X, his social media platform, and exhorting G.O.P. lawmakers to oppose it.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Trump Transition: News and Analysis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Europe’s Leadership Vacuum:</strong> With Germany and France both in political turmoil, President-elect Donald Trump’s new administration will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/world/europe/europe-has-a-leadership-vacuum-how-will-it-handle-trump.html">begin at a time of instability for the continent</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Murky Economic Outlook:</strong> The U.S. economy is finally stable, but Trump’s proposals on tariffs, immigration, taxes and deregulation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/business/economy/trump-us-economy.html">may have far-reaching and contradictory effects</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Threats to the Media:</strong> Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/us/politics/trump-sues-des-moines-register.html">sued The Des Moines Register</a> for running a poll before the election that showed him trailing Vice President Kamala Harris, escalating his threats to seek retribution against the mainstream media.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kennedy on the Polio Vaccine:</strong> Robert F.
