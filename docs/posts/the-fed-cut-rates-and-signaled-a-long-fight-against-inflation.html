They also shook up financial markets by forecasting notably higher inflation and two fewer rate cuts in 2025 than they had previously expected.</p><p>Stock markets <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/business/stock-market-fed-rate-cut-forecast.html" title="">dropped after the Fed announced its projections</a>. The S&amp;P 500 fell nearly 3 percent, its worst day since the beginning of August.</p><p>Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said that the central bank cut rates after each of its last three meetings because inflation had significantly slowed, but that it was a “closer call” this time. He added that he expects the Fed to cut interest rates more slowly next year, because inflation appears to be lingering.</p><p><strong>For more: </strong>Donald Trump’s vows to cut taxes, impose high tariffs and crack down on immigration have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/business/economy/trump-us-economy.html" title="">added uncertainty to the economic forecasts</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-668ad2fe">The Supreme Court agreed to weigh in on the TikTok ban</h2><p>The Supreme Court agreed today <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/us/politics/supreme-court-tiktok-ban.html" title="">to hear TikTok’s challenge</a> to a law that could ban the popular video app in the U.S. The justices set aside two hours for the argument on Jan. 10, an exceptionally fast track that could result in a ruling before the ban is set to go into effect on Jan. 19.</p><p>“The court seems to recognize the gravity of banning an app used by 170 million Americans,” my colleague Sapna Maheshwari, who reports on TikTok, told me.</p><p>The law calls for TikTok to face a ban in the U.S. unless it is sold to a non-Chinese company. ByteDance, its parent company, argues that the law violates the First Amendment. The Biden administration argues that the law is necessary for national security reasons.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>In related news, </strong>the court also agreed to consider whether South Carolina can eliminate Medicaid funding for any services offered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/us/supreme-court-abortion-south-carolina-planned-parenthood.html" title="">by Planned Parenthood</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former Representative Matt Gaetz at the Capitol in September.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-2794be12">House ethics panel voted to release the Gaetz report</h2><p>The House Ethics Committee secretly voted this month to release an investigative report into the conduct <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/us/politics/matt-gaetz-ethics-report-release.html" title="">of former Representative Matt Gaetz</a>, Trump’s initial pick to run the Justice Department. </p><p>Gaetz dropped his bid to become attorney general after the weight of allegations of sex trafficking and drug use made it clear he would not be confirmed by the Senate.

Judy Garland first performed it during the 1944 musical film “Meet Me in St. Louis,” only after the lyrics were softened at her request. The song was far from the movie’s biggest hit.</p><p>But the tune endured, thanks in part to Frank Sinatra, who altered the lyrics again in 1957 to give it a cheerier postwar sheen. In recent decades, countless chart-topping artists recorded their own versions of the song — cementing its spot <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/arts/music/judy-garland-have-yourself-merry-little-christmas-song.html" title="">in the holiday canon</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p><strong>We’re asking readers</strong>: What’s the tradition, old or new, that you’re most looking forward to this year?
