Air-defense teams destroyed more than 140 targets, but at least five civilians were killed, officials said.</p><p>“The enemy’s target was our energy infrastructure throughout Ukraine,” Mr. Zelensky said. “Unfortunately, there is damage to objects from hits and falling debris.”</p><p>Interceptor missiles could be seen streaking across the blue skies over the capital, leaving trails of smoke as they raced to meet incoming missiles, and exploding in thunderous claps. Similar scenes played out across Ukraine, Ukrainian officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Russia used a combination of missiles fired from bombers, warships and land-based systems as well as swarms of drones from multiple directions. Ukraine has long expected a renewed attempt to collapse its energy grid, and it has come just as winter begins to bite.</p><p>Ukrainian officials said the attack was the latest demonstration that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was not interested in peace but remained bent on the destruction of the Ukrainian state.</p><p>Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said <a href="https://x.com/andrii_sybiha/status/1858028301219987877" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement</a> that the attack represented Mr. Putin’s “true response” to calls for peace. The minister added: “We need peace through strength, not appeasement.”</p><p>Precautionary emergency blackouts were announced across the country. The extent of the damage was not immediately clear as explosions were reported in nearly every region.</p><p>Two railway workers were killed in the Dnipro region and at least two people were killed in the port city of Mykolaiv, local officials said. Fires were reported in Lviv after debris crashed into a garage, killing one person. Two people injured by falling debris in Kyiv were hospitalized. In Odesa, all electrically powered transit was suspended.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The toll could rise, Ukrainian officials said.</p><p>The bombardment followed months of nightly attacks by long-range drones, an effort to wear down Ukrainian air defenses and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drones.html" title="">terrorize civilians</a>.</p><p>Before Sunday’s attacks, the United Nations warned that Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure could result in further mass displacement and deepen suffering for millions.</p><p>“If they were to target the energy sector again, this could be a tipping point,” Matthias Schmale, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Ukraine, said on Friday.</p><p>Since the war began nearly 1,000 days ago, more than six million Ukrainians have been forced to leave the country, and 3.6 million have become internally displaced, the United Nations says.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sheltering at a metro station during a Russian attack in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alina Smutko/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Nearly 40 percent of Ukraine’s population is in need of humanitarian assistance, it says.</p><p>Years of relentless attacks have destroyed around 65 percent of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, leaving Ukraine even more vulnerable this winter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Because Ukrainian cities have centralized systems for water, sewage and heating, power cuts put all those basic services at risk.</p><p>Ukrainian engineers and electricians have been working to restore damaged energy facilities. But if attacks cause extensive damage, officials have warned that there could be prolonged and extensive blackouts.</p><p>The renewed assault on the power grid and nightly drone attacks come as Ukrainian forces struggle to slow Russian advances in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky acknowledged the difficult situation in a radio interview broadcast on Saturday with the Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“There is slow, but nonetheless ongoing pressure and Russian advancement.” he said. “For various reasons: filling our brigades with trained personnel, equipping and supplying brigades with weapons — these processes have been quite slow.”</p><p>He said the war “will end faster with the policy” of the incoming Trump administration but cautioned that Ukraine needed to strengthen its position on the battlefield to have a chance of negotiating a just and lasting peace.</p><p>President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to bring the war to a quick end without saying how. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump and some of his most vocal supporters cast doubt on his commitment to supporting Ukraine, leading to speculation that he might try to pressure Ukraine to surrender to the Kremlin’s demands by withholding military aid.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky has said he has yet to hear anything of the sort from Mr. Trump, and has also repeatedly said that he sees no indication that Russia would be wiling to negotiate in good faith.</p><p>“I don’t think Putin wants peace at all,” he told Suspilne.</p><p>While the Russian leader might like to sit down with other world leaders for “talks,” he said, that was mainly a method of breaking the political isolation he has faced since the beginning of the war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“It benefits him to sit down, talk, and not reach an agreement,” Mr. Zelensky said.</p><p>With the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/us/politics/boris-epshteyn-trump.html" title="">considering appointing a special envoy</a> to mediate talks between Russia and Ukraine, Mr. Zelensky said it was important that America continue to recognize Russia as the aggressor.</p><p>“You can’t speak abstractly, ‘I’m a mediator, so I cannot choose one side or the other,’” he said. “This cannot happen when it’s about cases where international law was violated.”</p><p>Nataliia Novosolova<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Marc Santora has been reporting from Ukraine since the beginning of the war with Russia. He was previously based in London as an international news editor focused on breaking news events and earlier the bureau chief for East and Central Europe, based in Warsaw.
