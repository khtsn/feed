And the winner will very likely be decided in one of the seven battleground states where neither candidate holds a clear edge. But instead of making another appearance in Wisconsin or Pennsylvania, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/us/politics/harris-beyonce-houston-texas.html" title="">Kamala Harris is spending the evening in Texas</a>.</p><p>The Harris campaign does not think she stands a chance of winning the state. Instead, Harris is hoping that her event, where she will be joined by Beyoncé and Willie Nelson, will transcend traditional politics. Her aides expect moments of the rally, which is focused on abortion rights, to deliver the sort of viral content that can cut through a cluttered media environment.</p><p>It’s a distinctly modern strategy that acknowledges that many voters experience politics mostly online. It’s also a way for the candidates to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/arts/television/donald-trump-kamala-harris.html" title="">remain in the public eye</a> despite the absence of another presidential debate.</p><p>Donald Trump is doing something similar. He also visited Texas today to appear on Joe Rogan’s incredibly popular podcast. And he is holding a rally on Sunday at Madison Square Garden in New York, a state his campaign acknowledges will vote for Harris.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Destroyed buildings following Israeli airstrikes in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haitham Imad/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-1c443ca2">Israel pounded Gaza and Lebanon with airstrikes</h2><p>Israeli strikes today in Gaza left dozens dead and cut off communications between the outside world and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-gaza-lebanon.html" title="">one of the last functioning hospitals in the enclave’s north</a>, according to local authorities and the World Health Organization.</p><p>Israel also launched a barrage of airstrikes across a broad area of Lebanon, from the Syrian border to Beirut.
