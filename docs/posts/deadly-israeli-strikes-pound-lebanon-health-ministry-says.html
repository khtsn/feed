The strike on the coastal city of Sidon, which was not included in that tally, injured three people in addition to the three it killed, Lebanon’s health ministry said. </p><p>The night before, the ministry said, at least 40 people were killed in Baalbek, which is famous for its towering Roman ruins, and the broader Bekaa Valley that surrounds it. Attacks in other parts of the country killed another 36 people on Wednesday, the ministry added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Baalbek was home to around 80,000 people before Israel’s military launched its assault and ground invasion aimed at crippling Hezbollah. While the city was largely spared during the early weeks of the campaign, Israeli <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/world/middleeast/israel-evacuation-baalbek.html" title="">military warnings</a> in late October prompted much of its population to flee.</p><p>Since then, Israel’s military has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/world/middleeast/israel-evacuation-baalbek.html" title="">repeatedly struck</a> Baalbek. On Thursday morning, Israel’s military said it had struck around 20 targets tied to Hezbollah around the city and north of the Litani river in southern Lebanon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07mideast-leadall-swap-mbjc/07mideast-leadall-swap-mbjc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07mideast-leadall-swap-mbjc/07mideast-leadall-swap-mbjc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07mideast-leadall-swap-mbjc/07mideast-leadall-swap-mbjc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Damaged cars and debris near an ancient Roman temple.

Lebanon’s transport minister, Ali Hamieh, said on Thursday that the airport was operating normally.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>More than 3,000 people have been killed in Lebanon since October of last year — most in the months since Israel ramped up its campaign against Hezbollah. More than 1.2 million people — a fifth of the country’s population — have fled their homes, according to the Lebanese government.</p><p>Here’s what else is happening in the Middle East:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Polio vaccinations:</strong> The United Nations said it completed the second round of its polio vaccination campaign in Gaza on Wednesday. The second dose of the vaccine was given to more than 556,774 children under the age of ten, which amounted to about 94 percent of the campaign’s goal, according to the United Nations. It called the vaccination rate “a remarkable achievement given the extremely difficult circumstances” created by the war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Medical evacuations:</strong> The World Health Organization said on Thursday that it had carried out the largest medical evacuation since the start of war in the Gaza Strip, with 229 patients and their escorts traveling from the enclave to Romania and the United Arab Emirates. The patients, who left Gaza on Wednesday, included 38 children and 52 adults, including 37 people with cancer. </p></li><li><p><strong>Israeli deportations:</strong> Israel’s Parliament passed a law on Wednesday allowing the deportation of parents, children, and spouses of convicted terrorists if they are believed to have known about an attack in advance without informing the authorities. The law authorizes the Interior Minister to deport those relatives to Gaza or another “specified destination.” Widely seen as targeting Israel’s Palestinian minority, the law was condemned as discriminatory by Rawhi Fattouh, a Palestinian leader in the West Bank.</p></li></ul></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liam Stack is a Times reporter on special assignment in Israel, covering the war in Gaza.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack">More about Liam Stack</a></span></p></div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matthew-mpoke-bigg">More about Matthew Mpoke Bigg</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
