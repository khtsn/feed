But from that confluence of two great rivers, the Sacramento and the San Joaquin, 1,100 miles of webbed waterways and levees send upward of six million acre-feet of freshwater a year to thirstier parts of the state, from farms in the San Joaquin Valley to the Southern California megalopolis. Known as the California Delta, the estuary is among the state’s most important sources of water — and most consistent flash points over environmental protection.</p><p>Donald Trump first saw the political utility of the estuary in 2016 on the campaign trail, when he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPe-WY2eghY&amp;t=4203s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denied</a> the existence of a drought in California, claiming that the state had wasted its precious freshwater by sending it into the ocean. He was referring to a fight over diverting water from the Delta to protect a native fish species called the delta smelt, and he was implicitly siding with farmers who argued they were more deserving of the water than the federally threatened species. He revisited this battle in his first term as president, but environmentalists stopped him in the courts from redirecting more water to farmers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-1"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/07/opinion/07Jones/07Jones-square640-v2.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/07/opinion/07Jones/07Jones-square640-v2.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/03/04/135110_1_07jones-0925_wg_mobile_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Irrigation pipes pull water from a Delta waterway and into an irrigation ditch.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>This January, he waded back into the issue, accusing California Democrats of prioritizing the delta smelt over helping Los Angeles fight out-of-control wildfires, even though water from the estuary would most likely not have made a difference for firefighters. He used the fires to implicitly challenge legal protections of endangered species and in a memo gave the secretaries of commerce and the interior 90 days to find ways to divert more Delta water for cities and farms that he claimed “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/putting-people-over-fish-stopping-radical-environmentalism-to-provide-water-to-southern-california/?mc_cid=9ae502bf8e&amp;mc_eid=7d4bff24a2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">desperately</a> need” it.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>For Mr. Trump and some conservatives, the California Delta is a potent symbol of environmentalism’s overreach and the incompatibility of farming and conservation. And <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/climate/trump-california-water-dams-reservoirs/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by meddling in California’s water debates</a>, he stokes a host of tensions: between state and federal water management, urban Los Angeles and the rural Delta, and agricultural and residential uses.</p><p>But the so-called war over California’s water is a dangerous, flawed trope that reduces certain water uses to right or wrong, and turns the Delta into a place with no local stakes. Faced with threats of drought, climate change and water scarcity, we should not reduce this place to a warring of two — or even many — sides.</p><p><strong>I was born and raised in Fresno,</strong> two hours south of the California Delta but close enough to feel its iconic breeze.

At a marina in the city of Isleton, I watched herons and egrets nest atop eucalyptus trees along the riverbank. I saw cargo vessels chug through the Delta’s deep water channel while fishermen cast lines from its shoreline. In this ecosystem of tidal marshes, wildlife and lush vegetation, water is a livelihood, not just a resource.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>But I also saw signs of decline: long-abandoned boats and deserted marinas suggested something significant had been lost.

This supposed rivalry was set in motion long before Mr. Trump got into politics, but his administration’s hostility toward environmentalists will only intensify the pressures on an already fragile ecosystem. In the long-running conflict over water in the arid West, the “water wars” narrative ensures that no side really ever wins — only that some lose more than others.</p><p>Call it a bellwether, an indicator or a harbinger, what happens to the Delta is always a warning.
