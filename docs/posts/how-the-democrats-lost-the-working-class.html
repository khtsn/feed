Society was separating into two tiers, Mr. Reich said, with “a few winners and a larger group of Americans left behind, whose anger and whose disillusionment is easily manipulated.”</p><p>“Today, the targets of that rage are immigrants and welfare mothers and government officials and gays and an ill-defined counterculture,” Mr. Reich cautioned. “But as the middle class continues to erode, who will be the targets tomorrow?”</p><p>His message went largely unheeded for 30 years, as one president after another, Republican and Democratic, led administrations into a post-Cold War global future that enriched the nation as a whole and some on the coasts to staggering levels, but left many pockets of the American heartland deindustrialized, dislocated and even depopulated.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As a half-century-old world order organized around American-Soviet contention gave way to a more freely competitive landscape of shifting alliances, presidents from both parties sought to secure U.S. leadership under new rules for economic competition, global stability and strong financial markets. Democratic presidents tried, with limited success, to expand safety nets at home, especially health care and income support for the poor. In the end, however, their bets on foreign policy — opening China to capitalism, halting Iran’s nuclear program, tightening economic bonds with allies — took precedence, and a new fealty to megadonors shaped fiscal policies that bolstered financial markets but shuttered many factories.</p><p>The unintended consequences often came at the expense of American workers. And Mr. Reich’s “anxious class” — neither the impoverished nor the highfliers riding the rising global stock market — felt unheard until the rise of an unlikely new kind of Republican: Donald J.

Jason Furman, an economic adviser in the Clinton and Obama White Houses, said the biggest expansions of income inequality came in the 1980s and 1990s, before the China shock. Overall, China’s integration into world markets did increase the number of jobs in the United States — selling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/31/business/with-trade-links-stronger-us-insurers-scout-for-business-in-china.html" title="">services like insurance</a> and Hollywood movies to the Chinese, and peddling Chinese-made goods at stores like Walmart — while sharply lowering the cost of living for American consumers.</p><p>What was less appreciated beforehand was the psychological damage that would be done by factory closures, large and small, in communities where prestige, stability and identity centered on those plants — as well as the political impacts of those closures on key industrial states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin.</p><p>Democratic policies focused on people as consumers instead of as workers, counting on those people whose jobs were eliminated to find their way to jobs newly created — an assumption that was often flawed, given that the new service jobs frequently required out-of-reach skills or were located on the coasts, not in the upper Midwest.</p><p>Too often, said Jared Bernstein, the chairman of President Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers, there was a “disregard for the importance of work, the dignity of work.”</p><p>“Forty people might have lost their job in a factory, but 100,000 people in the community had lower prices,” Mr. Bernstein said. “The calculus seemed obvious.

Across the developed world, as Western democracies have grown more affluent and less industrially centered, so have the parties that once represented the working classes, said Thomas Piketty, the French economist who has become one of the foremost experts on wealth inequality.</p><p>It seemed to make sense politically: With the largest cities and the growing suburbs backing those center-left parties — which Mr. Piketty called “the Brahmin left,” or “parties of the educated” — shrinking towns and rural areas would matter less and less.</p><p>But there was always a problem with the theory, said Mr. Bernstein, the Biden adviser: “About 60 percent of the work force is still not college-educated.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a veteran Republican economic adviser in the Bush White House and for John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign, observed that huge shocks to the nation’s economic system — terrorism and war, the financial crisis and the coronavirus pandemic — had upended many Americans’ lives, but least of all those of the wealthy. The rich did not send their children to war, their banks were bailed out, and they rode out the pandemic working from home.</p><p>“In all of it, the elites got away unscathed,” Mr. Holtz-Eakin said, “while the ordinary man took it on the chin.”</p><p>Exploiting such resentments, Mr. Trump, with his relentless economic appeals and his open disregard for America’s global leadership, broke the Democratic formula by winning over not only a large majority of the white working class but also a strong percentage of workers of color.</p><p>Of course, there is plenty of blame to go around.</p><p>Labor leaders often point to the Democratic Party’s movement away from unions as an intermediary between the party and working-class voters.

Katz, a Harvard professor who was the chief economist in the Clinton Labor Department, said unions had played their own negative role. As the chief negotiator on the labor agreements that would accompany NAFTA’s passage, Mr. Katz recalled, he worked out an $8 billion package to bolster unemployment insurance, expand job training and relocation assistance and increase other transition programs for every worker affected by trade, whether in a union or not.</p><p>Union leaders balked, he said. They simply wanted to kill NAFTA. Short of that, they wanted any trade adjustment assistance to go through the unions to union workers.

Factory construction has doubled relative to the Trump administration — doubled.”</p><p>A “worker-centered trade policy” strengthened so-called Buy America commitments, maintained most of Mr. Trump’s tariffs on foreign products and pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into new American infrastructure and factories.</p><p>“Our new approach to trade recognizes people as more than just consumers, but also producers,” Ms. Tai said in a 2023 speech, “the workers, wage-earners, providers, and community members that comprise a vibrant middle class.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-43"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Biden’s administration could be seen as a corrective to decades of working-class neglect, even if those voters proved to be in an unforgiving mood in November.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">T.J.

Ms. Harris saw some electoral gains among union workers. But she lost far more ground in the much larger, nonunion work force.</p><p>In November, 56 percent of voters without college degrees voted for Mr. Trump. In 1992, just 36 percent of voters with only a high school diploma voted Republican — about the same percentage that Barry Goldwater got in his overwhelming defeat against Lyndon Johnson in 1964.</p><p>Republican and Democratic economists point to a single reason: inflation. Mr. Reich’s “anxious class” was as anxious as ever, unwilling to see policy shifts that might take years to bear fruit as a salve for the immediate pain of rising prices.</p><p>Democrats said the president was the political victim of a global trend emerging from the pandemic. Republicans pointed to his policies, and one piece of legislation in particular, the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, saying it poured gasoline on the smoldering embers of post-pandemic inflation.</p><p>“The American Rescue Plan killed the Biden administration in its infancy,” Mr. Holtz-Eakin said, almost ruefully. “It was the worst thing they could have done, and they did it. They were warned, and they did it anyway.”</p><p>Ana Swanson<!-- --> contributed reporting from Washington.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jonathan Weisman is a politics writer, covering campaigns with an emphasis on economic and labor policy.
