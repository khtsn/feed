Both people discussed the meetings on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the sensitive diplomacy.</p><p>Karoline Leavitt, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, did not deny that direct talks with Hamas were underway. Asked at a White House news conference on Wednesday why the administration was engaging with Hamas, she said Mr. Boehler, “who is engaged in those negotiations,” had “the authority to talk to anyone.”</p><p>The scope of the discussions was not immediately clear, but mediators have been seeking to extend the current truce between Israel and Hamas and free the remaining hostages in Gaza. About 24 living captives — including Edan Alexander, an American citizen — and the bodies of at least 35 others are believed to still be held in Gaza, according to Israel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The secret talks, which <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/05/us-hamas-talks-gaza-war-israel" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Axios</a> first confirmed, marked a significant departure from previous negotiations involving the United States and Hamas, which the U.S. government has for decades considered a terrorist group. American officials, like their Israeli counterparts, have generally relied on intermediaries — most recently, Qatar and Egypt have been the main go-betweens — to relay messages to the group rather than sit down with Hamas leaders.</p><p>“Israel was consulted on this matter,” said Ms. Levitt, referring further questions to the State Department. “There are American lives at stake,” she added.</p><p>In a tersely worded statement, the Israeli prime minister’s office said Israel had “stated its opinion on direct conversations with Hamas during talks with the United States.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Adam Boehler, President Trump’s nominee to be special envoy on hostage matters, in 2020.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Armend Nimani/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Hamas did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>U.S. and European officials had hoped the no-contact policy with Hamas would isolate and weaken the group after it seized control of the Gaza Strip in 2007. Critics occasionally questioned the <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2021/05/can-there-be-freedom-prosperity-and-democracy-for-gaza?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">effectiveness</a> of the boycott, which continued through years of deadlock and little apparent shift in Hamas’s positions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, ignited the war in Gaza, mediators played major roles in brokering efforts to pause or end the fighting and to free Israeli and other hostages seized by Palestinian militants in exchange for the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.</p><p>Hamas and its allies seized about 250 captives during the attack on southern Israel, according to the Israeli government. More than 100 were freed during a weeklong truce in late 2023, while another 30 — and the bodies of eight more — have been released since the current cease-fire began in mid-January.</p><p>Israel and Hamas are currently deadlocked over terms for the current deal’s next phase: a comprehensive truce that would end the war and free the remaining living hostages still held in Gaza. The direct U.S. contact with Hamas sidestepped those stalled talks.</p><p>President Trump nominated Mr. Boehler to serve as a special envoy on hostage affairs in early December. A health care executive who held roles in Mr. Trump’s first administration, Mr. Boehler has yet to be confirmed to the job by the U.S. Senate.</p><p>President Trump said during an address to Congress on Tuesday evening that his administration was “bringing back our hostages from Gaza,” without providing any additional details at the time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Since the war began, the United States has sought to help broker agreements between Israel and Hamas to end the devastating war in Gaza and free the hostages. U.S. officials have been particularly concerned over the fates of at least 12 American-Israeli captives taken by Hamas during the deadly attack, staying in touch with their families and inviting them to the White House for meetings.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yael Alexander, in a gray scarf, the mother of the only living American hostage remaining in Gaza, Edan Alexander, at a rally for families of hostages in Tel Aviv, Israel, last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maya Alleruzzo/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Hamas now holds one living American-Israeli captive — Mr. Alexander, a 21-year-old Israeli soldier from New Jersey — and the bodies of four others seized during the 2023 attacks. But with the next steps in the Israel-Hamas cease-fire still in doubt, it is unclear whether the two sides can clinch a deal to secure their release.</p><p>Mr. Alexander grew up in Tenafly, N.J., to Israeli-American parents. He later moved back to Israel to serve in the military, before being abducted from an outpost near the Gaza border during the Hamas-led assault.</p><p>Adi Alexander, Mr. Alexander’s father, said during an interview last week that the Trump administration had to “reshuffle the deck, to renegotiate everything” in an attempt to extend the truce and free the remaining hostages, including his son.</p><p>“We are happy and grateful about the cease-fire — but the job is not done,” Adi Alexander said.</p><p>Ed Wong<!-- -->, <!-- -->Luke Broadwater<!-- --> and <!-- -->David E.
