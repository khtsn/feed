The city, about 300 miles south of Cairo, was a burial place for early pharaohs and became a pilgrimage site in antiquity. A necropolis developed at Anubis Mountain to the city’s south.</p><p>Researchers uncovered the tomb at the mountain, at the base of a high desert cliff where strong winds carry gusts of sand. In some places around the necropolis, sand has buried structures more than 16 or 19 feet deep.</p><p>The burial chamber features a decorated entryway, several rooms and soaring 16-foot vaults made of mud bricks. It dwarfs a tomb unearthed at Abydos over a decade ago, which was <a href="https://www.penn.museum/about/press-room/press-releases/pharaoh-senebkay-discovery-josef-wegner#:~:text=PHILADELPHIA%2C%20PA%2C%20January%202014%E2%80%94,1650%E2%80%931600%20BC." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hailed</a> at the time as the first material proof of a “lost” dynasty of kings there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“It’s a new chapter in investigating this dynasty,” Josef W. Wegner, a curator at the Penn Museum in Philadelphia and the leader of the American side of the excavation, said in an interview on Wednesday. “It’s pretty exciting.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The king once buried in this tomb was thought to have ruled parts of Egypt some 3,600 years ago.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dr. Josef Wegner for the Penn Museum</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Egypt’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities briefly <a href="https://egymonuments.gov.eg/en/news/unveiling-of-a-second-intermediate-period-royal-tomb-in-abydos" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described</a> the findings at Abydos earlier this month, but researchers at the Penn Museum announced more about their discovery on Thursday.</p><p>Similarities between the newly unearthed tomb and the one discovered in 2014, which belonged to a king named Seneb-Kay, have led the archaeologists to conclude that the as-yet-unknown pharaoh may have been an earlier member of the so-called Abydos dynasty.</p><p>In the newly discovered tomb, painted scenes on plastered brickwork decorated the entrance to the limestone burial chamber, showing the goddess Isis and her sister Nephthys, who were often paired in funerary rites.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“This tomb and Seneb-Kay’s tomb are the earliest surviving royal tombs that actually have painted decorations inside of them,” Mr. Wegner said.</p><p>But there were no identifiable skeletal remains at the newly unearthed site and, like a tomb found <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/world/middleeast/egypt-tomb-archaeologists.html" title="">near the Valley of the Kings</a> earlier this year, the one at Abydos has suffered major damage over the centuries.</p><p>At Abydos, grave robbers picked the tomb largely clean. A grand recess in the burial chamber for canopic jars — vessels for organs, typically held in a gilded box — stood empty. Archaeologists have found pottery and inscriptions around Abydos showing that, during the late Roman period around 1700 years ago, people were digging into tombs to extract the limestone, granite and quartzite within.</p><p>And although the name of the ruler in the newly excavated tomb had once been visible in yellow bands of hieroglyphic texts, the actions of ancient grave robbers had rendered it illegible.</p><p>“They did just enough damage to the decoration that we have just the very base of what would have been the identifying text columns,” Mr. Wegner said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The frustrated team of researchers expressed “some cuss words,” Mr. Wegner added. “But the archaeological record doesn’t always yield exactly what you hope for, so you keep going.” </p><p>Anna-Latifa Mourad-Cizek, a professor of archaeology at the University of Chicago who was not involved in the research, called the new excavation “highly significant” and said it would add to what little is known about “a fascinating period when Egypt was controlled by competing powers.”</p><p>The era was “politically enigmatic,” she said, defined by economic instability and warring kingdoms.</p><p>It appeared to be “a phase of warrior pharaohs fighting it out,” Mr. Wegner said, noting that Seneb-Kay’s skeleton suggested he may have died in combat. The period also laid “the groundwork for the great empire of the New Kingdom,” when Egypt was reunited by the rulers of Thebes, he added.</p><p>The newly found tomb, Mr. Wegner said, could offer insight into how the Nile Valley, in the time before the New Kingdom, had gradually fragmented among rival rulers. The findings suggested, he said, that the Abydos dynasty was not “a kind of flash in the pan where you’ve got a handful of kings breaking off from whatever original territory they belonged to.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>While the extent of the land controlled by those buried here is not known, “the Abydos dynasty kings only appeared to rule a region around the city, rather than all of Egypt,” said Matthew Adams, an archaeologist who works on an unrelated project in the area. “But their use of the title of ‘king’ suggests they had aspirations to something greater.”</p><p>Mr. Wegner said there are several candidates for who had been interred in this tomb, including two kings named Senaiib and Paentjeni who dedicated monuments at Abydos but whose tombs remain unknown. He added that the team would work to manage and protect the site, and that it had plans to keep excavating in search of other sites and tombs.</p><p>“It’s always our dream to find one that’s intact or partially intact,” he said. “There may yet be tombs like that.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
