Its history is intertwined with the country’s economic and industrial prowess of the post-World War II era, and local economies of entire regions across the country depend on Volkswagen and its well-paid workers.</p><p>Volkswagen declined to comment on the details of the plan, saying it would do so only once the company and employee representatives had agreed to a solution. But in a statement, managers said that because of shrinking demand and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/business/europe-china-electric-vehicles-tariffs.html" title="">growing competition</a>, employment costs in Germany remained too high and existing structures would have to change.</p><p>“Without comprehensive measures to regain competitiveness, we will not be able to afford significant investments in the future,” Gunnar Kilian, a member of the management board, said in the statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The company’s plans include “heavy pay cuts for the remaining employees,” said Daniela Cavallo, who leads the council representing Volkswagen’s workers in Germany.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Julian Stratenschult</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>A spokesman for Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, suggested that “wrong management decisions” could be to blame for Volkswagen’s troubles, and said workers should not have to pay the price.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The aim now is to maintain and secure jobs,” the spokesman, Wolfgang Büchner, told a regular briefing by government officials.</p><p>Mr. Scholz is under pressure to revive the flagging German economy, the largest in Europe, amid shrinking industrial output. The country is the only one of the world’s seven leading economies that the International Monetary Fund is projecting will stagnate this year. The German government said this month that it expected the economy to contract 0.2 percent in 2024, down from an earlier projection of 0.3 percent growth.</p><p>Volkswagen suggested last month that factory closures in Germany might be necessary for its flagship brand to remain relevant. Automobile manufacturing is Germany’s most important industry, contributing 564 billion euros, or $610 billion, to the country’s economy.</p><p>But it is also heavily dependent on exports, especially to China, where German manufacturers sold around 4.3 million cars in 2021, according to the German Association of the Automotive Industry, a trade group. In recent years, however, Chinese consumers have turned to domestically produced electric vehicles, causing demand for German vehicles to fall.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Since the pandemic, the demand for cars in Europe has also dropped by roughly 500,000, as Volkswagen leaders have repeatedly pointed out. From the management’s perspective, that number translates roughly to the output of two of Volkswagen’s 10 plants in Germany, said Arno Antlitz, Volkswagen’s chief financial officer.</p><p>“This is basically the magnitude of two factories,” he said. “This is where we stand, and we have to look at it.”</p><p>Volkswagen is also in wage negotiations with the IG Metall union, which represents most of the carmaker’s workers and is seeking a 7 percent pay increase. The two sides decided to open the talks over a new pay deal several months early because of the restructuring plans.</p><p>The next round is scheduled for Wednesday, and Ms. Cavallo called on the company to present employees with a plan. Her announcement two days before the talks added to the uncertainty among workers.</p><p>“My colleagues and I, we are worried about our jobs,” Britta John, a Volkswagen employee and spokeswoman for IG Metall in Braunschweig, told the German public broadcaster NDR. “The situation is really discouraging.”</p><p>Jack Ewing<!-- --> contributed reporting from New York.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Melissa Eddy is based in Berlin and reports on Germany’s politics, businesses and its economy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/melissa-eddy">More about Melissa Eddy</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Creating Pharmacy Deserts</strong>: Obscure but powerful health care middlemen — companies known as pharmacy benefit managers, or P.B.M.s — are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/business/drugstores-closing-pbm-pharmacy.html">driving local drugstores out of business</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/business/drugstores-closing-pbm-pharmacy.html">.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>A Retail Monstrosity</strong>: Americans once made their own costumes and candy for Halloween.
