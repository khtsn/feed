No one had been arrested in the case as of Saturday afternoon. </p><p>The attack is likely to heighten fears of growing antisemitism in France, which has the largest Jewish population in Western Europe. Attacks against Jewish people in France have increased in recent years, and the government said it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/world/europe/french-election-antisemitism-jews.html" title="">recorded more than 360</a> antisemitic episodes in the first three months of 2024. The Israel-Hamas war has further heightened tensions in a society <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/07/world/europe/france-election-new-popular-front-far-right.html" title="">increasingly divided</a> by religion and ideology.</p><p> President Emmanuel Macron vowed that the perpetrators would be tracked down, and that Jewish places of worship in France would be protected.</p><p>“The fight against antisemitism is a constant battle,” Mr. Macron said, adding that it was a fight for “a united nation.”</p><p>Officials in the municipality of Hérault, which includes La Grande Motte, said the city would be vigilant in protecting buildings associated with its Jewish community. </p></div></div><div><div><p>The municipality also canceled a demonstration planned for Saturday in nearby Montpellier by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/world/middleeast/bds-israel-boycott-antisemitic.html" title="">seeks to</a> mobilize economic and political pressure on Israel over its treatment of Palestinians. </p><p>During France’s recent elections, the country’s left, particularly Jean-Luc Melénchon, the founder of France Unbowed, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/world/europe/french-election-antisemitism-jews.html" title="">accused of fanning antisemitism</a>. </p><p>After Saturday’s explosions, Mr. Melénchon <a href="https://x.com/JLMelenchon/status/1827272895824826584" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described the attack</a> as an “intolerable crime” and called on France to uphold principles of secularism. </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lynsey Chutel covers South Africa and the countries that make up southern Africa from Johannesburg.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lynsey-chutel">More about Lynsey Chutel</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
