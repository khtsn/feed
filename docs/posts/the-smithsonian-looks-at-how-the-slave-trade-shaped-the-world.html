But they are also a metaphor for the difficulties of truly grasping the subject of slavery, Johanna Obenda, one of the show’s curators, explained recently during a tour of the exhibition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“With this history, oftentimes we get lost in the enormity,” she said. “It’s challenging to even process.

The product of a 10-year collaboration among nearly two dozen curators at 10 institutions on four continents, it goes beyond the Smithsonian’s traditional American focus to tell a global story of the ways that slavery shaped the modern world.</p><p>It’s a story of trade, capitalism, exploitation and violence, but also of the ways that the enslaved and their descendants constantly pushed back, creating their own freedom in ways big and small.</p><p>“If we’re talking about violence and attempted dehumanization, we’re also talking about the way people resisted and held on to their humanity,” Paul Gardullo, the museum’s assistant director of history and one of the exhibition’s directors, said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>After closing in Washington next June, the show will travel to partner museums in Brazil, South Africa, Senegal, Belgium and Britain, switching languages — and swapping out some objects — along the way.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A display including signs from Black Lives Matter protests around the world.

As Lonnie G. Bunch III, the Smithsonian’s secretary, puts it in an introduction to the show’s companion book, “A strong current of political leaders wants to prevent the public from engaging with Black history, which they deem ‘too divisive,’ and create a culture of silence.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>One case juxtaposes shackles used on enslaved people, produced by the British company Hiatt &amp; Co, with modern handcuffs produced by Hiatt today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Anthony Bogues, a professor of Africana studies at Brown University and another project director, said in a telephone interview that the group had thought hard about how to draw connections between history and the present without sparking defensiveness.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“We are careful about making sure we are not banging people on the head, but telling stories in a certain kind of sophisticated but simple way so they say, ‘Oh, I see,’” Bogues said.</p><p>Wrestling unflinchingly with slavery and its legacy, Gardullo said, is the museum’s core mission. Done well, he said, “it’s about Black love and Black freedom, not about white guilt.”</p><p>The seeds of the exhibition were planted in 2014, when a group of international curators met at Brown’s Ruth J. Simmons Center for the Study of Race and Justice, which Bogues leads. The center had done a study of about 90 exhibitions about slavery presented around the world over the previous decade. Most, it found, told a national or regional story, which neglected one of the central realities that scholars increasingly emphasize: its transnational nature.</p><p>Over the following years, the group brainstormed ways to create an exhibit that wouldn’t just tell a global story, but do it through a genuine global partnership.</p><p>As the meetings moved to Amsterdam, Cape Town, Rio de Janeiro and other cities, the curators settled on several basic principles. The exhibition couldn’t just tell a linear story that ended neatly with emancipation. African partners in particular (the show will also travel to the Iziko Museums of South Africa in Cape Town and the Museum of Black Civilizations in Dakar) emphasized the need to connect the slave trade with European colonial domination of Africa, which intensified after slavery was fully abolished in the Americas in the late 19th century.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The entry to “In Slavery’s Wake,” with a video by Tiffany McNeil. “Rather than starting from a historical launching point, we wanted to meet people where they are and create a mood,” Johanna Obenda, one of the curators, said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The exhibition also needed to foreground the voices of the enslaved and colonized and their descendants. To that end, the curators started an oral history project, Unfinished Conversations, which has so far gathered more than 150 interviews around the world, some of which are woven into the exhibit.</p><p>Still, when it came to creating an actual exhibition, the curators faced some basic questions: What to call it? And where to begin?</p><p>The title draws on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/26/magazine/christina-sharpe-black-literature.html" title="">scholar Christina Sharpe</a>’s metaphor of “the wake”: a reference to the wake behind a ship, the still-churning waters of history, the watching over of the dead, and the coming to consciousness. An opening video installation, by the filmmaker Tiffany McNeil, introduces the idea with a collage of contemporary scenes, archival footage and watery imagery.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A peek-through wall in the installation by Daniel Minter incorporates musical instruments and other artifacts enslaved people used as “tools of freedom.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>“Rather than starting from a historical launching point, we wanted to meet people where they are and create a mood,” Obenda said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>A historical section presents plenty of cold, hard facts, starting with a wall map <a href="https://www.slavevoyages.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">showing the flow</a> of the roughly 12 million Africans carried away into chattel slavery (which was distinct from the forms of bondage that had long existed in many societies, including in Africa). Of those people, about 500,000 came to what is now the United States — a figure dwarfed by the estimated five million who landed in Brazil.</p><p>Another graphic illustrates the web of institutions — banks, insurance companies, universities — that benefited from slavery, and the ways that law, religion and science were used to create and enforce the idea of Black inferiority.</p><p>Nearby is a hulking 19th-century commodity scale from Bahia, Brazil, that was used to weigh crops grown by enslaved people (and possibly, a label suggests, the enslaved themselves).</p><p>It feels eerie, even threatening. But near the top, Obenda pointed out the elaborate decorative ironwork across the balance.</p><p>“There were so many skilled African artisans and ironworkers in Brazil,” she said. “It makes me wonder, ‘Who made this? Whose hands touched it?’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A portrait of Marème Diarra, an enslaved woman who in the 1890s walked hundreds of miles from Mali to a “freedom village” in Senegal, where slavery had been abolished.
