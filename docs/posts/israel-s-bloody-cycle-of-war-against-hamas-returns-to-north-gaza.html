In an effort to stamp out what the military has called a Hamas resurgence, troops, tanks and armed drones have hammered the area almost daily, displacing 100,000 residents and killing likely more than 1,000 others, according to the United Nations. (Those statistics do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.)</p><p>There are so many corpses, multiple residents and a local doctor said, that stray dogs have begun to pick at them in the streets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Life over the past four weeks, if I can sum it up, is a people being exterminated,” said Islam Ahmad, 34, a freelance journalist from North Gaza who described helping bury neighbors in a mass grave.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians at the site of an Israeli strike on a house in North Gaza on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hassan Al-Zaanin/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The return of fighting to the northernmost reaches of the Gaza Strip shows how Israel’s approach has led to a bloody carousel of sorts, with the Israeli military chasing Hamas fighters in circles — and civilians often caught in the crossfire.</p><p>Two Israeli security officials compared it to cutting the grass, using a phrase that has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000002989054/cutting-the-grass-of-hamass-militancy.html" title="">circulated among Israeli officials</a> for years, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/23/world/israel-gaza-war-hamas" title="">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a>. Each time Hamas cells regrow, they say, Israeli forces will come back to cut them down.</p><p>This sort of cyclical combat reflects Israel’s murky strategy in a war now in its 14th month. Israel has eliminated much of Hamas’s senior military leadership, killed thousands of its fighters and collapsed many of its tunnels — yet Israel has shown no sign of letting up.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That is in part because Israeli forces have avoided holding much ground and Mr. Netanyahu has not committed to a viable postwar plan. Hamas has filled the resulting power vacuum.</p><p>North Gaza is the northernmost of Gaza’s five governorates, just north of Gaza City. Israeli forces left after pummeling the region last year. In May, they returned for an <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-completes-three-week-op-in-north-gazas-jabaliya-described-as-wars-most-intense-fighting/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">intense bout of fighting</a> and recovered the bodies of seven hostages seized in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel last year. Then they left again. Hamas fighters regrouped, and now, once more, the military is back.</p><p>The goal this time is to isolate Hamas fighters in North Gaza from others in Gaza City, according to a senior Israeli security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe military tactics. Israel captured 500 suspected Hamas fighters and killed another 750 in North Gaza last month, the official said. He said the military had encouraged civilians to evacuate but did not track civilian casualties. He said forces planned to remain for at least another month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians reciting a prayer over people killed in Israeli strikes in North Gaza on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Omar Al-Qattaa/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Gadi Shamni, a retired general who once commanded Israeli forces in Gaza, said full occupation would demand tremendous resources, but the current approach is a temporary fix, with ugly consequences for residents.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“As soon as you evacuate those alleys and streets, Hamas will regain control immediately,” he said. “The main problem here is that the government of Israel, and Netanyahu himself, is trying to bypass the real solution of finding an alternative to Hamas” to govern Gaza.</p><p>The situation on the ground, by some measures, is even more dire than a year ago. Infrastructure is crumbling, humanitarian aid is severely restricted, and many emergency workers and aid groups have left. On Friday, a U.N.-backed panel said that famine was likely “<a href="https://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_FRC_Alert_Gaza_Nov2024.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imminent</a>” within northern Gaza.</p><p>The Palestinian Civil Defense, the emergency service run by Hamas’s interior ministry, said it had officially halted rescue operations in the region last month because of the intense threat.</p><p>The Palestinian Red Crescent, one of the few aid groups still operating there, said that no ambulances could reach the hardest-hit parts of North Gaza. When a woman recently called for rescue after a relative lost a limb, the dispatcher provided instructions over the phone on how to treat the amputation, the spokeswoman said.</p><p>Hosam Al Sharif, 46, a father of four in Jabaliya, said that at the start of the latest siege, help was available. Now, he said, people with “any minor injury will bleed until they die.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Hospitals are also teetering, leaving many treatable patients to die.

There were also, according to local officials and residents, dozens of families sleeping inside. The Gaza Health Ministry said that 93 people were killed, including many children. The Israeli military disputed that number.</p><p>Mr. Ahmad, who took photos of the aftermath for Agence France-Presse, said he had also counted 93 bodies as they were carried on donkey carts to a mass grave.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“We stacked every three bodies on top of one another,” he said. “We don’t have the luxury of honoring the dead.” They lacked enough sand, he said, so they laid tiles on the grave to keep the dogs out.</p><p>Fewer than 95,000 people remain in the region, a fifth of its prewar population, according to the United Nations. Israeli officials said there are far fewer. The relentless bombing has fueled fears among Palestinians that Israel is intent on depopulating northern Gaza permanently.</p><p>Since the start of the war, Israel has urged Gazans to migrate south for their safety — even though it has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/100000009208814/israel-gaza-bomb-civilians.html" title="">repeatedly bombarded the south</a>.
