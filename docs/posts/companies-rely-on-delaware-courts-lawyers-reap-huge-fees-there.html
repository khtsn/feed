To kick off the week, I’ve been digging into a new study quietly making its rounds in corporate boardrooms. The analysis suggests Delaware’s judiciary has created a veritable fee machine for lawyers, raising pointed questions about the state’s long-held status as the preferred incorporation haven.</em></p><p><em>Meanwhile, investors are focused on new comments from the White House and China on the tariff battle. And my colleague Danielle Kaye has uncovered some truly counterintuitive implications within a provision in Republicans’ budget bill that limits states’ ability to regulate A.I. — with far-reaching consequences.</em></p><h2 id="link-6f33932f">What are Delaware judges doing?</h2><p>Delaware’s decades-long pitch to corporate America is simple: It offers predictable judges, light-touch politics and fast decisions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5237545" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new study</a> making the rounds in boardrooms — and loudly promoted by the prominent venture capitalist Bill Gurley — finds reasons for Corporate America to reconsider its reliance on courts in the First State.</p><p><strong>A fee factory?</strong> The study, by the well-known Stanford law professor Joseph Grundfest tallied every shareholder case since 2000 in which lawyers won fee “multipliers” of 7 times (“septuples”) or 10 times (“decuples”) their normal hourly rate from big corporations.</p><p>Here’s what it found:</p><ul><li><p>Delaware produced 21 septuples and 14 decuples, almost matching the entire federal system on septuples and nearly triple on decuples.</p></li><li><p>This trend has increased over the past five years: Septuple fee awards have been 23 times more common in Delaware than in federal court. Decuples were <em>57 times</em> more common.</p></li><li><p>One payout for a lawyer practicing before Delaware’s Court of Chancery worked out to an astonishing $35,000 an hour. Some lawyers are walking away with multipliers of 66 times their standard rates.</p></li><li><p>Just two chancery court judges handed out a majority of those supersize awards, so it matters which judge you get.</p></li></ul><p><strong>“Something is awry in Delaware and you should know the risks,”</strong> Gurley, the Benchmark Capital partner who invested in Uber, <a href="https://x.com/bgurley/status/1928900302859575566" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>. He has been <a href="https://x.com/bgurley/status/1910435381641875470" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">critical of Delaware</a> and supported what like-minded critics call DExit.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>A Delaware judge’s decision to void Tesla’s $56 billion pay package for Elon Musk helped prompt the billionaire to persuade shareholders to redomicile the carmaker in Texas and urge other companies to follow suit. (<a href="https://x.com/DavidSacks/status/1928907194138874301" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">He reposted</a> commentary about Gurley’s post.)</p><p>Meta is now exploring a jump from Delaware to Texas or another state. Walmart has <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/03/05/2025/maga-offers-corporations-cover-to-flee-delaware" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly told</a> Delaware lawmakers it, too, might exit.

I’m not telling anybody what it means. The data is the data.”</p><p>But if you know Grundfest — who has taught corporate directors how to be directors for 30 years and long weighed in on all sorts of governance issues — the study can be seen as a shot across the bow of Delaware’s activist approach.</p><p><strong>The study has its critics, however. </strong>It’s a small sample size to begin with, said Joel Fleming, a partner at Equity Litigation Group who represents investors. Several of the cases the authors include are not actually Delaware fee awards, he said; moreover, the methodology for federal cases is different. </p><p>(Grundfest, in response to Fleming’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/looking-lodestar-all-wrong-places-joel-fleming-ailie/?trackingId=A2jJk%2B%2FMSBCE0xawhYC1sw%3D%3D" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticism</a>, told me that “Even if we made all the adjustments that Fleming suggests — adjustments that are objectively unwarranted — Delaware would still remain an outlier on an empirical basis.”)</p><p>The authors undercounted the percentage of federal cases with big so-called lodestar attorneys’ fees, Brian Fitzpatrick, a law professor at Vanderbilt University who <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1442108" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has studied</a> class action settlements and fee awards, told DealBook.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>The question for directors:</strong> Are the long-perceived governance protections of Delaware worth the latest verdicts — and the lawyer bills — when Texas or Nevada beckon?</p><p><strong>The question for shareholders:</strong> Most companies require you to vote for them to leave Delaware.

(Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday cited Beijing’s ongoing curbs of critical mineral exports as a concern.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“The U.S. side has unilaterally escalated new economic and trade frictions, exacerbating the uncertainty and instability of bilateral economic and trade relations,” the ministry said.</p><p>That raises questions about whether the two sides can reach a deal by a 90-day deadline set last month. While Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, suggested that Trump and President Xi Jinping could hold talks as soon as this week, he acknowledged that such a discussion hadn’t been scheduled yet.</p><p><strong>“Rest assured, tariffs are not going away,”</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/01/us/trump-news#trump-tariffs-court-lutnick-bessent" title="">Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick</a> said on Sunday on “Fox News Sunday,” even as courts were weighing whether many of the levies were constitutional.</p><p>The big question: How will the Supreme Court, which recently looked askance at presidents taking sweeping economic actions <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-31/supreme-court-rulings-against-biden-now-threaten-trump-tariffs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">without congressional approval</a>, rule?</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-71efa238">What happens if states can’t regulate A.I.?</h2><p>Buried in the House budget bill is a provision about artificial intelligence that, at first, seems to mostly affect big tech companies. It bans state and local governments from regulating any algorithmic system for an entire decade.</p><p>That could remove some state-by-state confusion for companies like Microsoft, Google and OpenAI, which has urged lawmakers to oppose any laws that, as Sam Altman put it last month, would <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/05/08/sam-altman-openai-senate-hearing-testimony-china-ai-regulations/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“slow down” the U.S.</a> in its battle with China to dominate A.I. But the provision, perhaps counterintuitively, would also have a far-reaching impact on industries outside of the technology sector, Danielle Kaye reports.</p><p>Here are three big areas that could be immediately affected:</p><p><strong>Automated decision-making in health care: </strong>Big hospital systems use algorithms to decide, for example, who gets a kidney. Cigna has faced legal action over claims that it has used an algorithm to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/cigna-pxdx-medical-health-insurance-rejection-claims" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">automatically deny claims in bulk</a>.</p><p>Colorado last year <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-205" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">passed a bill</a> that is, so far, the “farthest reaching” in promoting strong governance of A.I. in health care, said Michelle Mello, a professor of law and health policy at Stanford University. Mello acknowledged that the existing patchwork of health care A.I. regulation “is not standardized and it’s not awesome.” But if the tax bill provision halts all efforts completely, “that’s not great, either,” she said.</p><p><strong>Surveillance pricing: </strong>The practice of using <a href="https://epic.org/krogers-surveillance-pricing-harms-consumers-and-raises-prices-with-or-without-facial-recognition/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vast amounts of customer data</a> to set prices, sometimes altering them for specific customers — think airlines, hotels and grocery stores — faces mounting scrutiny.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In California, State Assemblyman Chris Ward <a href="https://a78.asmdc.org/press-releases/20250206-assemblymember-ward-introduces-ab-446-prohibit-businesses-engaging" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">introduced a bill</a> this year that would prevent businesses from using customer data to make algorithmic decisions that would change prices. Ward told DealBook that he is worried the federal bill might affect his legislation: “I can’t hit the pause button, waiting to see, for a whole other year, if something does or does not apply.”</p><p><strong>Kids’ safety on social media:</strong> Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York <a href="https://apnews.com/article/social-media-teens-algorithms-d30af590aff0e255a05f9f4955bdccf0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">signed a bill</a> last year that aims to limit children’s access to algorithmic feeds on apps like TikTok and Instagram. And a new Florida law that broadly restricts teenagers’ access to social media (and has faced <a href="https://www.vox.com/life/393812/social-media-ban-australia-florida-teens-kids" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticism</a> and court challenges) indirectly regulates A.I., too, said Gaia Bernstein, a professor at Seton Hall University School of Law who studies addictive tech and social media.</p><p>She is concerned that emerging threats to children — such as A.I. bots that are “friending” kids online — would be nearly impossible to rein in if the ban becomes law. </p><p><strong>“It’s killing that innovation of legislation and regulation,” </strong>Ben Winters, director of A.I. and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America said of the potential ban on state and local A.I. laws. He added,<strong> </strong>“It takes away the states’ ability to respond to new problems as we’re seeing them come to fruition.”</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-a1a2b51">“This is America’s, and the world’s, Achilles’ heel, which China continuously exploits.” </h2><p><em>— </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/business/china-rare-earths-united-states-supplies.html" title=""><em>Nazak Nikakhtar,</em></a><em> a former Commerce Department official during the first Trump administration.

In 1998, The Times called him “the closest thing the world economy has to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/30/business/international-business-imf-s-bearer-bad-tidings-organization-s-no-2-gets-tell.html" title="">a battlefield medic</a>.” </p><p>As head of Israel’s central bank from 2005 to 2013, he steered the country through the 2008 financial crisis, moving quickly to slash interest rates and then raise them again as its economy began to recover. </p><p>“Stan, through his teaching, writing, advising and leading, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/09/07/lawrence-summers-in-praise-of-stanley-fischer/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has had as much influence on global money</a> as anyone in the last generation,” Summers wrote in 2017. “Hundreds of millions of people have lived better because of his efforts.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew Ross Sorkin is a columnist and the founder of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/dealbook">DealBook</a>, the flagship business and policy newsletter at The Times and an annual conference.</p></div><div><p>Bernhard Warner is a senior editor for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/business/dealbook">DealBook</a>, a newsletter from The Times, covering business trends, the economy and the markets.</p></div><div><p>Sarah Kessler is the weekend edition editor of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/business/dealbook">DealBook</a> newsletter and writes features on business.</p></div><div><p>Michael J. de la Merced has covered global business and finance news for The Times since 2006.</p></div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a Times business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
