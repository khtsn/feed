Trump would revoke the shelter’s lease once he takes office in January — or assert the administration’s right to launch immigration raids on federal land.</p><p>The Floyd Bennett Field shelter is among 25 shelters that will now shut down by March because of a steady decline in the number of migrants arriving over the past five months. Those include hotels across the city, two college dormitories in Upper Manhattan and a warehouse-turned-shelter at Kennedy Airport, as well as 10 hotels the city was paying to house migrants upstate.</p><p>The slate of closures was yet another signal of how the city’s migrant crisis, which prompted the city to spend more than $6 billion over two years to house migrants, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/nyregion/migrants-shelters-trump-nyc.html" title="">continued to wind down</a>. Mr. Adams, a Democrat who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/nyregion/adams-migrants-sanctuary-nyc.html" title="">has been cautious about antagonizing</a> Mr. Trump, did not name the president-elect as a reason for the closure of the Floyd Bennett Field shelter, the only one in New York City on federal land.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>City officials said that the lease would end by March, but that families would be moved out of the shelter by Jan. 15, just a few days before Mr. Trump is sworn into office.</p><p>“We’re going to continue looking for more sites to consolidate and close, and more opportunities to save taxpayer money, as we continue to successfully manage this response,” Mr. Adams said in a statement.</p><p>Some of the shelter closings had already been announced or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/nyregion/migrants-shelters-trump-nyc.html" title="">reported in the news media</a>, such as another tent complex on Randall’s Island, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/nyregion/randalls-island-nyc-migrant-shelter-closing.html" title="">will close by February</a>. Migrants living in those shelters will be transferred to others in the system, which is housing 54,900 migrants, down from a peak of 69,000 in January.</p><p>The tent complex on Floyd Bennett Field, the city’s third-largest family shelter, has housed migrant families with children since November 2023. The city entered into a lease with the Biden administration to erect the tent dormitory, where families sleep in cots, as city officials scrambled to find beds for migrants at the height of the influx last year.</p><p>But after Mr. Trump’s victory last month, City Hall officials grew concerned that the president-elect would cancel the lease the moment he took office, following opposition from local Republicans who said it amounted to wasteful spending of taxpayer money. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, had committed state money to reimburse the city for the shelter’s operations and would continue to finance an equivalent number of beds for migrants in other shelters, city officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>City officials, as well as immigration lawyers, also worried that the shelter could become an easy target for federal Immigration Customs and Enforcement agents looking to detain undocumented immigrants. Under current city guidelines, ICE officers require hard-to-obtain judicial warrants to enter city shelters, but the shelter’s location on federal land raised concerns that federal agents could easily gain access.</p><p>The tent shelter had been the subject of a bipartisan lawsuit that argued that its construction skirted laws meant to protect national parkland. Immigration activists also opposed housing migrants there, saying that the tent setup was inhumane and that its location, miles away from more populated areas of the city, made it harder for migrants to reach jobs and schools.</p><p>The Legal Aid Society and the Coalition for the Homeless, welcomed the closure, but noted in a joint statement that they were “closely monitoring these closures and transfers to ensure new arrivals’ access to shelter and protection from any potential federal immigration enforcement dragnets.”</p><p>Representative Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican who vociferously rallied against the shelter, said that “the re-election of President Trump was the final nail in the coffin to secure this closure, restore order in our community and put American citizens first.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Luis Ferré-Sadurní is a Times reporter covering immigration, focused on the influx of migrants arriving in the New York region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/luis-ferre-sadurni">More about Luis Ferré-Sadurní</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>From Criminal to Power Broker: </strong>John Chan was a Chinatown gangster before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/nyregion/chan-china-nyc-influence.html">remaking himself into a powerful force in New York politics</a> — one closely aligned with the Chinese Communist Party.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Slowdown in Enforcement: </strong>For eight months, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/nyregion/new-jersey-state-police-slowdown.html">traffic enforcement on New Jersey’s highways plummeted</a>.
