South Florida left him with damaged kidneys. It happened again two years later. His doctor, he said, warned that his heart might not survive another episode.</p><p>He is 75 now and still waking up at 5:30 a.m. six days a week to labor in the fields, putting his wizened body through <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/21/us/miami-heat-summer-weather.html" title="">more and more days of extreme heat</a>. Last year, the National Weather Service issued heat advisories for Miami-Dade County on 41 days. This year, it has done so on 63 days, most recently on Sept. 30. Over two days in May, the heat index reached 112 degrees Fahrenheit, breaking the previous daily record by 11 degrees.</p><p>Mid-October is typically the start of a drier, somewhat cooler period in South Florida. For Mr. Delgado, it is a moment of relief. But it is also a time to reflect on what could have been.</p><p>Mr. Delgado used to hope that his story would move policymakers to enact heat protections for outdoor workers. He no longer believes it will.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“They’re in cool air all day,” he said of lawmakers, his voice tinged with bitterness. “They don’t think about who labors to put food on their table.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The heat stroke that Mr. Delgado suffered six years ago after working in a sweet potato field left him with damaged kidneys.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Scott McIntyre for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>His first heat stroke came in 2018, when he lost consciousness and had to be hospitalized. The episode inspired WeCount!, an immigrant and worker advocacy group, to campaign for a local law that would require employers to provide water and rest and shade breaks for Miami-Dade County’s more than 60,000 agriculture and construction workers on excessively hot days.</p><p>Mr. Delgado took a bus from Homestead, Fla., to Miami three times last year to attend public hearings on the proposal. In Miami-Dade County, the heat index — a measure that considers humidity as well as temperature — exceeded 100 degrees <a href="https://climatecenter.fsu.edu/?view=article&amp;id=633:climate-summary-for-florida-july-2023&amp;catid=115&amp;highlight=WyJmbG9yaWRhIiwiZmxvcmlkYSdzIiwiY2xpbWF0ZSIsImZsb3JpZGEgY2xpbWF0ZSJd#:~:text=South%20Florida%20experienced%20record%2Dbreaking,heat%20index%20above%20100%20%CC%8AF." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for 46 consecutive days</a> in 2023, during the state’s hottest summer ever.</p><p>The proposed protections, which would have been some of the strictest in the country, drew national attention.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But they never took effect. Leaders in the agriculture and construction industries said such rules <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/op-ed/article280464019.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">would create</a> “an unneeded burden to thousands of businesses, a bottomless pit of red tape, lost time and money.” A majority of the commissioners signaled that they could not support the rules, even after they were watered down.</p><p>The death knell came in April, when Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/25/climate/extreme-heat-biden-workplace.html" title="">signed legislation</a> banning cities and counties from imposing such protections. He argued that it would be unfair to allow different rules in South Florida than in, say, the Florida Panhandle.</p><p>Mr. Delgado still cannot believe it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Delgado hopes the Biden administration will implement proposed regulations that would, for the first time, require employers to provide rest areas and water when the heat index reaches 80 degrees.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Scott McIntyre for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I don’t understand why they refuse to pass that law,” Mr. Delgado said in Spanish in a recent interview in a sweet potato field in Florida City, just north of the Keys, as the heat index hovered around 106 degrees.</p><p>At least three male farmworkers — a 28-year-old <a href="https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/region4/06282023" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">placing wooden stakes in the ground</a> to support bell peppers, a 26-year-old <a href="https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/region4/04152024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">planting sugar cane</a> and a 41-year-old <a href="https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/region/06262024#:~:text=ARCADIA%2C%20FL%20%E2%80%93%20A%20federal%20workplace,hazards%20associated%20with%20high%20temperatures." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">harvesting oranges</a> — died from heat-related illness in Florida last year, according to the most recent data available from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Lack of precise data <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/us/extreme-heat-deaths.html" title="">makes heat deaths difficult to track</a>, but many outdoor workers have experienced the effects of a warming climate on the human body.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Delgado’s last hope is that the Biden administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/climate/heat-biden-workers-protection.html" title="">will implement proposed regulations</a> that would, for the first time, require employers to provide rest areas and water when the heat index reaches 80 degrees. The regulations could apply to about 35 million Americans.</p><p>But passing rules takes time, and Mr. Delgado is old.</p><p>He began working the land as a 5-year-old in Mexico. His father plowed the fields with oxen, he said.</p><p>He came to the United States in 1988 but did not have legal status until December, according to his lawyer, when he received a temporary work permit under a federal program for noncitizens who have been victims of labor law violations. Mr. Delgado worked for a company that had underpaid him and others after misclassifying them as contract workers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Delgado began working the land as a 5-year-old in Mexico.

Since employers are not required to provide cold water nearby, he packs his own. When he needs shade, he opens a rusty beach umbrella, props it onto the truck bed and lays on the ground.</p><p>On the day of the interview, he bent over and cut sweet potato vines using a sugar cane machete that he sheared down to a smaller size. He would get paid $1.50 per bunch — and an additional 75 cents for each of those that he plants in the following days.</p><p>Taking a break, he fished an ice cube from his cooler to suck on.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>When Mr. Delgado needs shade, he opens a rusty beach umbrella, props it against his truck and lies on the ground underneath it.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Scott McIntyre for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>He rents a room in Homestead and tends to the yard.
