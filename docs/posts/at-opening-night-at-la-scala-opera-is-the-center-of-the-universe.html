But at La Scala, the storied theater that gave world premieres of works by Donizetti, Puccini, Rossini and Verdi, opera can still feel like the center of the cultural universe. It remains a matter of national pride and patrimony, a political football and an obsession for devoted fans.</p><p>“This is sacred for us,” said the critic Alberto Mattioli, who writes for La Stampa, an Italian newspaper. “Opera is our religion.”</p><p>The opening — a glittering affair known as Prima della Scala — is held each year on Dec. 7, the feast of St. Ambrose, Milan’s patron saint. This year’s new production of Verdi’s “<a href="https://www.teatroallascala.org/en/season/2024-2025/opera/la-forza-del-destino.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">La Forza del Destino</a>,” starring the soprano Anna Netrebko and conducted by Riccardo Chailly, drew its share of pageantry and pomp.</p><p>Here’s a look at the spectacle, the politics and the superstition.</p><h2 id="link-9c63b3a">‘The Oscars of Milan’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/11/multimedia/LASCALA-07-wlvz/LASCALA-07-wlvz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/11/multimedia/LASCALA-07-wlvz/LASCALA-07-wlvz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/11/multimedia/LASCALA-07-wlvz/LASCALA-07-wlvz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A woman in a blue fur-trimmed gown and a tiara stands behind an usher in a black cape wearing a medallion on a gold chain." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/11/multimedia/LASCALA-07-wlvz/LASCALA-07-wlvz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/11/multimedia/LASCALA-07-wlvz/LASCALA-07-wlvz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/11/multimedia/LASCALA-07-wlvz/LASCALA-07-wlvz-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 683w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/11/multimedia/LASCALA-07-wlvz/LASCALA-07-wlvz-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1366w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/ef361910-0c38-5ffe-8aee-907c985e6ed9" decoding="async" width="600" height="900"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The opening night crowd is typically dressed to the nines, ensuring that the event is covered by fashion writers as well as music critics.  </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maurizio Fiorino for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Standing to one side of the red carpet, the writer Mattia Boffi, dressed in a bejeweled white shirt and a matching cape, assessed the looks of arriving celebrities: politicians, leaders of finance and design, media moguls, television personalities and actors, dressed in Giorgio Armani suits and Alexander McQueen dresses.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Crowds watched a simulcast of the performance in the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, the luxe shopping concourse between the opera house and the Duomo.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maurizio Fiorino for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Canio Romaniello, who has been photographing La Scala’s opening since 1988, moved acrobatically around the small, packed lobby with his Canon camera.</p><p>“Ragazzi!” he shouted, working to get the attention of celebrities and instructing them to move closer.

Many said there was nothing quite like Verdi, who has deep ties to the opera house: his first opera, “Oberto,” had its premiere there in 1839, and his last opera, “Falstaff,” premiered there in 1893.</p><p>“Verdi is the best we could expect,” said Davide Cafiero, a pianist who lives in Milan. “He is one of us.”</p><p>Rodolfo Rocchi, who watched “Forza” from the uppermost balcony, has been a regular at La Scala since 1954. The highlight of his opera-going life came the following year, when he heard Maria Callas perform in Bellini’s “La Sonnambula.” He was so moved, he claimed, that a fellow audience member had to hold onto the tails of his jacket so he would not fall over.</p><p>Rocchi lamented that opera had become less a part of mainstream culture in Italy in recent years. But he said there was nothing like La Scala.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“It’s my house,” he said. “This is where I feel alive.”</p><h2 id="link-32db7367">War, Politics and Protests</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Carabinieri stand guard in dress uniforms with capes, sashes, and plumed hats.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maurizio Fiorino for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>It was a rainy day in Milan.

Sing for justice, not for Netrebko’s complicity.”</p><p>Maria Mikaelyan, who helped organize the protest, said she hoped to be heard by the Italian authorities and public. She praised Netrebko’s singing: “She is the best soprano in the world — nobody can doubt that.” But she said Netrebko should acknowledge “in front of the world that is watching from the La Scala stage” that she made a mistake by supporting Putin.</p><p>“I hope she’d find some courage to do that as soon as possible,” Mikaelyan said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The police stood guard outside the opera house, since its opening night regularly draws protests seeking to draw attention to various causes. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alessandro Garofalo/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Dominique Meyer, the chief executive and artistic director of La Scala, later defended Netrebko after there were scattered boos during the curtain call.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“I don’t appreciate a show being held hostage like this,” he said. “There isn’t a Netrebko in every generation.

Before the start of “Forza,” a shout erupted from somewhere in the auditorium: “<a href="https://www.ilmessaggero.it/italia/prima_della_scala_2024_urlo_pubblico_salvare_sant_agata_villa_verdi_perche_cosa_e_successo-8525657.html?refresh_ce" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Save Sant’Agata</a>,” a reference to the stalled efforts to reopen the museum in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/29/arts/music/giuseppe-verdi-pilgrimage-italy.html" title="">the villa where Verdi lived, farmed and wrote some of his greatest works</a>, which has been closed to the public.</p><h2 id="link-7a6d0d01">A Cursed Opera?</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dvora Ancona said that she dressed in mirrors to ward off any bad luck associated with the opera, Verdi’s “La Forza del Destino.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maurizio Fiorino for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“Forza” is considered by some to be unlucky — inspiring the kind of superstitions in parts of the opera world that Shakespeare’s “Macbeth” does in the theater world.
