</span>. </p>

<p>These two teams previously met three times in VCT EMEA, with all three encounters going the way of the more experienced Heretics. This time, on a much grander stage, after both teams suffered 2-0 losses just yesterday, Heretics won the battle of resilience 2-1 to end GIANTX&#39;s year.</p>

<p>The series kicked off on GIANTX&#39;s map pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542274/team-heretics-vs-giantx-valorant-champions-2025-lr1/?game=233486&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Ascent</a>, which had been a strong map for them in the group stage. They opened with a pistol but lost the eco round immediately after, giving way to a torrent of six rounds in a row for Heretics as they locked down both sites. GIANTX scraped together a couple of rounds, but the half was out of their hands, ending 8-4. </p>

<p>The second pistol went the way of Heretics, promising a swift end to the map as Los Niños closed it out 13-4. <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/10971/riens">
		RieNs	</a>
</span> in particular put up an unbelievable performance on Sova all map, winning multiple crucial rounds almost on his own in both halves including a Stinger 4K on the bonus in round 15. Statistically, the Initiator scored a 23/8/4 KDA, 224 ADR, and a 1.84 rating.</p>


<p><em>RieNs makes magic with a Stinger to crush GIANTX.</em></p>

<p>The next map was <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542274/team-heretics-vs-giantx-valorant-champions-2025-lr1/?game=233487&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Lotus</a>, where Heretics continued to lean into their unique Deadlock-Chamber composition. The map was another stomp, but it turned out to be a stomp for GIANTX. They masterfully took advantage of their opponents&#39; weak points around the map, disrespecting the Deadlock utility, rooting out the Chamber, and bowling Heretics over just about everywhere they went to win seven consecutive rounds for a 9-3 lead at the half.</p>

<p>Much like Heretics in the first map, GIANTX sprinted to a win with a pistol and bonus for an even more dominant 13-3 victory. Every player on GIANTX put up numbers, but <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/11332/ara">
		ara	</a>
</span>&#39;s entries were a key piece of the puzzle, the Raze recording 5-0 in first kills to first deaths and 183 ADR. </p>

<p>While the first two maps were as one-sided as they could&#39;ve been, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542274/team-heretics-vs-giantx-valorant-champions-2025-lr1/?game=233488&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Bind</a> was a slugfest. After not having played the map since Week 4 of Stage 2, Heretics opted to copy the <span data-ref-id="4">

</span> patented Waylay-Yoru composition versus GIANTX&#39;s Gekko and Deadlock.</p>

<p>The start of the map favored GIANTX, who at one point led 5-2 after winning a fourth pistol in the series and shutting down Heretics&#39; attempts to enter the sites. After a Heretics timeout, the rest of the half was back-and-forth, pitting GIANTX&#39;s proactive pushes around the map against Heretics&#39; quick reactions. In the end, GIANTX held fast to a slight 7-5 lead.</p>

<p>Round 17 was the start of a string of frenzied rounds that all kept going the way of Heretics, featuring two consecutive full stick defuses from Boo in rounds 17 and 18, a Seize-Orbital Strike combination that caught GIANTX but also took the life of <span data-ref-id="5">

<p><em>The captain of Los Niños withstands the Snake Bite for another full stick.</em></p>

<p>Thriving in the chaos, Heretics came out on top, winning Bind 13-9 and eliminating their EMEA compatriots from the tournament.</p>

<p>After the match, Boo cited experience as a key factor to Heretics&#39; resilience in the final map. “Crazy game, but…we just kept believing, and I think that&#39;s why we won,” he said.</p>

<p>GIANTX&#39;s year will come to an end in the top eight of Champions, marking a tremendous turnaround for them after they finished <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2380/vct-2025-emea-stage-1/group-stage" target="_blank">Stage 1</a> in the bottom four of EMEA just five months ago. Heretics will continue to fight for their lives in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542277/team-heretics-vs-tbd-valorant-champions-2025-lr2" target="_blank">lower bracket</a> on Sept. 29, where they will face the loser of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542268/fnatic-vs-paper-rex-valorant-champions-2025-ubsf" target="_blank">FNATIC versus Paper Rex</a>.</p>
