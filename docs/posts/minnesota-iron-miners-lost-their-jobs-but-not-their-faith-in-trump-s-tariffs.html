The ore, extracted and crushed, is further processed, shipped, smelted in a blast furnace, transformed into steel, then taken to assembly lines, where it is shaped into appliances and automobiles.</p><p>But demand for cars and other big-ticket, metal-filled items slumped in 2024, a rough year for the industry. The steel manufacturer Cleveland-Cliffs, which owns the mine where Mr. Bird works, reported a $483 million loss for the first three months of 2025, which meant jobs were on the line, including his.</p><p>When Mr. Bird, 33, found out that he was being laid off, he did not hear it from “Cliffs.” he said. Rather, he learned about it in a breaking news segment on the local television station, WDIO, while with his children on one of his days off. Some 1,200 Cleveland-Cliffs employees were affected, 600 them in Minnesota.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It’s a hell of a way to find out you’re losing your job,” he said. “It feels like a slap in the face, honestly, from corporate America.”</p><p>Yet one thing currently uniting Cleveland-Cliffs and Mr. Bird, a member of the United Steelworkers union, is support for President Trump’s tariffs: a 25 percent tax on steel and aluminum imports along with a 25 percent tariff on all imported cars.</p><p>A wide range of economists think that Mr. Trump’s global tariff campaign could hasten an economic downturn, even as he has rolled back its most extreme, across-the-board elements over the past month. A prolonged downturn, or mere slowdown, could further dampen demand for steel products.</p><p>Both the steel companies and the steelworkers’ union, however, believe that tariffs can help protect, and even revitalize, domestic production over the long run.

While tariffs are expected to dampen the American appetite for Chinese steel this year, according to <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/metals/041724-us-tariff-china-impact-trade-tension-steel-copper-aluminum-soybeans-ethane-lng-cleantech" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysts at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights</a>, American steel and auto producers are also being hit with higher costs for the imported parts and finished goods that they use.</p><p>People in support of tariffs are making a bet, to one extent or another, that the domestic ecosystem of mining workers and steel companies can<span>  </span>survive what the president calls “a transition” and come out the better for it.</p><p>“We firmly believe that the Trump administration is spot-on in its push to bring back manufacturing to the United States” in the long term, Lourenco Goncalves, the chief executive of Cleveland-Cliffs, <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4783729-cleveland-cliffs-inc-clf-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript?open_reset_password=false&amp;origin=confirm_registration&amp;source=email_registration_email:confirm_registration&amp;utm_campaign=%7Cconfirmation_link_registration&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=seeking_alpha" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told analysts</a> on a recent earnings call.<span>  </span>“However, in the short term, we need to do everything we can to make sure that we remain cost competitive.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>That means the months ahead will be trickier than usual for people like Mr. Bird. His family will “hunker down” with unemployment benefits and a layoff supplement from the steelworkers’ union until Mr. Bird’s wife, who is finishing nursing school, starts looking for work this summer.</p><p>But if the demand for American steel doesn’t increase, “well, then you’re faced with the decision of ‘I might have to leave,’” Mr. Bird said. “You know, at our union meetings, they told us the harsh reality of ‘You might not see some of these people ever again.’”</p><h2 id="link-7bae8c30">A Trickle-Down Economy</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Businesses in downtown Chisholm, Minn.

In preparation, Minnesota legislators are debating proposals to extend the miners’ unemployment insurance benefits until late December, beyond the usual 26 weeks.</p><p>Keeping skilled miners in the region is a bipartisan priority, from the office of the Democratic governor, Tim Walz, in the state capital in St. Paul to red rural stretches far north. Mining has a small footprint in terms of total employment in the state. But the fear is that if mining withers away in the face of foreign competition, then much of northern Minnesota may end up hollowed out like some other parts of the upper Midwest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“If we do not get this extension and provide hope to our members, they will not be able to stay, as a lot of them are young, with children,” Al King, the president of United Steelworkers Local 6115, said during a state legislative committee hearing in April.</p><p>A common complaint by economists about protectionist policies is that the “wage premium” for most manufacturing jobs is often overstated and that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/business/economy/trump-tariffs-us-manufacturing-economy.html" title="">populist nostalgia for a bygone manufacturing heyday</a> is misplaced. But unionized mining jobs in the Iron Range still pay well.</p><p>Mr. Bird makes anywhere from $112,000 to $125,000 a year with overtime. That is <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/stlouiscountyminnesota/PST040223" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">well over the per capita income</a> of $39,778 in St. Louis County, or the <a href="https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/27137" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$61,140</a> typical of someone working in maintenance and repair jobs.</p><p>“Mining is a trickle-down economy,” said Teresa Appelwick, the president of the Laurentian Chamber of Commerce, which represents businesses in the “Quad Cities” of the range and “does not have an official stance” on Mr. Trump’s tariff campaign.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-13"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A haul truck on display near the Hull Rust Mine in Hibbing, Minn.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A portion of taconite, a type of iron ore, sparkling in the sun in Mountain Iron, which calls itself the “Taconite Capital of the World.”</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>The longer miners are idled, she said, the more the next-best-paying jobs may falter because much of their business ripples out from mining activity: welders, metal fabricators, equipment distributors, construction firms, tire companies, heating and cooling systems operators, pipe fitters.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Darrell Gustafson, 50, from Hibbing, Minn., worked in construction for much of his life. But the past 13 years as a miner offered a salary that put him on a trajectory to comfortably manage retirement. He felt “blindsided,” he said, when he was laid off in March.</p><p>Grabbing lunch with his girlfriend at Sportsmen’s, a main street haunt in Hibbing, he lamented how the auto and appliances markets had “tanked.” Yet he, too, is in support of high steel tariffs.</p><p>“Everyone’s shocked at having tariffs, but why was it OK for them to free trade but we get charged for our goods overseas?” Mr. Gustafson said. He did add, however, that the rollout of tariff policy so far left “a lot of unanswered questions.”</p><h2 id="link-6dfedbac">Diversifying the Economy</h2></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-17"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/16/16visualUploader-33507-cover/16visualUploader-33507-cover-superJumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/16/16visualUploader-33507-cover/16visualUploader-33507-cover-superJumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/05/16/140194_1_16visualUploader-33507_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Miriam and Peter Kero cycling through Redhead Mountain Bike Park, carved from the remade walls of a sprawling old mining pit.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Dozens of employers showed up at the 2025 Iron Range Job Fair on April 24.

A “sprinkle” of miners stopped by, said Ms. Appelwick of the Chamber of Commerce, which was among the hosts of the event. But most laid-off miners are waiting it out, hoping to return to the good job that many feel they still have.</p><p>Mining is a cyclical industry, and people in the region have grown somewhat accustomed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/07/us/recession-silences-the-mines-of-the-minnesota-iron-range.html" title="">drastic dips</a> over the years.

Many hospitality jobs, she acknowledged, do not always pay well enough to save and raise families — even in an area with a low cost of living compared with big metro areas.
