Walker’s automatons enact stubbornly human rituals that run the gamut from baptisms to the self-soothing of a child holding a doll, and they do so while standing atop fragments of obsidian (a volcanic glass believed in mystical circles to have trauma-absorbing properties).</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/26/multimedia/26kara-walker-sfmoma-01-zqfj/26kara-walker-sfmoma-01-zqfj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/26/multimedia/26kara-walker-sfmoma-01-zqfj/26kara-walker-sfmoma-01-zqfj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/26/multimedia/26kara-walker-sfmoma-01-zqfj/26kara-walker-sfmoma-01-zqfj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="The artist Kara Walker, in an all-black attire and pink hair, sits cross-legged on the floor with her hands folded in front of her." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/26/multimedia/26kara-walker-sfmoma-01-zqfj/26kara-walker-sfmoma-01-zqfj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/26/multimedia/26kara-walker-sfmoma-01-zqfj/26kara-walker-sfmoma-01-zqfj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/26/multimedia/26kara-walker-sfmoma-01-zqfj/26kara-walker-sfmoma-01-zqfj-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 683w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/26/multimedia/26kara-walker-sfmoma-01-zqfj/26kara-walker-sfmoma-01-zqfj-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1366w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="900"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kara Walker in 2022.

So is “Fortuna,” which like Walker’s previous installations has an extended, carnivalesque title: “Fortuna and the Immortality Garden (Machine) / A Respite for the Weary Time-Traveler. / Featuring a Rite of Ancient Intelligence Carried out by The Gardeners / Toward the Continued Improvement of the Human Specious / by Kara E-Walker.”</p><p>Comparing “Fortuna” to Walker’s earlier big commissions, however, reveals an evolution in her approach to public art — as well as our own. “Sugar Baby,” a kind of monument to the unsung workers of the Domino Sugar Factory in Brooklyn, was, in my recollection, one of the first large public sculptures to have a similarly outsized presence on social media. “Fortuna” takes a decidedly un-monumental turn, with figures that are only slightly larger than life-size, and in doing so captures something of the way in which A.I. and other new technologies are increasingly baked into our bodily experience.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A robot girl confers with her doll as a healing ritual takes place behind her in Kara Walker’s “Fortuna and the Immortality Garden (Machine).” Each of the seven “gardeners” in Walker’s piece are uniquely animated as the cycle repeats itself.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Marissa Leshnov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Intertwining the digital and the handmade, techno-optimism and techno-pessimism, illness and recovery, and — most profoundly — the histories of slavery and robotics, “Fortuna” demands much more of us than many other “interactive” installations. Up on SFMOMA’s sixth floor, visitors queue to be allotted their couple of minutes inside Yayoi Kusama’s peppy room of suspended polka dots. They will need more time and, certainly, more emotional bandwidth to experience Walker’s piece, with its stop-and-start performances and halting transfigurations, which is on view in the museum’s ground-floor Roberts Family Gallery and can be entered directly from the street without paying admission.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Some of Walker’s references in “Fortuna” are types of mass entertainment that might not seem particularly complex: arcade games, natural history dioramas, and the kid-centered restaurant chain Chuck E. Cheese, to name a few. Walker was born and partly raised in Stockton, Calif., and her memories of visits to San Francisco’s <a href="https://museemecanique.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Musée Mécanique</a> and the <a href="https://www.calacademy.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">California Academy of Sciences</a> inform the installation.</p><p>The fortunetelling automaton that is the project’s namesake looms over visitors, rotating and gesticulating ominously before eventually releasing from its mouth a slip of paper with a printed fortune. (Mine read “Perhaps you are unique”; others scattered around the base of the figure proclaimed “The Cyborg Savior! Rise Up!” and “Prayers are blind.”) Walker composed some 100 of these teasing bits of verbiage, initially using ChatGPT but eventually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/arts/design/kara-walker-museums-robotics-san-francisco-art-black-people.html" title="">writing them herself</a> when the A.I. did not meet her expectations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-9"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/23/26kara-walker-vid2-81126-cover/26kara-walker-vid2-81126-cover-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/23/26kara-walker-vid2-81126-cover/26kara-walker-vid2-81126-cover-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/09/23/124897_1_26kara-walker-vid2-81126_wg_360p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Walker’s automatons enact human rituals that run the gamut from baptisms to the self-soothing of a child holding a doll.

Walker collaborated with the technical lead <a href="https://www.newinc.org/year-10-mentors/noah-feehan" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Noah Feehan</a> in an elaborate, back-and-forth process involving both software programmed by Feehan and Walker’s manipulation of colored paper cutouts on a foamcore board. The result appears both random and schematic; some of the dolls’ individual movements may repeat during a typical visit, but their interactions with each other don’t exactly. In the rare moments when they seem to synchronize, there is a jam-session vibe reminiscent of Ragnar Kjartansson’s multichannel video installation <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/ragnar-kjartansson-the-visitors/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“The Visitors,”</a> up on the museum’s sixth floor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-12"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A swaying automaton named Fortuna looms over visitors, rotating and gesticulating before eventually releasing from its mouth a slip of paper with a printed fortune.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Photo by Fredrik Nilsen Studio, via Sikkema Jenkins &amp; Co. and Sprüth Magers</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A sampling of the printed fortunes collected at the base of Fortuna.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Marissa Leshnov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Walker has given the robots names, which correspond to their ritualistic sounds and gestures. Harpy plucks the strings of an instrument set into her stomach; the Belltoller sounds a chime with a knock of his fist; the Whisperer confers with her doll; and the Waterbearer balances an imaginary burden on her shoulders. Central to the action are the Levitator and the Magician, who enact and re-enact a shaky, flailing resurrection more haunting than their names would suggest.</p><p>“My automatons reference an eternally retrospective blackness — archetypes, rather than stereotypes,” Walker says in her interview with Joo. “They don’t resemble the model of robust superhuman robots that the industry has long promised or threatened us with.”</p><p>Two stand apart from the main display: the prognosticating Fortuna, spitting out her cryptic bits of content, and the abject Dover, whose doubled-over figure evokes addiction with a shocking specificity. His presence, and his position by a street-facing window, suggest that Walker is addressing current-day San Francisco as well as more far-reaching histories and geographies of innovation and subordination.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The sculpted head for Fortuna, which was then scanned and 3-D printed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Photo by Ari Marcopoulos, via Sikkema Jenkins &amp; Co. and Sprüth Magers</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Like Fortuna, perhaps, Walker is also speaking to the future. Although her installation borrows from the arcade games and other cheap thrills of the last century or two, it has a key textual source in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/17/arts/octavia-butler-vision-kindred.html" title="">Octavia E. Butler</a>’s speculative novel “Parable of the Sower.” Published in 1993 but set in 2024-27, the dystopian tale follows a Black Californian teenager’s struggle to endure and form community in the wreckage of climate change, authoritarianism and socioeconomic crisis.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Walker’s vision of the not-too-distant future is more ambiguous, and ultimately as confounding as Fortuna’s.
