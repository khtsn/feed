When he woke up on Sunday morning, he was something of an internet celebrity.</p><p>Mr. Epstein was the subject of a “Saturday Night Live” sketch this weekend that spoofed his name — a somewhat unfortunate mash-up of the names of two notorious sexual predators, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/nyregion/weinstein-new-york-case-timeline-metoo.html" title="">Harvey Weinstein</a> and Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>The show’s host, the comedian John Mulaney, starred as Harvey Epstein in a campaign ad featuring the candidate struggling to explain to voters that he is neither of the disgraced men. Harvey Epstein is running for the New York City Council in District 2, which includes Greenwich Village, the Lower East Side and parts of southeastern Manhattan.</p><p>“Look is my name ideal? Of course not,” Mr. Mulaney says in the sketch as he walks down a street in a bald cap and hoop earrings to mimic the assemblyman’s look. “I share names with two of the most notorious sex perverts of all time.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He adds, “But thankfully, I’m a different guy.”</p><p>The camera pans to two lawn signs — one for Harvey Epstein and another that reads “No Relation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The real Harvey Epstein, who is a regular “S.N.L.” viewer, said in an interview on Sunday that he had no idea the sketch was planned. He went to bed Saturday night before the show aired and woke up very early Sunday to “hundreds and hundreds and hundreds” of text messages telling him to watch.</p><p>“So I watched it and I’m like, ‘Oh, my God, that’s me,’” he said. “It was, like, ridiculously funny. I couldn’t stop laughing.”</p><p>Mr. Epstein, a Democrat who has served in the State Assembly since 2018, is unopposed on the ballot this Tuesday for the Assembly, but he plans to give up that seat if he is elected to the Council.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He said that throughout his political career, people have often asked if he was related to Jeffrey Epstein, the financier who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/01/business/01epstein.html" title="">had to register as a sex offender</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-charges.html" title="">was charged</a> with sex trafficking after he was accused of preying on girls as young as 14. He was found dead in his jail cell in Manhattan in 2019, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-death-report.html" title="">his death was ruled a suicide</a>.</p><p>Others have confused the state assemblyman’s name with that of Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced Hollywood mogul who was convicted of sex crimes in California and New York. The New York <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-conviction-appeal.html" title="">conviction was overturned</a>, and Mr. Weinstein was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/nyregion/weinstein-trial-combined-sex-assault-charges.html" title="">charged with a new sex crime</a> in Manhattan last month.</p><p>In the wake of the publicity over the sketch, Harvey Epstein encouraged people to support survivors of sexual assault.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Harvey4council/status/1853123478972440972" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a> on Sunday, he encouraged donations to an anti-sexual assault nonprofit. “All joking aside, I hope my newfound followers will consider donating to RAINN, who do extremely valuable work supporting survivors,” he wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>John Mulaney, center, as Harvey Epstein in the “Saturday Night Live” sketch.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">NBC Universal</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Epstein said he received at least 400 new followers on X on Sunday morning alone, momentum that he seized upon in a post sharing the sketch with a link to his City Council campaign donations page. He is gearing up for the Democratic primary for the Council seat in June.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I’m 57 years old. I’ve been Harvey Epstein my whole life,” he said. “I have a really lovely reputation in the neighborhood, and people know me for who I am.”</p><p>He is running in a crowded primary to replace Councilwoman Carlina Rivera, who is term-limited. He said he hopes to use his higher profile to drive home the issues at the core of his platform, including tenants’ rights.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maia Coleman writes about breaking news and the criminal justice system in New York City and its surrounding areas.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maia-coleman">More about Maia Coleman</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
