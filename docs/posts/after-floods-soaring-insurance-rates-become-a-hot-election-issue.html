So Ms. Burnside, a lifelong Republican, voted along party lines.</p><p>She now considers many of her area’s elected Republicans responsible for rubber-stamping too many development projects. And she is furious that they have failed to tame home insurance premiums, which have soared by 75 percent. That was why she accepted an invitation to a friend’s recent beach house party for State Senator Natasha Marcus, a Democrat who is challenging the state’s Republican insurance commissioner.</p><p>“She just gave me lots to think about,” Ms. Burnside, 59, said after listening to Ms. Marcus’s warnings about loopholes that hurt policyholders and rates in coastal areas that are likely to see a significant rise. “More people, more claims, more raises — it’s all connected.”</p><p>Eleven states elect their insurance commissioners, an obscure but powerful job that affects virtually every resident through regulations and the ability to challenge or reject rate hikes on home, car and other policies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The contest has typically been treated as a down-ballot afterthought involving little-known candidates, with hundreds of thousands of voters leaving their ballots blank.

Auto insurance rates are among the nation’s lowest.</p><p>The state’s <a href="https://www.ncjua-nciua.org" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nonprofit insurer of last resort</a> — a tax-exempt association of insurance companies that are required by law to insure properties and spread the risk — had <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/real-estate-news/article288501557.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enough cash to pay $1.5 billion in wind and hail claims</a> after Hurricane Florence ravaged the state in 2018.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>But in 2023, Nationwide decided <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/real-estate-news/article279932479.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not to renew 10,000 homeowners’ insurance policies</a> in eastern North Carolina, citing climate and other reasons.

But while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/13/climate/home-insurance-profit-us-states-weather.html" title="">insurers have seen profits in 10 out of the last 11 years</a> in North Carolina, they lost money in 18 other states in 2023, up from eight in 2013, according to an analysis by The New York Times.</p><p>Against that backdrop, the North Carolina <a href="https://www.ncrb.org/ncrb/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rate Bureau</a>, a nonprofit consortium of insurers empowered by the State Legislature to calculate adjustments in premiums, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-homeowners-insurance-rate-proposal-cf7e5785d252d3bfc631713ebee8ce2e" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">requested a 42 percent increase</a> in January — including 99 percent in some coastal areas — citing inflation and increased costs for materials and labor. Since then, 40,000 emails, phone calls and letters have inundated the Department of Insurance, which, as the state’s regulator, must approve any increases.</p><p>Mr. Causey, a former health insurance executive, has preferred to negotiate the policies affecting the state’s housing stock. In May, he negotiated <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/insurance-commissioner-mike-causey-has-approved-average-8-dwelling-rate-increase/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an 8 percent increase in the rate that applies primarily to rental properties</a>, down from an original request of more than 50 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In 2020, the last time homeowners’ insurance rates were increased, a 24.5 percent request was whittled down to 7.9 percent.</p><p>But Mr. Causey rejected this year’s proposal to increase homeowners’ insurance rates by 42 percent, <a href="https://www.starnewsonline.com/story/news/local/2024/10/02/hearing-slated-for-coastal-insurance-rate-hike-in-north-carolina/75189630007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">setting the stage for his first public judicial hearing</a> on rate hikes on Oct. 7.</p><p>“I very much understand where the people are coming from because we’re all paying higher insurance rates, and inflation is the driving factor that’s hurting all Americans,” Mr. Causey, 74, said in an interview a few weeks before the hearing.</p><p>But Ms. Marcus has been on the attack, accusing Mr. Causey of approving too many rate increases without holding public hearings. She talks about a little-understood Consent to Rate law — which was <a href="https://www.ncdoi.gov/documents/legislative-services/18-b-08-consent-rate/open" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">amended by the Legislature in 2018</a>, with Mr. Causey’s input — being <a href="https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/jir-za-39-03-el-consent-rate-nc-homeowners.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">used increasingly by insurers in North Carolina</a> to <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article265676886.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">charge homeowners more</a> than the rates approved by the state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Marcus, the Democratic nominee for North Carolina Insurance Commissioner, speaks with a roof evaluator, Jeff Finch.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cornell Watson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Marcus meets with residents at a house in Holden Beach.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cornell Watson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>While Mr. Causey has often worked closely with his fellow Republicans who have long dominated the Legislature, he <a href="https://portcitydaily.com/local-news/2024/07/28/lobbyist-written-building-code-law-could-increase-homeowner-insurance-limit-grant-opportunities/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sided with Gov.

Ms. Marcus says that the state needs to invest more in hardening homes, and that flood maps are woefully outdated.</p><p>Much of Helene’s damage was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/27/weather/hurricane-helene-florida?searchResultPosition=4#along-helenes-destructive-path-fewer-homeowners-have-flood-insurance" title="">caused by flooding</a>, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/hurricane-helene-shows-insurance-industry-that-no-homes-are-safe-north-carolina/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">few people in western North Carolina</a> had taken out federal flood insurance, which is not within the purview of the state insurance commissioner. Still, the storm was clearly on the candidates’ minds on Monday, when Mr. Causey and Ms. Marcus <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/10/08/candidates-for-insurance-commissioner-spar-over-proposed-42-2-average-homeowner-rate-increase/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">held separate</a> news conferences before the rate increase hearing.</p><p>The proposed rate hikes, which were requested at the beginning of the year, were much lower in western North Carolina than along the coast. So when asked whether Helene would be a factor in future insurance-rate increases, Mr. Causey said, “It very well could be.” But he also cautioned that it was too early to know.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“We’re just now seeing impacts from Hurricane Florence, and that was back in 2018, so we have to wait and see how it shakes out,” <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/real-estate-news/article293622974.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said</a>.</p><p>Part of an insurance commissioner’s job is to <a href="https://www.wbtv.com/2024/09/30/north-carolina-insurance-commissioner-steps-victims-helene-should-take/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">visit storm-hit areas</a> and set up victim assistance centers to help residents with insurance claims and other needs.
