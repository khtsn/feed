The security service said that Russian forces had used chemical weapons on the battlefield more than 4,800 times since the war began, on General Kirillov’s orders. Russia denied Ukraine’s accusations during a July meeting of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.</p><p>Ukraine has said the chemical weapons used by Russia often include combat grenades equipped with the irritant chemical agents CS and CN. Those tear gases, most commonly used by riot police officers to control crowds, are banned in warfare under the Chemical Weapons Convention, an arms control treaty ratified by more than 150 countries, including Russia.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/world/europe/us-russia-chemical-weapons-ukraine.html" title="">The U.S. State Department said this spring</a> that Russia had used chloropicrin, a choking agent widely used in World War I, as well as tear gas on the battlefield.
