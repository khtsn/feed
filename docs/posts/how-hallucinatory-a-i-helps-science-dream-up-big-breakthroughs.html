    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><div aria-live="polite"><p>You have a preview view of this article while we are checking your access.

The plausible fakes have roiled not only chatbot sessions but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/nyregion/avianca-airline-lawsuit-chatgpt.html" title="">lawsuits</a> and medical <a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/hallucinations-in-ai-generated-medical-summaries-remain-a-grave-concern/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">records</a>. For a time last year, a patently false claim from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/21/technology/google-bard-chatbot.html" title="">a new Google chatbot</a> helped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/15/podcasts/the-daily/chat-gpt-microsoft-bing-artificial-intelligence.html?showTranscript=1" title="">drive down</a> the company’s market value by an estimated $100 billion.</p><p>In the universe of science, however, innovators are finding that A.I. hallucinations can be remarkably useful. The smart machines, it turns out, are dreaming up riots of unrealities that help scientists track cancer, design drugs, invent medical devices, uncover weather phenomena and even win the Nobel Prize.</p><p>“The public thinks it’s all bad,” said <a href="https://mcgovern-fagg.org/amy/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amy McGovern</a>, a computer scientist who directs a federal <a href="https://www.ai2es.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A.I. institute</a>. “But it’s actually giving scientists new ideas. It’s giving them the chance to explore ideas they might not have thought about otherwise.”</p><p>The public image of science is coolly analytic. Less visibly, the early stages of discovery can teem with hunches and wild guesswork. “Anything goes” is how Paul Feyerabend, a philosopher of science, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.386510" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">once characterized</a> the free-for-all.</p><p>Now, A.I. hallucinations are reinvigorating the creative side of science. They speed the process by which scientists and inventors dream up new ideas and test them to see if reality concurs. It’s the <a href="https://www2.nau.edu/lrm22/lessons/scientific_method/scientific_method.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scientific method</a> — only supercharged. What once took years can now be done in days, hours and minutes. In some cases, the accelerated cycles of inquiry help scientists open new frontiers.</p><p>“We’re exploring,” said <a href="https://be.mit.edu/faculty/james-j-collins/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">James J. Collins</a>, an M.I.T. professor who <a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/5IGp0ZBvJ_9Skf2mALxdtOWIcQLGDdmNaDkx3WbOpI8cGoFsO9FYmC-bov6_lgZPKmEcZ1a_qHSfRiHcpaOwcZ1JNCQ?loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;ts=1348.27" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently praised hallucinations</a> for speeding his research into novel antibiotics. “We’re asking the models to come up with completely new molecules.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="Optimistic-2"><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
