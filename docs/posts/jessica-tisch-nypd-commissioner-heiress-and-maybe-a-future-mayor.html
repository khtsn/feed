    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Jessica S. Tisch, the billionaire heiress who is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/nyregion/jessica-tisch-nypd-commissioner.html" title="">commissioner of the New York Police Department</a>, had just walked into the dining hall on one of her first days at Harvard when she was accosted with an unmannerly question: How much did she weigh?</p><p>She was taken aback, but it turned out that the men’s lightweight crew team was looking for a coxswain, who shouts orders to the rowers. They needed someone both light and commanding. “They described it to me as, ‘You sit in front of the boat and you tell everyone what to do,’” she recalled in a recent interview.</p><p>It had definite appeal.</p><p>“I ended up being pretty good at it because of my personality,” she said. “I didn’t use my muscles so much. I used my voice and my brain.” In the end, she concluded, it was “quite the foreshadow” of an unlikely and remarkable career.</p><p>Commissioner Tisch, 44, is now five months into a job running the nation’s largest police department and telling nearly 50,000 civilian and uniformed employees what to do. Taking command of an agency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/nyregion/jessica-tisch-nypd-commissioner.html" title="">rocked by scandals</a> and the departure of three commissioners over two years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/nyregion/nypd-comissioner-jessica-tisch.html" title="">she has already shaken up the staff</a> and managed her first crisis, the hunt for a man charged with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/nyregion/luigi-mangione-murder-charges.html" title="">assassinating a United Healthcare executive</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The question is whether a woman with three Harvard degrees, a $12 million Upper East Side duplex and no experience as a uniformed officer can succeed in one of the city’s toughest jobs. Her success will be defined in large part by how well she cleans up the battered department and how much she brings down the crime rate, both tall orders in New York.</p><p>Her task is more complicated because she reports to Mayor Eric Adams, a former police captain who until recently was under federal indictment. The mayor, who appointed Commissioner Tisch, is now the beneficiary of the Trump Justice Department, which successfully <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/nyregion/eric-adams-case-dismissed.html" title="">urged a judge to drop the corruption charges against him</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00met-tisch-02-cwpf/00met-tisch-02-cwpf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00met-tisch-02-cwpf/00met-tisch-02-cwpf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00met-tisch-02-cwpf/00met-tisch-02-cwpf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Jessica Tisch at a crime scene with other officers." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00met-tisch-02-cwpf/00met-tisch-02-cwpf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00met-tisch-02-cwpf/00met-tisch-02-cwpf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00met-tisch-02-cwpf/00met-tisch-02-cwpf-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00met-tisch-02-cwpf/00met-tisch-02-cwpf-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/7fc001ab-aa08-5cc3-b18a-880f9f251fb5" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jessica Tisch has to negotiate New York’s perilous political currents even as she fights crime.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Commissioner Tisch speaks to the mayor daily, but has said little about the Trump administration letting Mr. Adams off the hook. “I don’t want to talk about it,” she said in the interview.</p><p>She, too, is under pressure from a White House that wants local law enforcement officials to help with roundups of undocumented immigrants, a job she adamantly says does not belong to her department. She has had a video call with Thomas D. Homan, the hard-line “border czar” carrying out what the White House hopes will be the largest deportation effort in history. She described their conversation, initiated at Mr. Homan’s request, only as “short and formal,” with no official requests, at least so far.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“We will not engage in civil immigration enforcement, period,” she said in the interview.</p><p>There are other headaches: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/nyregion/nypd-overtime-hiring.html" title="">recruitment problems,</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/22/nyregion/new-york-police-department-maddrey.html" title="">excessive police overtime,</a> <a href="https://therecord.media/nypd-drones-as-first-responders-911-calls-privacy-surveillance" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">complaints about increased surveillance</a>, a jump in rapes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/nyregion/nyc-shootings-decrease-first-quarter.html" title="">even though most crime is down</a>. There is also a distracting (although flattering) chorus, including <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/22/opinion/new-yorkers-deserve-a-competent-choice-for-mayor-jessica-tisch-should-run/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from The New York Post</a> — where Commissioner Tisch once worked as a summer intern writing weekend feature stories — to run for her boss’s current job.</p><p>“I don’t see it,” she said, though she did not dismiss the idea out of hand. “I am a public servant, not a politician.”</p><p>Friends sometimes wonder why Commissioner Tisch works at all. Forbes magazine estimates her family’s fortune, which started with Loews Hotels and now includes insurance, natural gas pipelines and the New York Giants football team, at $10 billion. The family’s philanthropy includes the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, Tisch Hospital at NYU Langone Health, the Tisch Galleries at the Metropolitan Museum, the Tisch Children’s Zoo in Central Park and more.</p><p>But Commissioner Tisch, the daughter and granddaughter of two strong women, neither of whom came from money, learned hard work by example. Her mother, Merryl Tisch, is a former chancellor of the New York State Board of Regents. Her grandmother, Sylvia Hiat, who was for 30 years the principal at what was then the Hebrew school at the 14th Street Y, called her granddaughter every morning until her death this past summer. “She was my alarm clock,” Commissioner Tisch said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Commissioner Tisch, appointed and sworn in by Mayor Eric Adams, says she speaks to him daily. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Justin Lane/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>She was also her coach. Her grandmother was worried about her running the New York City Marathon, Commissioner Tisch said in a eulogy, recounting how her phone rang early in the race, just as she got over the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. Her grandmother had been tracking her progress on an iPad via a computer chip in Commissioner Tisch’s racing bib.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“If you’re going to do this,” her grandmother said, “you might as well speed it up a bit.”</p><p>Unlike her two younger brothers, Commissioner Tisch never wanted to enter the family business or finance. Instead, she developed what current and former colleagues call an exceptionally tough management style and poured her drive into nearly two decades working in law enforcement and technology and as sanitation commissioner. All are vital to the city, and a world away from the privileged comforts she grew up in.</p><p>“My career has been one of the great blessings of my life,” she said.</p><h2 id="link-274149ac">A Sometimes Abrasive Boss</h2><p>Commissioner Tisch took the chair at the head of the table in the conference room at 1 Police Plaza, the department’s 1973 Brutalist headquarters in Lower Manhattan. In an hourlong interview, she wore a turtleneck sweater, black boots and large diamond earrings. She was talkative and purposeful, but circumspect, particularly when discussing the mayor.</p><p>“We have regular, scheduled meetings,” she said. “But, you know, things come up all the time. So I would say it’s safe to say we either speak or exchange messages every day.”</p><p>As the mayor’s reputation has crashed and Commissioner Tisch’s profile has risen, she has been careful not to upstage him. She has profusely praised Mr. Adams in public and credited his leadership for falling crime rates. “He’s still the mayor,” said Ryan Merola, Commissioner Tisch’s chief of staff. “He still calls the shots.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The commissioner herself is not a natural public speaker, and no one has ever suggested she has a dazzling political charisma. In January, at her first State of the N.Y.P.D. speech, an annual address to the nonprofit New York City Police Foundation, she projected a technocratic competence as she read stiffly from a Teleprompter. She talked of a “hyperlocal, data-driven policing model” while a screen behind her displayed a blizzard of statistics.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police Headquarters is suffused with technology that Commissioner Tisch has pushed for years.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karsten Moran for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The conference room at 1 Police Plaza had the same sensibility. Its walls were lined with screens displaying video surveillance — Union Square, Times Square, traffic on the Verrazzano-Narrows — as well as real-time responses to emergency calls. In one corner were reports of an assault and a robbery, both listed as “in progress.”</p><p>The displays reflected some of Commissioner Tisch’s earlier successes. Over a dozen years in the department, she helped build an app that provided officers with real-time information about emergency calls directly on their iPhones, and ended decades of relying on radios or paper files at headquarters. She was also a leader in developing the Domain Awareness System, one of the world’s largest networks of security cameras and facial recognition software.</p><p>The cameras helped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/nyregion/uhc-ceo-suspect-photos-facial-recognition.html" title="">trace the steps of Luigi Mangione</a>, the man accused of killing the health care executive at a Manhattan hotel. The police ultimately apprehended him because a customer at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pa., recognized him from a photo. The cameras have helped fight crime, but they have also sparked fierce criticism from watchdog groups that New Yorkers are living in a surveillance state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The commissioner’s extraordinary wealth has prompted questions about how she can lead uniformed officers whose starting salary is $56,000. She says her track record speaks for itself. “I never thought of it as bridging any gap,” she said. “I see it more as a partnership based on mutual respect, different skills, different talents, different experiences.”</p><p>She is a fierce defender of the rank and file. “Some of the rhetoric in New York City that’s hurled at cops, for example, at protests, is quite vile and unacceptable,” she said. “God bless them for taking it as professionally as they have done.” She has been praised by uniformed officers for bringing a sense of order to the mayhem, although there is grumbling about reduced overtime hours and a disciplinary crackdown.</p><p>“She’s holding everybody accountable. It doesn’t matter what rank you are,” said Scott Munro, president of the detectives’ union. But he said discipline has been heavy-handed and has made attrition problems worse. “I’m losing detectives every day,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Commissioner Tisch, who comes from one of New York’s wealthiest families, says she has found common cause with officers who walk beats.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victoria Will for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Commissioner Tisch also brings a reputation as a sometimes abrasive boss, according to seven former and current employees who worked with her when she ran the Sanitation Department and was head of information technology under Mayor Bill de Blasio. The employees, who did not want to be identified for fear of retribution, said she belittled people publicly and shouted and even swore at workers who questioned her. One former manager left her position after Commissioner Tisch told her not to speak at meetings and then ostracized her.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Her defenders say she has an intensity that they like, and that she gets things done. “Have I ever seen her curse or yell at anybody? Of course I have,” Mr. Merola said. “People yell back. It will be a dynamic. It is not a pound-the-table-and-everyone-goes-silent.”</p><p>Joshua Goodman, who worked with Commissioner Tisch at the Sanitation Department, recalled one late night in 2022 when she was reading a draft of a speech he had written for her to give the next day.</p><p>Her critique: “This is a snoozefest. I know you can do better than this.”</p><p>Mr. Goodman went back to work. “She’s not, you know, rubbing your head and saying, ‘Great job,’” he said. At the same time, he said, “I worked with a lot of blunt guys” and “they don’t get talked about the same way.”</p><p>John Miller, a former deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism who worked with Commissioner Tisch, said he had little patience for stories about her management. “There’s a police department to run and lives are on the line,” he said. “Go out and fill out the hurt feelings report and leave it in the file. It’s called having a boss.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Commissioner Tisch has a management style that some subordinates call bruising, others invigorating.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hilary Swift for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Harry Nespoli, the longtime president of the sanitation workers’ union, described a different energy.</p><p>“The louder she got, the more quiet I got,” he said. “I told her once, ‘You want to see the scars on my back, Jess? I’ll show the scars on my back.’”</p><p>And yet, Mr. Nespoli said, she was the only commissioner who got him extra workers and trucks. “She’s not a slacker,” he said. “She’s a worker.”</p><p>Joseph Kenny, the chief of detectives, said he liked her directness. “When Police Commissioner Tisch asks you a question and you give an answer, you’d better be prepared for two more questions,” he said.</p><p>Accounts of her bruising style are not news to Commissioner Tisch. “I expect if you’re coming to a meeting with me that you’re prepared,” she said. “And I expect that you bring passionate intensity to your work. Generally those types of people enjoy working with and for me. Others, maybe not so much.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>But she was sensitive to the talk. “I hope you’ve heard from people,” she said, laughing tentatively, “who tell you how much they love working for me.”</p><h2 id="link-478f85b8">A Childhood Illness</h2><p>Family friends remember Commissioner Tisch as a classic eldest child, a take-charge sister to two younger brothers. She grew up on the Upper East Side, went to the elite private Dalton School, and spent weekends at the family house in Westchester County. But an otherwise charmed life was marked by arthritis, diagnosed when she was 18 months old. The disease continued well into her teens, caused stiff and inflamed joints and left permanent damage.</p><p>“I’ve never been able to turn my head,” Commissioner Tisch said. “It doesn’t bother me at all. Just turn my body or my chair.” It was an issue, however, on the crew team.</p><p>“One of the things that you’re supposed to do as coxswain is tell the rowers where they are vis-à-vis the other boat,” Commissioner Tisch said. “And the only way to get a really good sense of it is if you turn your head 90 degrees, because otherwise it’s distorted. And so I had a whole mirror situation set up on certain boats to help me figure out where we were.”</p><p>The Harvard team won a national championship in 2003 in Camden, N.J., where the rowers celebrated by throwing Commissioner Tisch into the water, the tradition for coxswains after major victories.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p>From there she blazed forward to earn degrees in both law and business. In 2006 she married a fellow student, Daniel Levine, now the managing partner of a venture capital firm. The couple has two sons, 9 and 13.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The commissioner has sons who are 9 and 13, and is married to a Harvard classmate.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Justin Lane/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>By 2008, with both degrees complete, Commissioner Tisch found herself at an uncharacteristic loss.</p><p>She had landed coveted summer internships, including at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, a top mergers and acquisitions firm; as a fact-checker in the speechwriting office of George W. Bush’s White House; on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal; and at The New York Post. None appealed as a permanent path.</p><p>By that August, she had passed the New York bar exam and was looking for work just as the financial crisis hit. “The world was ending,” she said. A friend suggested she try the New York police, where there was an analyst position available in what was then the counterterrorism bureau.</p><p>Ray Kelly, then the commissioner, did not normally meet with applicants for such entry-level jobs, but he ended up interviewing her. “Probably because she was a Tisch,” he said, adding that he had been impressed with her three Harvard degrees.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Thus began what turned out to be a defining period of her career. The city was still on high alert seven years after 9/11 and Commissioner Tisch was part of an elite team aimed at thwarting attacks. Other ambitious Ivy Leaguers were signing up, including at one point four women from Harvard.</p><p>“The vibe was very start-up,” said Rebecca Weiner, then an intelligence analyst and now deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Commissioner Tisch’s work included, among other things, “radiation detection and how to develop protective overlays” for events, she said. “It was very intense.”</p><p>It was at this point that Commissioner Tisch worked on the Domain Awareness System, including handling contracts to build and expand it. Mr. Kelly heard about how she would confront dawdling contractors. She had a reputation, he said admiringly, of “keeping them in line. She was very businesslike and took no guff.”</p><p>She continued to work on the system under William J. Bratton, who replaced Mr. Kelly. In late 2019 she became the city’s first information technology commissioner under Mr. de Blasio, and within months she was in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, struggling to create a contact tracing system and then a vaccine distribution system. She received accolades for managing both, along with familiar complaints about her style.</p><p>“She had that kind of doggedness about her that sometimes rubbed some folks from the bureaucracy the wrong way,” said Emma Wolfe, then deputy mayor for administration under Mr. de Blasio. “If some kind of midlevel person in the bureaucracy said, ‘This is not the way it’s done,’ that just had no bearing for her.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-33"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>As sanitation commissioner, Jessica Tisch found nemeses in rats and snow.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lucia Vazquez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>By 2022 Mr. Adams gave her the job of sanitation commissioner. She has said, earnestly, that she had always dreamed of it.</p><p>She worked to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/02/upshot/nyc-trash-rules.html" title="">get black plastic garbage bags off the streets</a> and replace them with containers, a standard in most other cities but a revolution in New York. In her announcement of the program, one line went viral, written by Mr. Goodman to punch up the snoozefest speech: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-9j3_Xvgf4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The rats don’t run this city, we do</a>.”</p><p>Colleagues still remember her office at the Sanitation Department — a white desk, white furniture, white walls.</p><p>“My homes look the same way,” she said. “I like to clean up messes.”</p><h2 id="link-7177c2e7">Another Bloomberg?</h2><p>One of her most immediate goals has been straightening out the Police Department, which was plagued by a federal investigation that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/nyregion/nypd-commissioner-caban-adams.html" title="">drove out a previous commissioner</a>, another inquiry that overshadowed the short tenure of her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/nyregion/nypd-thomas-donlon-search.html" title="">immediate predecessor</a> and a widespread sense of disorder and meddling by Mr. Adams.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>She is pushing to create <a href="https://www.ourtownny.com/news/commish-tisch-unveils-new-quality-of-life-patrols-AA4165561" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“quality of life” teams</a> to go after low-level crimes like aggressive panhandling, illegal street vending and public urination. Officers, she has said, will no longer ignore subway riders who smoke, drink or take up extra seats.</p><p>She insists the efforts are not part of a dragnet or “zero-tolerance policing,” but to some New Yorkers the teams are reminiscent of street crime units championed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in the 1990s that harassed Black and Latino men. Critics see it as an embrace of the “broken windows” theory of policing, which holds that the best way to prevent major crimes is to enforce laws against petty ones.</p><p>“The quality of life teams sound like they’re really going to be a problem,” said Anthony Buissereth, who helps lead an anti-violence group in Brooklyn. He heard Commissioner Tisch speak about the teams in February and said parts of her presentation were “draconian.”</p><p>Others commend her efforts to make the police more accountable, particularly after a recent predecessor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/nyregion/how-the-nypd-quietly-shuts-down-discipline-cases-against-officers.html" title="">shut down more than 50 serious discipline cases</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-37"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Commissioner Tisch, her most fervent fans say, could one day be the mayor of New York City.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victoria Will for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>“I have a huge amount of respect for her,&#34; said Jonathan Darche, executive director of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the independent oversight agency that investigates police misconduct.
