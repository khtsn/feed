Trump appoints a successor, the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20250106a.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fed said on Monday</a>.</p><p>Mr. Barr will continue to serve on the central bank’s Board of Governors. But his decision to leave his role as vice chair of supervision may have been intended to sidestep a legal battle with Mr. Trump. Some individuals attached to the Trump administration wanted to remove Mr. Barr before his term as vice chair expired, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on background because of the sensitivity of the issue.</p><p>That could have resulted in a protracted — and costly — legal fight over whether an incoming president has the authority to remove someone from a Senate-confirmed position at an independent agency.</p><p>Mr. Barr nodded at the potential for tension with the new administration in a statement on Monday.</p><p>“The risk of a dispute over the position could be a distraction from our mission. In the current environment, I’ve determined that I would be more effective in serving the American people from my role as governor,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But some financial regulatory experts questioned why Mr. Barr — and the Fed itself — would allow a political change to influence who served in a powerful role. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed’s chair, has made a point of saying that the Fed is independent of the White House and that its decisions are not influenced by politics. Mr. Powell has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/jerome-powell-trump-fed.html" title="">also insisted that Mr. Trump lacks the legal authority</a> to fire him from his role as Fed chair, which is also confirmed by the Senate.</p><p>“I’m surprised by Barr’s announcement, because I expected him to resist Republican calls for his ouster and make a point of defending the Fed’s independence,” Ian Katz, managing director at Capital Alpha, said in an email.</p><p>His departure will also effectively freeze any bank regulatory actions until Mr. Trump names someone to the vice chairman role. In announcing his decision, the central bank said: “The Board does not intend to take up any major rulemakings until a vice chair for supervision successor is confirmed.”</p><p>“The Fed historically, zealously guards its independence,” Aaron Klein, the Miriam K. Carliner chair and senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. “I find it strange that the Fed would not only tacitly seem to support this decision by Barr, but go further and announce a moratorium on rule making.”</p><p>Mr. Klein noted that if Mr. Trump opted not to pick anyone for a year or more, it could effectively chill bank rule making indefinitely.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Dennis Kelleher, the president, chief executive and co-founder of Better Markets, a nonprofit that pushes for tougher financial regulation, called Mr. Barr’s decision “shocking” and said it would hinder the Fed’s role in overseeing the safety and soundness of the financial system.</p><p>“His baseless capitulation to deregulation zealots will, in fact, destroy that mission quicker and more thoroughly than any dispute over the position,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Barr’s move comes after a tumultuous tenure overseeing regulation and supervision of the nation’s largest banks. Mr. Barr oversaw an attempt to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/10/business/economy/michael-barr-banking-regulations-fed.html" title="">rewrite financial rules</a> that would have increased the amount of easy-access money that banks must have at the ready.</p><p>The overhaul would have required the largest banks to increase their cushion of capital — cash and other readily available assets that could be used to absorb losses in times of trouble — which Mr. Barr said would ensure banks could withstand periods of severe turmoil.</p><p>The proposal — and Mr. Barr — immediately came under attack from a wide variety of groups, including the banking industry, lawmakers and even some of his colleagues at the Fed. Two of the Fed’s seven governors, both Trump appointees, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardvotes.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">voted against</a> the rules.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Barr <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/business/banks-basel-capital.html" title="">ultimately watered down the proposal</a> after acknowledging the blowback.</p><p>“Life gives you ample opportunity to learn and relearn the lesson of humility,” Mr. Barr said at an event in September.</p><p>While Mr. Trump has not announced any plans to try to replace Mr. Barr, the president-elect has made clear he plans to take an industry-friendly stance toward banks, echoing his administration’s approach during his first term. Mr. Trump’s vice chair of supervision, Randal K. Quarles, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/business/economy/bank-regulations-fed.html" title="">worked to loosen bank supervision</a> during his tenure.</p><p>Even before Mr. Barr announced his decision to leave, there was widespread speculation that the bank proposal, known as Basel III endgame, would not gain final approval in a Trump administration.</p><p>The changes must be jointly agreed upon by the Fed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Mr. Trump has the opportunity to nominate the directors of the F.D.I.C. and O.C.C., though he has not yet said whom he plans to name.</p><p>Senator Tim Scott, the South Carolina Republican who will head the powerful Senate Banking Committee, welcomed Mr. Barr’s decision to step down, citing the blowup of Silicon Valley Bank and other regional firms in the spring of 2023 as well as the Basel III rules.</p><p>“From his supervisory failures during the spring 2023 bank failures to the disastrous Basel III endgame proposal — Michael Barr has failed to meet the responsibilities of his position,” Mr. Scott said in a statement. “I stand ready to work with President Trump to ensure we have responsible financial regulators at the helm.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
