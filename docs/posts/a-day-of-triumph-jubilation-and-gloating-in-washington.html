Temperatures and winds were so brutal that the swearing-in and Inaugural Address were moved inside.</p><p>But women still teetered on icy sidewalks in bare legs and stiletto heels on the way to packed hotel ballrooms. National Guardsmen manned streets blocked off with metal fencing and concrete barricades. The oligarchs assembled for a billionaires’ ball.</p><p>And “Y.M.C.A.,” one of Mr. Trump’s favorite songs, blared day and night from pedicabs.</p><p>Here are some pages from a reporter’s notebook.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-61d7135f">Happy Canadians, for a While</h2><p>The Canadians were elated. At a well-heated rooftop party on Monday morning at their embassy on Pennsylvania Avenue, word was out that Mr. Trump would not slap 25 percent tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico as he had threatened — at least on Day 1.</p><p>“There’s relief,” said Andrew Furey, the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, who was in town for the inaugural. And yet, there were those Proud Boys outside, trolling the embassy about Mr. Trump’s pay-attention-to-me call to make Canada America’s newest state.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
