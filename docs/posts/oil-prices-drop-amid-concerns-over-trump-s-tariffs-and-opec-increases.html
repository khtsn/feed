    <h1>Oil Prices Drop Amid Concerns Over Trump’s Tariffs and OPEC Increases</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a possible hint of weakening demand, crude oil inventories in the United States rose by a hefty 3.6 million barrels — much more than analysts expected — in the last week of February, according to the Energy Information Administration. Still, these stocks, which are closely watched by the markets, are 4 percent below their five-year averages.</p><p>Several conflicting trends are influencing oil prices. Oil consumption is highly sensitive to the performance of the world economy, which might slow if the trade war heats up, crimping trade, air travel and other activities.</p><p>At the same time, several members of OPEC Plus, including the United Arab Emirates and Iraq, want to increase production, partly to fulfill agreements with international investors. The group also includes Saudi Arabia and Russia.</p><p>The oil-producing countries have ensnared themselves in a complex series of agreements, which analysts say the markets struggle to interpret. But traders fear that the millions of barrels a day of oil currently being held off the market could eventually come back at a time when world oil consumption is growing only modestly.</p><p>In addition, it is hard to gauge what impact the Trump administration’s energy strategy will have on the oil markets. Tighter sanctions on producers like Iran and Venezuela would reduce supplies. But easing regulation of the petroleum industry in the United States might increase oil production. And removing restrictions on Russian energy as part of an effort to achieve a cease-fire in the war in Ukraine could also add to the global supply.</p></div></div>
