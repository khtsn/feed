The usual NBC correspondents who pop up on MSNBC’s air with updates on, say, the latest fight in Congress, will no longer be available.</p><p>One option would be to convert MSNBC’s lineup to progressive talk shows, but the channel’s president, Rebecca Kutler, is leaning in a different direction. On Thursday, Ms. Kutler was set to announce the channel’s first-ever Washington bureau chief: not a left-leaning partisan, but a down-the-middle print reporter with long stints at Politico and The Wall Street Journal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Her choice, <a href="https://nationalpress.org/speaker/sudeep-reddy/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sudeep Reddy</a>, was most recently a senior managing editor at Politico, and his résumé is heavy with economics and Washington policy coverage. </p><p>“The MSNBC audience is cerebral and appreciates analytical, contextual reporting,” she said in an interview. “He is going to build and run a significant Washington reporting team, that to me matches with the moment — a serious moment — where real reporting will matter.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sudeep Reddy, formerly a managing editor at Politico, at the Brookings Institution in Washington in 2019.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Brochstein/SOPA Images/LightRocket, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>MSNBC has never had a separate Washington bureau. Ms. Kutler has announced plans to hire <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/msnbc-scott-matthews-newsgathering-hire-100-journalists-1236329209/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 100 journalists</a> for the new go-it-alone version of the channel, including new on-air correspondents to cover Capitol Hill, the State and Justice Departments and the Supreme Court — roles that were previously filled by NBC News-affiliated reporters.</p><p>At a time of contraction in the news business, it is an unusual expansion and something of a gamble. Straight-ahead TV reporting rarely attracts bigger ratings than the partisan commentary that has come to dominate much of 24-hour cable news. Ms. Maddow, for instance, remains MSNBC’s highest-rated host. Many liberal viewers also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/business/media/msnbc-fox-news-ratings-election.html" title="">abandoned</a> MSNBC in the aftermath of President Trump’s re-election, although its ratings have crept back up since the inauguration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>MSNBC and NBC News have long had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/business/media/nbc-msnbc-trump-biden.html" title="">an awkward relationship</a>, dating back to the cable channel’s origins in 1996. The staff at NBC News often looked down on its upstart sibling. After MSNBC underwent a ratings boom in the Trump era, some NBC News journalists worried how the profitable partisanship on cable was coloring their efforts to present neutral reporting to a mass audience.</p><p>Mr. Reddy, 45, is expected to start his role in June. He will report to Scott Matthews, a former executive at CNBC and WABC-TV in New York that Ms. Kutler selected to oversee her channel’s news gathering operations.</p><p>Ms. Kutler, who was named the channel’s president in February, has made other programming changes. Joy Reid’s 7 p.m. weeknight show was canceled. Jen Psaki, who served as press secretary to former President Biden, took on a 9 p.m. show that airs between Tuesdays and Fridays.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael M.
