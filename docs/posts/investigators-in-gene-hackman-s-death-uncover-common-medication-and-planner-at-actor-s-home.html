He added that both bodies tested negative for carbon monoxide.</p><p>Investigators combing through the secluded home outside of Santa Fe, N.M., discovered common medication, medical records and a 2025 planner, according to a search warrant return released on Friday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The return, an inventory of items taken during a search of the home, specified that police officers had recovered thyroid medication, Tylenol and diltiazem, a drug often used to treat high blood pressure or chest pain.</p><p>It was not clear whether the medications listed were the pills that investigators had described as being scattered near Ms. Arakawa’s body. The sheriff did not give any more details of what was in the monthly planner.</p><p>Officers also found records from MyQuest, an online medical portal where patients can review test results and make doctor’s appointments. Officers also recovered two green cellphones.</p><p>It could be months before clearer answers emerge about how the couple died. The unusual circumstances of their deaths have rocked Hollywood, as well as the cultural hub of Santa Fe and film lovers across the globe.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The unusual circumstances of their deaths have rocked Hollywood, as well as the cultural hub of Santa Fe and film lovers across the globe.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adria Malcolm for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Sheriff Mendoza said at the news conference that it could take three months or longer to get toxicology results that could clarify the cause of their deaths.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Hackman’s body was found on Wednesday in the mud room of his home, and the body of Ms. Arakawa was found in a bathroom near an open prescription bottle and scattered pills. One of the couple’s dogs, a German shepherd, was found dead in a nearby closet. Two other dogs were found alive on the property.</p><p>Sheriff Mendoza previously said that Mr. Hackman and Ms. Arakawa had been dead for “several days, possibly even up to a couple weeks,” based on the condition of their bodies.</p><p>The drugs that were found at the house are used to treat common ailments. Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker, which lowers blood pressure and can help with abnormal heart rhythms. Thyroid medicine is used to treat low levels of thyroid hormone, a condition that can result in exhaustion, weight gain and depression, among other symptoms.</p><p>Dr. Garret FitzGerald, the director of the Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics at the University of Pennsylvania, said all of these drugs had the potential to be fatal in large doses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In very high doses, Tylenol can cause liver failure, thyroid pills can cause arrhythmia, and calcium channel blockers can cause cardiogenic shock. But, Dr. FitzGerald added, “all of these would be very rare causes of death and would require very high doses and likely some prior susceptibility of the individual.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Hackman with Ms. Arakawa at the Golden Globe Awards in Beverly Hills, Calif., in 2003.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark J.
