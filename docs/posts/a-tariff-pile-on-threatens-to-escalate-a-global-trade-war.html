This time, no U.S. trading partner was spared.</p><p>The new tariffs amped up the risk of a global trade war. The European Union on Wednesday vowed to roll out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/world/europe/eu-us-trump-tariffs.html?smid=url-share" title="">$28 billion in retaliatory levies</a> next month on American products, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/12/eu-retaliates-against-trump-tariffs-with-26bn-countermeasures" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bourbon, jeans and agricultural products</a>.</p><p>“Jobs are at stake, prices up, nobody needs that,” said Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission. Jonathan Reynolds, Britain’s trade secretary, said his country would “keep all options on the table.”</p><p><strong>European officials hope they can still strike a deal.</strong> But President Trump seems determined to stick with his protectionist policies despite the stock market turmoil that he’s unleashed and regardless of the pushback from business leaders and global allies. “The tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country,” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-meets-corporate-america-economic-fears-nip-stocks-2025-03-11/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump told corporate chiefs</a> on Tuesday at a Business Roundtable event in Washington.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>They “may go up higher,” Trump added, underscoring that he views tariffs as a way to revive America’s manufacturing sector.</p><p><strong>The markets are quiet.</strong> Stocks in Europe and Asia are mostly up and U.S. futures are a tick higher. That’s after tariff jitters briefly pushed the S&amp;P 500 into correction territory on Tuesday — the sell-off has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/investors-flee-equities-trump-driven-uncertainty-sparks-economic-worry-2025-03-10/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wiped roughly $4 trillion off</a> the benchmark index in less than a month — as concerns grow that the levies will push up prices and slow growth.</p><p><strong>Investors are also bracing for new inflation data.</strong> The Consumer Price Index is due out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. A hot reading, plus the uncertainty around the tariff’s inflationary effects, could prompt the Fed to keep interest rates higher for longer.</p><p>In 2018, Trump imposed metals tariffs that ultimately bolstered domestic steel and aluminum makers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/politics/trumps-tariffs-on-steel-and-aluminum-go-into-effect.html" title="">but raised costs and lowered production drastically</a> for the automobile, tool and industrial machinery sectors. Analysts see a similar dynamic playing out with this round — Goldman Sachs economists this week <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-slashes-us-economic-forecasts-as-tariff-impacts-grow-considerably-more-adverse-170805099.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lowered their full-year U.S. G.D.P. forecast</a> and predicted even higher inflation.</p><p><strong>Who will pay for the tariffs? </strong>Walmart has tried to get Chinese suppliers to bear some of the costs from Trump’s tariffs, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-06/walmart-asks-chinese-suppliers-for-major-price-cuts-on-trump-tariffs?sref=0w5HLLb3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Bloomberg</a> — a negotiating tactic that’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-12/china-summons-walmart-after-report-of-price-cut-demand?sref=0w5HLLb3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drawn the attention of the authorities in Beijing</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>Trump told C.E.O.s that he wasn’t backing down.</strong> More levies, including reciprocal tariffs, are expected to go into effect next month that could further jolt global trade. The potential upheaval has rattled corporate chiefs — and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-economy-comments-tariffs-recession-team-reaction-f5c24248" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">even some of Trump’s allies and aides</a> — who’ve been thrown off guard by the president’s on-again-off-again approach, The Wall Street Journal reports.</p><p>That has prompted a flood of concerned calls to Trump officials and some critical comments from C.E.O.s. “Swinging from one extreme to another is not the right policy approach,” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/ceraweek-chevron-ceo-says-extreme-energy-policy-swings-wrong-approach-2025-03-10/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mike Wirth</a>, Chevron’s C.E.O., said this week.</p><h3 id="link-594cd70c"><span>HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING </span></h3><p><strong>President Trump may name Michelle Bowman as the Fed’s top bank cop.</strong> Bowman, a Fed governor, is seen as the front-runner for the vice chair of banking supervision, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/bowman-seen-as-frontrunner-as-feds-top-banking-cop-422b2d0b?mod=hp_lead_pos3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to The Wall Street Journal</a>, a position that carries significant oversight responsibilities. Separately, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-11/fed-staff-met-with-treasury-s-doge-team-in-january-filing-shows" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fed staff cooperated</a> with a Department of Government Efficiency request for access to federal payment systems, Bloomberg reported; the meetings came before Jay Powell told Congress that the central bank had had “no contact” with Elon Musk’s cost-cutting team.</p><p><strong>Musk wants to support President Trump with another $100 million.</strong> The billionaire, who spent more than $250 million to help elect Trump, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-donation.html" title="">considering donating the extra money</a> to help further the president’s agenda, according to The Times. The move would likely bring Musk even closer to Trump and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/10/trump-maga-inc-power-fundraising?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">add to the president’s political coffers</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>The House passes a key spending bill.</strong> The measure, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/house-stopgap-funding-bill-vote-government-shutdown.html" title="">passed largely along party lines</a>, would fund the government through Sept. 30 and avert a shutdown at the end of the week. The bill, which raises military spending by $6 billion but slightly decreases overall spending, heads to the Senate, where Democrats face a dilemma over whether to support it.</p><h2 id="link-1288df4f">Big Oil has a new catchphrase </h2><p>At the CERAWeek gathering of oil executives in Houston this week, talk of climate change and clean energy has been replaced with the buzz words “energy realism.”</p><p><strong>It’s another way of saying, “Drill, baby, drill,”</strong> President Trump’s rallying cry that doubles as an energy policy. While spending on clean energy reached $280 billion in 2023 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/climate/trump-clean-energy-transition.html" title="">under the Biden administration</a>, Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/climate/trump-us-climate-policy-changes.html" title="">gutted many of the programs</a> that encouraged such investments — <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/big-oil-urges-trump-not-to-gut-bidens-climate-law-795dc597" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">despite efforts by some oil executives</a> to persuade Trump to preserve them.</p><p>“Beyond the obvious scale and cost problems, there is simply no physical way wind, solar and batteries could replace the myriad uses of natural gas,” Chris Wright, the energy secretary, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/climate/energy-secretary-climate-change-fossil-fuels.html" title="">said at the meeting</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The green retreat carries big questions, especially as low energy prices dent oil company profits and as the United States faces a power crunch to support its A.I. ambitions. In the next three years, data centers could triple their energy use, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/climate/artificial-intelligence-power-emissions.html#:~:text=In%20the%20next%20three%20years,nation&#39;s%20electricity%20consumption%20by%202028." title="">according to the Department of Energy</a>.</p><p><strong>Executives seem to be going with it, though. </strong>“Across the board, we have to think about power and energy in a pragmatic way,” Larry Fink, the BlackRock C.E.O. who has previously championed E.S.G. — environmental, social and governance — investing, said onstage.</p><p><strong>Can the shift stop the clean energy transition?</strong> Not entirely, though the Trump policy changes are already dragging it down, analysts note.</p><p>One big reason: Market forces have pushed down costs.<strong> </strong>Biden era policies may be in jeopardy, but “the economics have never been better,” Jon Creyts, chief executive of RMI, a nonprofit that promotes sustainability, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/climate/trump-clean-energy-transition.html" title="">told The Times</a> this month.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-789e3a59">How Anthropic is keeping the wheel </h2><p>Of Google’s many investments in artificial intelligence, one of the most closely watched is in Anthropic, the company founded by defectors from OpenAI.</p><p>The Times’s Cade Metz, Nico Grant and David McCabe revealed on Tuesday the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/technology/google-investment-anthropic.html" title="">details of that investment</a>, which allows Anthropic to chart its own course despite having received billions of dollars from Google.</p><p><strong>The terms: </strong>Google has invested $3 billion in Anthropic for a 14 percent stake. That’s close to the limit of Google’s potential ownership in the start-up, filings show — even as it is set to invest an additional $750 million through a convertible debt offering in September. Google also holds no voting rights and no board seats, or even observer rights.</p><p>The details emerged from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/google-antitrust-ruling.html" title="">Google’s antitrust fight</a> with the Justice Department, after The Times obtained documents filed by Anthropic that detailed the tech giant’s investment. Under President Trump, the department is no longer seeking to force Google to sell its stakes in A.I. companies; it has only asked to be notified before Google makes new investments.</p><p><strong>Anthropic is very different from OpenAI, and may present a model for other A.I. start-ups.</strong> OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, then created a for-profit arm to raise money from outsiders. Until recently, it relied almost entirely on one investor, Microsoft, for funding. That arrangement is beginning to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/technology/microsoft-openai-partnership-deal.html" title="">lead to problems</a>. (OpenAI is now trying to convert itself into a public benefit corporation, a type of for-profit entity that aims to create products for the public good.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Anthropic, on the other hand, was set up from the beginning as a public benefit corporation and has raised money from different investors.</p><p><strong>But it’s a reminder that even buzzy A.I. start-ups need Big Tech. </strong>Anthropic has raised billions in funding. Much of that comes from Google and from Amazon, which has kicked in $8 billion.</p><p>The astounding sums are required because of a longstanding tenet of Silicon Valley (at least until the emergence of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/technology/what-is-deepseek-china-ai.html" title="">the low-cost Chinese start-up DeepSeek</a>): Developing and powering A.I. products requires a lot of computational power, something tech giants have. Google and Amazon provide Anthropic with much of that computing power, while OpenAI gets a lot of its requirements from Microsoft.</p><p>So, as much as Anthropic and OpenAI may want to limit the power that tech giants have on them, they will also depend on Big Tech for a while.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump with details about Tesla vehicles.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-646acb50">Picture of the day</h2><p><em>— President Trump held a sheet featuring Tesla prices and other sales points at a White House event on Tuesday during which he said that he was </em><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/11/business/tesla-stock-trump-white-house/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>buying two of the company’s cars</em></a><em> and that he would designate violence against Tesla dealerships as domestic terrorism.
