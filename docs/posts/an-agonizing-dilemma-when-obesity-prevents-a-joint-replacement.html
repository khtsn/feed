She is in constant pain from hip arthritis and uses a walker and a wheelchair.</p><p>The problem is her obesity — her body mass index, or B.M.I., is over 50. And for someone like Ms. Kline, 54, of Reading, Pa., finding a doctor who is willing to give her a joint replacement that may ease the pain can be a near-impossible task.</p><p>Dilemmas like hers are roiling orthopedic medicine as obesity levels soar, and with them arthritis. What should orthopedists do when confronted with patients whose B.M.I. is very high?</p><p>While the science of body mass index <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/15/well/live/bmi-health-weight-ama.html" title="">is frequently criticized</a>, doctors say the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26842406/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">risks</a> of operating on patients with B.M.I.s that fall in the upper ranges of obesity can be dire, including infections deep in the prosthetic joint that can lead to amputations and even death. And the risks <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27612609/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">escalate</a> as a patient’s B.M.I. increases.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Professional organizations —- the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons and the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons — do not have firm B.M.I. cutoffs for operations, but orthopedists have their own.</p><p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37595767/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">L</a>ess than half of orthopedic surgeons in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37595767/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a survey published last year</a> said they would operate on a patient with a B.M.I. over 40 — more than <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db360.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">22 million</a> American adults fell into that category in 2017-18. Only 11 percent would operate on one of the 3.9 million Americans with a B.M.I. over 50. And patients with a B.M.I. over 55 would be rejected almost everywhere. Just 3 percent of U.S. orthopedists would operate.</p><p>And even if a doctor is willing to operate, insurers often refuse to pay. Hospitals also may turn away these patients, who tend to need longer stays and more care and are considered money-losers.</p><p>The result, said Dr. Nathanael Heckmann of the University of Southern California, is that “whole populations are being denied orthopedic care.”</p><p>Patients suspect the stigma of obesity plays a role.</p><p>“It’s just a blanket, ‘You weigh too much, therefore, you don’t get this,’” said Lynn Rubinett, 66, of Austin, Texas, who says she fought for more than a year before she could get a hip replacement. Her B.M.I. was 43.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The new obesity drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound might help some, but they would be insufficient for many. For example, a woman who is 5 feet 5 inches tall and has a B.M.I. of 50 would have to lose 20 percent of her weight to get to a B.M.I. of 40 — something few can do, even with the new drugs.</p><p>At issue is an ethical quandary: Is it really OK to replace the joints of patients who are severely obese? And who should make that decision?</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Yale Fillingham of the Rothman Orthopaedic Institute in Philadelphia, holding a model pelvis.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hannah Beier for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><hr/><p>Patients say doctors often hold the outdated assumption that, if patients really, really tried, they could lose weight.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>One surgeon quipped to Ms. Rubinett that “people gain weight back after their hip replacement because they can get up and walk to the fridge again.’”</p><p>That joke, added Ms. Rubinett, reveals “a deep lack of compassion or understanding about how truly complex and difficult it is to sustainably shrink a body that carries 50 to 100 or more extra pounds.”</p><p>But doctors say there is a real struggle to balance patients’ needs with their commitment to medical ethics.</p><p>That includes Dr. Yale Fillingham of the Rothman Orthopaedic Institute in Philadelphia, who is developing updated guidelines for the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons.</p><p>“It’s a difficult topic,” he said. “There are a lot of nuances and different viewpoints that go into saying a B.M.I. cutoff is a good thing or a bad thing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Surgeons say they realize that the presence or absence of other chronic diseases, like diabetes, can affect risk. But, they note, B.M.I. is an independent risk factor, so they use it, and they say they are acutely aware of the risks of operating on people who are very heavy.</p><p>“When you look at the survivorship of someone who has an infection and how morbid and deadly the infection is, a lot of surgeons would rather tell the patient, ‘I’m sorry, I can’t help you,’ than feel responsible for devastating outcomes,” Dr. Fillingham said.</p><p>Dr. Charles P. Hannon, an orthopedic surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., does not have a strict B.M.I. cutoff, but says patients with high B.M.I.s have to understand what they may be facing. The risk of an infection may be 10 percent or less, “but if it happens to you, it is 100 percent,” he said.</p><p>Dr. Hannon said a patient recently came to him after another doctor replaced his hip. The man’s wound did not heal, and he developed an infection deep within his joint.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“We are trying to save his leg,” Dr. Hannon said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Fillingham. “There are a lot of nuances and different viewpoints that go into saying a B.M.I. cutoff is a good thing or a bad thing,” he said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hannah Beier for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><hr/><p>For Ms. Kline, nothing — not even death, she says — can be worse than the life she is living.</p><p>Her problems began in 2012, when she was 42 and her left hip began hurting so badly she couldn’t sleep. Her doctor’s diagnosis: osteoarthritis. His prescription: Lose weight.</p><p>Soon, she couldn’t walk. She had been swimming since 2006, but one day early in 2021, she was in too much pain for that.</p><p>Shortly after that awful day, Ms. Kline went to a local orthopedist in private practice.</p><p>To her surprise, she said, he never mentioned her weight. Instead, he offered to replace both hips, starting with the left one.</p><p>He operated in April 2021. Her B.M.I. was 45. A day later, she was discharged from the hospital, but her incision leaked for 20 weeks and her left hip hurt so much she couldn’t walk.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>She went to the Rothman Institute for a second opinion and saw Dr. Fillingham.</p><p>That pain? It was from a deep infection. He had to remove her prosthetic hip and put in a temporary implant while her infection cleared. She was in the hospital for a month and took intravenous antibiotics for 55 days.</p><p>Three months later, Dr. Fillingham gave her a new left hip. She was hospitalized for four days with no complications.</p><p>But her right hip hurt so much that she could not walk. Her BMI shot up to 50.</p><p>Dr. Fillingham was unable to help. His orthopedic practice allows joint replacement for a patient who had an infection after an earlier procedure. But it will not allow primary joint replacement for patients with a B.M.I. over 50. Ms. Kline’s is now 59.</p><hr/><p>Fran Ryan of Reno, Nev., was ready to give up on finding a doctor who would give her a new hip. With a B.M.I. of 41, she was told by surgeons she was simply too fat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“I was in my early 50s, and I couldn’t walk,” she said. “I have three kids — we walk and we hike.”</p><p>But she couldn’t do that anymore. She got a handicapped sticker for her car after a physiatrist told her that even walking the length of Costco was “too much walking.” And she knew it was — that short walk left her in intense pain.</p><p>Finally, she found a surgeon, Dr. Derek Amanatullah, at Stanford University — a four-hour drive from her home — who agreed to operate.</p><p>“He made me feel like a person,” she said. “Other doctors take that away — it doesn’t matter if you are in pain because you’re fat.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The only doctor Fran Ryan of Reno, Nev., could find who would finally replace her hip was a four hour drive away.

She had no complications.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Her son was married on Sept. 16.</p><p>“All I wanted to do was to be able to dance with him at his wedding,” Ms. Ryan said. She did, even though, she said, “I had to use my cane.</p><p>“My life is so dramatically improved,” she added, though she is not completely back to normal. “I lost so much muscle tone from not being able to walk,” she explained.</p><p>“But,” she said, “I had to be tenacious to keep looking for options after hitting brick walls.</p><p>“It is not lost on me that not everyone has those resources,” Ms. Ryan said.</p><hr/><p>For those with higher B.M.I.s, the search for help can be fruitless.</p><p>Janet Daniels, 56, of Alexandria, Va., has had obesity since she was eight. And no diet or exercise program has helped control her weight. Her B.M.I. is 61.3. Over and over, she was told no one would operate on her.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>She recently tried a new orthopedist, the fifth so far. When he saw her X-rays, he exclaimed that she was “bone on bone in both knees.”</p><p>But he, too, refused to do the surgery.</p><p>She shot back, “you’re the umpteenth orthopedist who has told me, ‘You’re fat. You have to suffer.’”</p><p>On her way out, he handed her the card of a nutritionist.</p><hr/><p>Ms. Kline finally found a doctor willing to replace her right hip, but he wants her to lose 30 pounds.</p><p>“He would not even schedule a follow-up appointment with me,” Ms. Kline said. “He told me to call back when I lost the 30 pounds.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>She has been trying since April and has been taking Wegovy for a month. But, so far, she hasn’t lost enough weight.</p><p>“I can’t live like this,” Ms. Kline said.</p><p>Dr. Heckmann understands. Though he has not treated Ms. Kline, he sees patients with very high B.M.I.s on a regular basis. And he sometimes says yes. But he would refuse a patient like her.</p><p>Someone who had an infection in one hip is much more likely to have another infection if he replaces the other hip. And congestive heart failure makes the surgery even more risky. He’s afraid an operation might kill her.</p><p>“I have a moral obligation to do no harm,” Dr. Heckmann said. “It goes against my moral fiber to do something that is prohibitively high risk.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Gina Kolata reports on diseases and treatments, how treatments are discovered and tested, and how they affect people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gina-kolata">More about Gina Kolata</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
