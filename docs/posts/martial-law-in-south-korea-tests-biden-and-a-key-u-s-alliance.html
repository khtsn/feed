And in 2023, he hosted President Yoon Suk Yeol for a state dinner at the White House, where the tuxedo-clad Mr. Yoon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000008877445/yoon-suk-yeol-american-pie-biden.html" title="">sang “American Pie”</a> to an adoring audience. Mr. Biden has also relied on Mr. Yoon to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/14/world/asia/north-south-korea-ukraine.html" title="">provide munitions</a> for Ukraine’s defense against the Russian invasion.</p><p>Now, with Mr. Yoon having imposed martial law after wildly accusing the opposition party of conspiring with North Korea to undermine him, the American relationship with South Korea could face its biggest test in decades.</p><p>And Mr. Biden, who has used <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/24/us/politics/biden-trump-foreign-policy.html" title="">democracy versus autocracy</a> as a defining framework of his foreign policy, will have to make hard choices on how to handle the crisis, after years of cultivating relations with Mr. Yoon, a conservative leader, and enhancing military ties to better counter China, North Korea and Russia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Yoon’s move appeared to catch the Biden administration by surprise. Hosting Mr. Yoon at the White House in April 2023, Mr. Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/04/26/remarks-by-president-biden-and-president-yoon-suk-yeol-of-the-republic-of-korea-in-joint-press-conference-2/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Mr. Yoon</a> that the two men “both understand that our democracies and our people are our greatest sources of strength.”</p><p>On Tuesday afternoon in Washington, the White House National Security Council released a terse statement, using an abbreviation for South Korea’s formal name, the Republic of Korea: “The administration is in contact with the R.O.K. government and is monitoring the situation closely as we work to learn more. The U.S. was not notified in advance of this announcement. We are seriously concerned by the developments we are seeing on the ground in the R.O.K.”</p><p>Officials said that aides had briefed Mr. Biden, who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/africa/biden-africa-trip-angola-cape-verde.html" title="">visiting Angola</a>.</p><p>Events moved quickly in Seoul early on Wednesday. The National Assembly voted to end martial law, and members of Mr. Yoon’s party did not come out in support of him, prompting Mr. Yoon to back down. But analysts said they expected weeks of political conflict, including his possible impeachment.</p><p>“It was a gamble he took to try to impose political control at a time when he feels frustrated by his inability to carry out his vision for the country,” said Jean H. Lee, a <a href="https://www.eastwestcenter.org/about/staff/jean-h.lee" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Korea expert</a> at the East-West Center in Hawaii.</p><p>“But at the end of the day,” she added, “President Yoon values South Korea’s alliance with the United States, its place in the world as a leading global economy and its reputation as a vibrant democracy in Asia.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>South Korea had long periods of military rule after the Korean War halted with an armistice in 1953, and it did not become a democracy until 1987.</p><p>There was speculation in Washington that Mr. Yoon might have chosen this moment because the U.S. government is in a transition from the Biden administration to the second Trump one, and because Mr. Biden is overseas. Mr. Yoon, a first-term president who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/asia/yoon-suk-yeol-south-korea-president.html" title="">barely won the 2022 election</a>, has a low approval rating, and his move against the opposition party and the legislature has echoes of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/19/us/politics/jan-6-hearing-trump.html" title="">the effort by Donald J. Trump</a> to prevent Mr. Biden from taking office after he won the 2020 election.</p><p>President-elect Donald J. Trump had no immediate reaction on Tuesday, and it is unclear how he might view Mr. Yoon’s move. The South Korean leader has been determined to court Mr. Trump, who often gripes that Seoul should pay Washington billions more for the protection of American troops. Mr. Yoon’s office even disclosed that he was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-trump-golf-271e192aa304e43419c7f73ba1ffd797" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">working on his long-dormant golf game</a> so that he could hit the links with Mr. Trump.</p><p>At a U.S.-Japan diplomatic event in Washington, Kurt M. Campbell, the deputy secretary of state and former Asia adviser to Mr. Biden, said that “our alliance with the R.O.K. is ironclad, and we stand by Korea in their time of uncertainty.”</p><p>He added that “we have every hope and expectation that any political disputes will be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Joseph Yun, a former ambassador and <a href="https://www.usip.org/people/ambassador-joseph-yun" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">special envoy for North Korea</a> in the Trump administration, said in an interview that Mr. Yoon’s move was an earthquake in domestic politics and would raise doubts about him among allied nations. </p><p>“This is a big indictment domestically and internationally of Yoon’s judgment,” he said.</p><p>The upheaval is particularly stinging for an American president who has made the promotion of democracy one of his top priorities, in part because of the rise of anti-democratic forces in the United States. Seoul hosted this year’s installment of the global democracy summit that Mr. Biden launched three years ago.</p><p>At the opening ceremony in Seoul, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken hailed South Korea as a democratic model, saying that it was fitting, “even a little bit poignant,” that the country was hosting the event.</p><p>South Korea, Mr. Blinken noted proudly, was “a nation that transformed, over a single generation, into one of the strongest, most dynamic democracies in the world, a champion of democracy for the world.”</p><p>The declaration of martial law also raises questions about what the Pentagon might do in an unstable South Korea with its nearly 30,000 troops and assets in the country. United States Forces Korea operates under the Indo-Pacific Command and in coordination with the South Korean military. American soldiers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/18/world/asia/north-korea-detained-american.html" title="">are posted</a> by the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea and in bases elsewhere in South Korea, including in Seoul, where U.S. soldiers walk the streets in uniform.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>One of Mr. Biden’s main strategies for trying to establish deterrence against China and North Korea has been to build up military relations with allies in Asia. He established a new trilateral security partnership with South Korea and Japan. Last year, he hosted Mr. Yoon and Fumio Kishida, then the prime minister of Japan, at Camp David in Maryland to announce the new arrangement, an important achievement given the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/world/asia/japan-south-korea-feud.html" title="">historical enmity</a> between South Korea and Japan.</p><p>Mr. Biden called the two nations “capable and indispensable allies.”</p><p>In his remarks, Mr. Yoon said that “the ties between our three countries, which are the most advanced liberal democracies in the region and major economies leading advanced technology and scientific innovation, are more important than ever.”</p><p>The three nations, he added, have proclaimed they “will bolster the rules-based international order and play key roles to enhance regional security and prosperity based on our shared values of freedom, human rights and rule of law.”</p><p>Adding to the uncertainty are questions about Mr. Trump’s plans for the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>In his first term as president, Mr. Trump rattled South Korea’s political leadership with complaints that Seoul should be paying more to the United States for the protection of American troops, a position he has reiterated in recent months.</p><p>The Biden administration signed an agreement with South Korea in early October under which Seoul will pay about $1.1 billion per year to defray the cost of maintaining U.S. troops in the country — a policy that American presidents have supported for decades in the name of national security, not profit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Soon after, Mr. Trump declared that South Korea, which he called “a money machine,” would be “paying us $10 billion a year” if he were president. The latest security agreement struck with the Biden administration lasts from 2026 to 2030, although Mr. Trump could insist on renegotiating it.</p><p>Mr. Trump also invested months in a dramatic personal courtship of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, whom he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/world/asia/trump-kim-jong-un-summit.html" title="">tried without success</a> to persuade to shutter Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program. Mr. Trump had a partner in President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, who wanted rapprochement with North Korea.</p><p>Mr. Yoon has taken a harder line toward Mr. Kim, although he has said he is open to talks if Mr. Kim shows a willingness to denuclearize. But Mr. Kim has adopted a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/us/politics/north-korea-war-kim.html" title="">more bellicose attitude</a> toward South Korea and the United States, and has not shown any desire for diplomacy. He signed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/19/world/asia/putin-meets-kim-north-korea.html" title="">mutual defense treaty</a> with Russia this year, and sent troops to help the Russian military in its war against Ukraine.</p><p>As for Mr. Trump, his own intentions about possibly renewing dialogue with Mr. Kim are unclear. But Mr. Yun, the veteran diplomat, said he expected Mr. Trump to try to engage again in one-on-one diplomacy.</p><p>“He likes a deal,” Mr. Yun said. “Everyone has said this is a difficult deal, and he likes to deliver on a difficult deal.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Crowley covers the State Department and U.S. foreign policy for The Times.
