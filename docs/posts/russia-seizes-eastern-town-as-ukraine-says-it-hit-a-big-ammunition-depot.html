Ukrainsk, once home to 10,000 residents, lies on the path to the city of Kurakhove, a defensive stronghold.</p><p>The capture of Ukrainsk and the Ukrainian drone strikes, which hit in the northwestern Russian town of Toropets, highlighted one of the main dynamics of the war in recent months: Russian forces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-kursk-incursion-pokrovsk.html" title="">are gaining ground in Ukraine</a>, and Kyiv is trying to disrupt that progress by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/25/world/europe/ukraine-russia-long-range-missiles.html" title="">hitting military bases</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/19/world/europe/russia-ukraine-air-assaults.html" title="">warehouses that are key to Russia’s operations</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Igor Rudenya, governor of the western Russian region of Tver, which includes Toropets, <a href="https://vk.com/tverreg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> that the town had been targeted by a “massive drone attack” but did not mention the ammunition depot. He said that wreckage from a destroyed Ukrainian drone had sparked a fire. He did not say what was burning, but the damage was significant enough that he ordered a partial evacuation of Toropets’s residents.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A still from a video posted on social media of smoke and flames after a Ukrainian drone attack in Toropets, Russia, on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Social Media, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>An official from the Ukrainian Security Services said that drones had hit a “large warehouse” in Toropets containing weapons such as Iskander missiles and guided bombs known as KABs.

Toropets is nearly 300 miles north of Ukraine and the distance of the strike would be a testament to Kyiv’s improved long-range drone capabilities. Satellite images showed that a large fire in the area was still raging early Wednesday afternoon.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1836263948322050321" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Videos</a> posted on social media and verified by The New York Times and other independent analysts showed huge balls of flame and plumes of smoke rising from several positions across a body of water.

By doing so, Russian forces can position more artillery beyond the reach of Ukrainian defenses, potentially setting the stage for a renewed offensive against Pokrovsk, Mr. Tourret added.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua/posts/pfbid02NeuVuynfHPFDqK1paDkZW9H17LQ5rHjYuuE7kcWcHu89onM2AMtWxNrPm5qy6m5Jl?rdid=x5vnIoITPknWdnwh&amp;share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2Fp%2FzVqhKkx2ejadNrh6%2F" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Ukrainian General Staff</a> reported on Wednesday 49 Russian assaults around Kurakhove over the past day. The 46th Airmobile Brigade of Ukraine <a href="https://t.me/oaembr46/1012" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Thursday</a> that Russia had launched four waves of attacks toward the city, involving a total of 46 military vehicles, including tanks. The brigade said that the attacks had been repelled, a claim that could not be independently verified.</p><p>The recent capture of Ukrainsk, which Ukraine did not comment on, could facilitate Russia’s approach to Kurakhove from the north. Russian troops have also been advancing from the east in a pincer movement, tightening pressure on the city. In the spring, Ukrainian forces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/22/world/europe/ukraine-war-defense.html" title="">built a network of trenches and anti-tank ditches</a> around Kurakhove, anticipating future assaults after losing nearby towns.</p><p>Mr. Tourret said that Kurakhove was a critical stronghold that, with the town of Vuhledar to the south, held the key to the defense of the southern part of the Donetsk region.</p><p>Roman Kostenko, the secretary of the defense and intelligence committee in the Ukrainian Parliament, <a href="https://global.espreso.tv/military-news-jewelry-work-of-ukraines-command-is-needed-sbu-colonel-kostenko-on-situation-in-kurakhove-direction" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told a national television channel on Wednesday</a> that some of his country’s troops were at risk of being encircled by the pincer movement, describing the situation as “really quite complicated.”</p><p>Maria Varenikova<!-- --> and <!-- -->Christoph Koettl<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
