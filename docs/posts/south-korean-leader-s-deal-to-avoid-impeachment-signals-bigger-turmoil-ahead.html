He was forced to rescind martial law a few hours later, after the Assembly voted against it. But the extraordinary drama briefly raised the specter that military rule would return to South Korea and propelled people onto the streets in protest. Public surveys showed that more than 70 percent of South Koreans wanted Mr. Yoon’s impeachment.</p><p>A huge letdown was in store for them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters expressed anger and disappointment as the impeachment motion failed to pass at the National Assembly in Seoul on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jun Michael Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In a move that is bound to deepen the nation’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/07/world/asia/south-korea-election-yoon.html" title="">political polarization,</a> Mr. Yoon worked out a last-minute deal with his People Power Party, or P.P.P. The party ordered its lawmakers to boycott the voting, denying the Assembly the two-thirds quorum needed to make the vote valid.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The deal was a gamble that risks expanding public anger beyond Mr. Yoon to the party as a whole, as the opposition called the party a “collaborator in his insurrection.” People gathering outside the Assembly seethed with frustration, signaling protracted political upheaval that will handicap Mr. Yoon’s already weakened ability to govern.</p><p>“His tactic worked, but only for now,” said Ahn Byong-jin, a professor of political science at Kyung Hee University in Seoul. “The people’s protest will only intensify. I don’t think this will end any time soon.”</p><p>Hours before the Assembly gathered to vote on the impeachment bill, Mr. Yoon made a televised apology to the nation. But that masked the carefully crafted political deal with his party that allowed him to stay in office, at least for now.</p><p>The opposition needed the support of just eight of the P.P.P.’s 108 lawmakers to pass the impeachment bill. For a while, that seemed achievable: Some P.P.P. lawmakers close to its chairman, Han Dong-hoon — once an ally of the president who became a staunch critic — said they wanted Mr. Yoon removed from his job immediately, indicating that they supported his impeachment. Mr. Han, too, was furious with the president, saying he learned that the martial law troops had planned to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/world/asia/south-korea-yoon-impeachment.html" title="">arrest Mr. Yoon’s political enemies</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters gathered in front of the People Power Party’s headquarters in Seoul on Saturday to pressure the party to vote for impeachment.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jun Michael Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mr. Yoon offered a compromise during his two-minute televised apology. He said he would leave it to his party to decide how long he should stay in office and how the government should be run.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Han switched his demand from Mr. Yoon’s removal from office to the shortening of his term. After Mr. Yoon’s speech, Mr. Han urged him to step down, calling his early resignation “inevitable.” But he didn’t mention impeachment. Party leaders began calling for making room for Mr. Yoon’s eventual resignation to avoid the chaos his impeachment would cause for the party.</p><p>“We will push for his orderly resignation,” Mr. Han said after the bill failed to pass through the Assembly. “The president will be effectively excluded from office until he resigns, and the prime minister will look after state affairs in consultation with the party.”</p><p>It remained unclear whether Mr. Yoon truly intends to accept a shortened term — his single five-year term ends in May 2027 — or if he was, as opposition leaders claim, just buying time for the political storm to pass while holding on to power.</p><p> The party’s reluctance to impeach Mr. Yoon derived in part from the trauma it suffered from the 2016 impeachment of President Park Geun-hye, who is the only South Korean leader to be removed from office by impeachment. If Mr. Yoon was impeached, two conservative presidents in a row would have lost their office through impeachment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A small group of President Yoon’s supporters near the National Assembly station in Seoul on Saturday.

Some of them called his martial law declaration “unconstitutional.” South Korea’s constitution allows a president to impose military rule during “wartime, warlike situations or other comparable national emergency states.”</p><p>The idea that Mr. Yoon’s political struggle with the opposition constituted such a crisis baffled Koreans. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jwp615?locale=ko_KR" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Park Jie-won,</a> a senior opposition lawmaker, accused Mr. Yoon of “using the military and police as a tool of venting his personal anger” at his critics, including the opposition-controlled National Assembly.</p><p>Even under martial law, the president cannot disrupt the National Assembly, according to legal experts. In its impeachment bill, the opposition accused Mr. Yoon of committing insurrection when he sent troops into the Assembly to detain lawmakers, including the main opposition leader, Lee Jae-myung, and his own party’s chief, Mr. Han.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“There is more than enough legal ground to impeach him,” said Park Sung-min, head of MIN Consulting, a Seoul-based political advisory company. “The P.P.P. people knew this but they needed to buy time.”</p><p>The opposition vowed to push again for Mr. Yoon’s impeachment. His removal would heighten the presidential prospects for Mr. Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Mr. Yoon but has the most public support to become the next president, according to opinion polls.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Lee, the leader of the opposition Democratic Party, leaving the National Assembly after it failed to pass a bill to impeach the president.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.

If he is convicted in coming months, leaders of Mr. Yoon’s party, including Mr. Han, hope that their chance for election will grow, political analysts said.</p><p>The president can be arrested or indicted even while in office if he commits insurrection or treason. The police and prosecutors have already started investigating whether Mr. Yoon and military generals involved in his martial law declaration committed insurrection. By law, the ringleader of an insurrection would face the death penalty or life imprisonment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Mr. Yoon won national fame as a star prosecutor who helped imprison two former presidents for corruption and abuse of power. But he has proved to be a highly divisive and deeply unpopular president, constantly clashing with the opposition over bills, policies and scandals involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee. He sent the police and prosecutors into unfriendly newsrooms in the name of collecting evidence of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/world/asia/south-korea-fake-news-disinformation.html" title="">“fake news.”</a> And then he sent the troops to the Assembly.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mun Kyoung Yang, 52, came from Gwangju, where there was a deadly crackdown under martial law in 1980.
