The changes, which took effect on Wednesday, were described in a White House executive order and guidance from Customs and Border Protection.</p><p>For the past decade, a tax loophole known as the de minimis exemption allowed goods worth up to $800 to enter the United States without import duties. The result was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/business/china-tariffs-economy-de-minimis.html" title="">millions of packages</a> shipped from China to the United States, as American shoppers got hooked on buying everything from flash drives to water bottles at low prices.</p><p>Chinese companies like Shein and Temu built their businesses around the loophole, sending goods made in Chinese factories <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/business/trump-tariffs-ups-fedex.html" title="">directly to American shoppers</a>. At the same time, China pushed its manufacturers to find buyers overseas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Last year, nearly four million packages a day entered the United States with no customs inspection and no duties paid, angering American businesses that said the loophole made it difficult for them to compete.</p><p>Mr. Trump said the loophole had created a pathway for the chemicals involved in making fentanyl to come into the United States from China because of limited checks on these packages.</p><p>Under the rules for de minimis shipments, carriers of international mail packages can pay either the 54 percent tariff or the fee of $100 per package. In practice, that means a $10 pair of cargo pants on Shein would be taxed $5.40 if the carrier chose the tariff, but for a package with 25 pairs of cargo pants, it would be cheaper to pay the flat fee. One caveat: Carriers must use the option they choose — either the tariff or the fee — on all packages they ship, and can elect to change only once a month.</p><p>In 2023, the average value of a de minimis package was $54, according to the congressional testimony of a U.S. customs official.</p><p>It is likely that much of the extra cost resulting from the new tariffs will fall on shoppers. The tariffs on these shipments are also disrupting the economics of global trade.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In Guangzhou, the center of China’s garment industry, factory owners and managers said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/business/china-tariffs-de-minimis-guangzhou.html" title="">customers were placing fewer orders</a> because of the higher prices.</p><p>Many said the drop in orders and the overall uncertainty generated by trade tensions risked making their businesses unsustainable. Some had closed their doors or hired fewer workers. Others packed up their operations for other provinces or other countries, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/10/business/trump-tariffs-vietnam-china.html" title="">like Vietnam</a>, in the hope of paying lower wages and lower export duties.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china.html" title="">trade war</a> poses a particular challenge for China, where economic growth has been largely driven by exports in recent years. New orders for export from China dropped in April to their lowest level since the end of 2022, according to official data.</p><p>On Monday, the United States and China said they would reduce their respective tariffs for 90 days with they continue negotiations, ending a standoff that had brought to a halt much of the trade between the world’s two largest economies.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Meaghan Tobin covers business and tech stories in Asia with a focus on China and is based in Taipei.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>How Pandora Will Manage the Trade War:</strong> The Danish jewelry company said it was “battle ready,” with plans to raise prices and reroute shipments from the United States, but tariffs could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/business/trump-tariffs-pandora-jewelry.html">potentially cost it millions of dollars</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tariff Truce With China</strong><strong>: </strong>President Trump’s decision to impose, and then walk back, triple-digit tariffs on Chinese products demonstrated the power and global reach of U.S. trade policy.
