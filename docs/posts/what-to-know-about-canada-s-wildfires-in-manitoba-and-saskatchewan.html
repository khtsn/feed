Their deaths represented <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/world/canada/canada-wildfires-manitoba-deaths.html" title="">an ominous start</a> to Canada’s wildfire season, which usually runs from March until October. Here’s what to know.</p><h2 id="link-7604cf93">Where are the wildfires burning?</h2><p>About 1.7 million acres have burned across both Saskatchewan and Manitoba, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. Manitoba’s out-of-control wildfires are largely burning on its northwest border with Saskatchewan. In Saskatchewan, the fire activity is also mostly concentrated in the north.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>About 17,000 people were ordered to leave and more communities can expect the same in the coming days, said Wab Kinew, the premier of Manitoba. Evacuations across those sparsely populated rural regions in Manitoba, home to several First Nations reserves, were assisted by the Canadian armed forces in cases where the conditions were more dangerous.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Evacuees from the fires at an emergency center in Winnepeg, Manitoba.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ed White/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But people in Manitoba’s Mathias Colomb Cree Nation, also known as Pukatawagan, an Indigenous community of about 3,000 people, are raising the alarm as the evacuation drags on. The army is facing delays caused by smoky conditions, and about 2,000 people have not yet been able to leave.</p><p>Thousands more residents fled 17 communities in Saskatchewan. The province has seen almost double the amount of wildfires so far this year, at 211, compared to its five-year average.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Elsewhere in Canada, fire activity has struck the northeast region of British Columbia, parts of Alberta and northwest Ontario.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-7ddee0d6">Where is the smoke affecting air quality?</h2><p>In the upper Midwest of the United States, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/weather/wildfires-canada-smoke.html" title="">issued air quality warnings</a> as smoke from the Prairie wildfires is dragged south by a cold front.</p><p>Air quality has deteriorated as higher amounts of particulate, like soot, ash and dust, are trapped in the air and blown across thousands of miles.</p><p>Officials warned residents to modify their outdoor activity, especially for higher risk groups, like children, older adults, pregnant people and those with heart or lung conditions.</p><p>In 2023, fires from Quebec caused the skies across large parts of New York to turn an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/07/nyregion/nyc-wildfire-smoke-scenes.html" title="">apocalyptic orange</a>. So far, the Prairie fires have blanketed some of the Midwest in a gray haze.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-5e879b5e">What caused the fires?</h2><p>So far, 98 of Manitoba’s 106 wildfires have been caused by people, government <a href="https://www.gov.mb.ca/conservation_fire/Fire-Situation/daily-firesituation.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data</a> shows. Four occurred naturally, probably as a result of lightning, and another four are under investigation.</p><p>Lightning, which is more common in hotter temperatures, is usually the cause of wildfires that burn the most land. In 2023, scientists at Canada’s natural resources department <a href="https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.22541/essoar.170914412.27504349/v1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> that lightning sparked fires that burned 93 percent of the total wildfire area, and the remaining seven percent of the area burned from human causes.</p><p>This year, so far, a majority of the wildfires burning in both provinces have been caused by humans, according to officials and government data, but their effect on the total area burned has not yet been determined. It’s unclear how many of those were accidental.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photo from the Manitoba Royal Canadian Mounted Police shows firefighting efforts in northern Manitoba, in May.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The Canadian Press, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-1fb55273">How is Canada responding?</h2><p>Mark Carney, Canada’s prime minister, has convened an emergency response group to address the wildfires. The government has also promised to match donations to the Canadian Red Cross, lend military aid and provide other support.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>By this time last year, the Canadian government had hosted a wildfire briefing with senior public safety officials to lay out how it was mobilizing for the season, including funding plans to support international crews, train Indigenous firefighters and buy equipment.</p><h2 id="link-58dac7df">Will the wildfires get worse?</h2><p>Strong winds and a lack of rain in the forecast mean conditions are likely to get worse over the coming days, meteorologists warn. Nighttime typically provides a reprieve, as temperatures fall, but the overnight weather has remained hot and unrelenting.</p><p>Climate change, researchers have found, is exacerbating <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/climate/california-fires-climate-change-disasters.html" title="">those conditions</a>.</p><p>Both provinces have seen intense, above-average heat this spring. That, combined with a stationary high-pressure system in central Canada, which causes air to sink downward and dry out, has primed conditions, according to Climate Central, a nonprofit research group.</p><p>Experts say June is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/world/canada/canada-wildfires-manitoba-evacuations.html" title="">critical</a> for wildfire forecasting because that is when Western Canada tends to see the most of its summer rainfall, which could partially determine the course of the rest of wildfire season.</p><p>Eight firefighters were killed in 2023, Canada’s worst wildfire season on record, but there were no civilian deaths. That year, 7,100 wildfires burned 37 million acres, an area larger than the size of England, according to the Canadian government. Scientists later called the wildfires the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/climate/canada-wildfires-emissions-carbon.html" title="">top carbon emitter</a> of 2023.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vjosa Isai is a reporter and researcher for The Times based in Toronto, where she covers news from across Canada.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
