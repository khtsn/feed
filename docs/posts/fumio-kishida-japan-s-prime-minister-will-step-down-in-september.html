    <h1>Fumio Kishida, Japan’s Prime Minister, Will Step Down in September</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>His announcement creates political uncertainty in Japan, a crucial American ally in East Asia, at a time of rising threats from China and North Korea. It is also likely to revive concerns that Japan could return to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/world/asia/japan-suga-resign-election.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">revolving door of prime ministers</a> that has characterized its political landscape in the past.</p><p>During Mr. Kishida’s time in office, he has worked closely with President Biden to enhance military and economic cooperation between the two longtime allies and with South Korea, with whom Japan’s relations have long been strained. He significantly bolstered Japan’s military defense, breaking with decades-long precedent on spending restrains.</p><p>At the same time, political analysts said that Mr. Kishida’s low ratings reflected the public’s view that he was unable to exert the strong leadership needed to turn his party in a new direction.</p><p>Numerous scandals within the party, which has governed Japan for all but four years since 1955, have led to widespread voter dissatisfaction, and the party has been searching for months for a potential successor to Mr. Kishida.</p><p>A poll last week by NHK, the national broadcaster, found that Mr. Kishida had an approval rating of just 25 percent, down from around 54 percent when he became prime minister almost three years ago.</p></div></div>
