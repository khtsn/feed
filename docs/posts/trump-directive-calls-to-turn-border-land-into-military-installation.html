Military forces patrolling that area could then temporarily detain migrants passing through for trespassing on a military reservation, said a U.S. military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters.</p><p>The directive expands a military presence that has increased steadily along the southern border, even as crossings have already dropped precipitously during the Trump administration. The ordering of troops to the border has already put the military in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/us/politics/pete-hegseth-new-defense-secretary.html" title="">politically charged territory</a>, and, depending on the details of the effort, the plan could run afoul of laws that limit the use of regular federal troops for domestic law enforcement.</p><p>The directive says that the border strip will become a “military installation under the jurisdiction of” the Pentagon. Military members would be able to stop anyone crossing into the “military installation” but would not have the power to make immigration arrests, according to the military official. Border Patrol agents could then be summoned to arrest the migrants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The memorandum formalizes a plan that the administration had been considering for weeks. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/03/19/trump-border-military-buffer-zone/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a> had reported on the plan earlier.</p><p>A White House spokesman did not respond to questions seeking clarity as to what U.S. forces operating in the strip of border land would be able to do. A Defense Department spokesman also did not respond to questions seeking clarity.</p><p>Military officials are still working out how to execute the plan, including how long troops could detain migrants before turning them over to Border Patrol agents, and what type of “no trespassing” signs needed to be installed along the border, warning migrants they were about to enter a U.S. military reservation.</p><p>Then there are other logistics that would have to be hammered out, such as the languages the signs are written in, and how far apart they are posted. There is also the question of where to position military patrols along hundreds of miles of rugged land along the border, and what additional training those troops might need.</p><p>Adam Isacson, who focuses on border security and human rights at the Washington Office on Latin America, said the memorandum appeared to create a path for using quasi-military personnel to detain migrants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A section of the memorandum calls for the authorization of state National Guard members to work on the military-controlled strip. If those working at the installation hold migrants until Customs and Border Protection officials pick them up, their use “comes very close to military personnel detaining migrants,” Mr. Isacson said.</p><p>Zolan Kanno-Youngs<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a White House correspondent for The Times, reporting on the second, nonconsecutive term of Donald J.
