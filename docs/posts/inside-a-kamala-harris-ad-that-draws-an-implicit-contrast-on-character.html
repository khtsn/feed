    <h1>Inside a Kamala Harris Ad That Draws an Implicit Contrast on Character</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="link-23ca93f8">The Script</h2><p>Harris</p><p>“As a prosecutor, I never asked a victim or a witness, ‘Are you a Republican or a Democrat?’ The only thing I ever asked them: ‘Are you OK?’ And that’s the kind of president we need right now. Someone who cares about you and is not putting themselves first. I intend to be a president for all Americans and focus on investing right now in you, the American people. And we can chart a new way forward.”</p><h2 id="link-249eb87a">Accuracy</h2><p>There are no verifiable claims.</p><h2 id="link-6991c40e">The Takeaway</h2><p>This ad is meant to portray Ms. Harris as more presidential than partisan. The promise of governing for all Americans has become a bit of a rote message — and Mr. Trump has promised to do the same — but her campaign is putting serious money behind the idea that voters still want to hear it.</p><p>The ad showcases Ms. Harris’s qualifications and does not make explicit mention of Mr. Trump. Yet it draws an unmistakable contrast between her behavior and that of the person who was standing just several feet to her right at the debate.</p><p>And it foregrounds what Ms. Harris has long considered one of her best career attributes: her years as a prosecutor who protected victims and cracked down on violent offenders.</p><p>Voters have signaled that they want to know more about Ms. Harris, and that the character of both candidates is a significant concern to them. The ad frames their choice as between a candidate who is empathetic, pragmatic and focused on moving past the political divisions of the past decade, and an opponent whose character is so well known that it needs no explicit description here.</p></div></div>
