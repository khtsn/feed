The two sides have made progress toward a cease-fire over the past week, and Mr. Netanyahu was scheduled to meet with his cabinet this week to decide on a proposal, the officials said.</p><p>The latest proposal is seen as the best chance to end fighting that has killed thousands in Lebanon and dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers, while displacing 60,000 people in Israel and about one million in Lebanon. But negotiations have been starting and stopping for weeks, and the two sides may not come to terms. Mr. Netanyahu’s office declined to comment on his intentions.</p><p>Under the proposal, Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon within 60 days, while Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia, would move north, farther from the Israeli border, according to the officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Lebanese Army would deploy to southern Lebanon to ensure that Hezbollah stays north of the Litani River, the officials said, in effect creating a buffer zone along the Israeli border.</p><p>If both sides agree, the deal would be the first cease-fire in either Lebanon or Gaza in almost exactly a year. Last November, Israel and Hamas observed a weeklong truce in Gaza while they exchanged some hostages and prisoners. Israel and Hezbollah — which had begun launching rockets at Israel weeks earlier in solidarity with Hamas — also stopped firing at each other that week, though they had not agreed to an official pact.</p><p>After that pause, however, fighting on both fronts exploded again, and it has intensified in recent months. More than 44,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war there, which began in October 2023 when Hamas attacked Israel in a raid that killed roughly 1,200 people.</p><p>A sticking point in the talks with Hezbollah appeared to be how and whether Israeli forces would be able to redeploy inside Lebanon if the truce broke down.</p><p>The officials said that Israel sought to retain the ability to take military action to push Hezbollah militants back if the Lebanese Army failed to keep them away from the border. Three of the officials said that the proposal at least implied that the United States — which has strongly backed the cease-fire proposal — would support such action.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Netanyahu appears to be more open to a deal with Hezbollah in Lebanon than with Hamas in Gaza, in large part because he is more intent on the complete destruction of Hamas than Hezbollah. Yet hard-line factions that are crucial to his political coalition have still opposed any cease-fire, and on Monday, Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, publicly urged Mr. Netanyahu to reject the proposal.</p><p>“An agreement with Lebanon is a big mistake. A historic missed opportunity to eradicate Hezbollah,” <a href="https://x.com/itamarbengvir/status/1860968582449946679" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said</a>. “As I warned before in Gaza, I warn now as well: Mr. Prime Minister, it is not too late to stop this agreement! We must continue until absolute victory!”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/world/middleeast/us-envoy-lebanon-israel-hezbollah.html" title="">the Biden administration dispatched a top envoy</a>, Amos Hochstein, to Israel and Lebanon to push for a deal. At the same time, Israel and Hezbollah, each seeking leverage in what could be the closing phase of talks, have launched some of the heaviest aerial attacks at each other since the fighting began.</p><p>On Sunday, Israeli officials said Hezbollah had fired at least 250 projectiles, a term often used for rockets, into Israel, including many toward Tel Aviv, injuring at least 13 people. In Lebanon, Israeli forces issued a series of sweeping evacuation orders for the area south of Beirut on Sunday night before striking what they said were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/24/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-lebanon.html" title="">a dozen Hezbollah command centers</a>. There were no immediate reports of casualties in those strikes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The heavy exchange of fire continued on Monday, causing schools to close on both sides of the border. The Israeli military said it had struck at least 25 Hezbollah targets across Lebanon, including what it said were buildings used by Hezbollah’s leadership and intelligence operations. At the same time, in parts of northern Israel, residents scrambled to shelters as a new round of sirens announced about 30 incoming projectiles from Lebanon. Israeli officials said at least some had been intercepted by Israeli missiles.</p><p>At least seven people in Lebanon were injured in Israeli strikes on Monday, according to Lebanese state news media. In northern Israel, officials said that a 60-year-old man had been hurt in an attack from Lebanon.</p><p>Since the start of the war, Israeli attacks have killed more than 3,500 people in Lebanon, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. Israeli officials said Hezbollah attacks have killed 47 civilians, and Israeli’s military said 46 soldiers had died in the fighting. The death count is lower in Israel in part because the country’s air-defense systems have intercepted most rockets before they hit populated areas.</p><p>If Israel and Hezbollah fail to approve the proposed cease-fire by Thursday, two of the officials said they believed it could be finalized by the weekend.</p><p>Johnatan Reiss<!-- --> contributed reporting from Tel Aviv and <!-- -->Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> from Rehovot, Israel.</p><ul><li></li></ul></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick Kingsley is The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief, leading coverage of Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-kingsley">More about Patrick Kingsley</a></span></p></div><div><p>Jack Nicas is a foreign correspondent for The Times, covering the conflict in the Middle East from Jerusalem.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jack-nicas">More about Jack Nicas</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
