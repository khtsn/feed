It was also a moment Mr. Netanyahu seemed determined to transcend.</p><p>“I am shocked by the magnitude of this absurdity,” Mr. Netanyahu said.</p><p>“I am the prime minister, I am running a country, I am running a war,” he continued. “I am not occupying myself with my future, but rather with that of the state of Israel.”</p><p>For nearly a decade, the corruption charges against Mr. Netanyahu have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-corruption.html" title="">divided Israel</a>, leading to years of political turmoil. The electorate has been roughly evenly split on the question of whether Mr. Netanyahu should remain in office while he stands trial — a dynamic that has created an electoral stalemate, leading to five elections in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/20/world/middleeast/israel-election-government-collapse.html" title="">less than four years</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Apart from a brief court appearance to plead not guilty in 2021, Mr. Netanyahu’s day-to-day schedule had rarely been affected by the trial proceedings.</p><p>Prosecutors and defense lawyers spent years interviewing witnesses instead of the defendant himself. The hearing on Tuesday — 1,661 days since the trial began — was Mr. Netanyahu’s first full day in court.</p><p>While his appearance provided a crescendo in the judicial process, it was also, to many Israelis, anti-climactic. The charges against Mr. Netanyahu have been a part of Israeli discourse for so long that the spectacle of a prime minister in the dock no longer seems as shocking as it once did.</p><p>“The public has completely accepted the idea that we have a sitting prime minister who has been investigated, indicted and is now on trial — even in the middle of a war,” said Dahlia Scheindlin, a political analyst who attended the hearing on Tuesday.</p><p>“What would have been unimaginable 10 years ago has been completely normalized,” she added.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu is charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three separate but related cases. The charges center on claims that he gave regulatory favors and diplomatic support to prominent businessmen in exchange for gifts, including cigars and Champagne, as well as sympathetic media coverage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The trial is expected to continue for years, and Mr. Netanyahu will likely take the stand several times a week for several months.</p><p>To Mr. Netanyahu’s critics, the trial is a litmus test for democracy: a chance to see whether a sitting prime minister, who has refused to resign, can be held to account for crimes he is accused of committing in office.</p><p>To his supporters, it constitutes an attack on democracy: an attempt by the country’s liberal establishment to oust Mr. Netanyahu on spurious legal grounds after failing to do so at the ballot box.</p><p>“A disgrace,” shouted Tally Gotliv, a lawmaker from Mr. Netanyahu’s party, shortly before the hearing began.</p><p>“Persecution,” said Itamar Ben-Gvir, one of several government ministers who attended the hearing in solidarity with their leader.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Netanyahu had sought to delay his testimony by several months, arguing that his management of the war campaign had disrupted his preparations. But the court agreed to a postponement of only a few days.</p><p>Still, in recognition of the threat that Mr. Netanyahu faces as a wartime prime minister, the judges agreed to hold the hearing in a more secure, underground courtroom in Tel Aviv instead of the East Jerusalem courthouse where the trial usually takes place.</p><p>For most of the day, Mr. Netanyahu was interviewed by his own lawyer, Amit Haddad; the prosecution will cross-examine Mr. Netanyahu in the coming weeks.</p><p>Mr. Haddad’s opening questions allowed Mr. Netanyahu to describe how, as a busy prime minister, he has little time to devote to corrupt activity — or to the trial.</p><p>“Sometimes I even indulge in a cigar, although I can’t even finish it all at once, because I’m having so many meetings and briefings,” Mr. Netanyahu said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>As if to illustrate his point, the prime minister’s aides approached the stand several times to pass him notes, apparently about matters of state. At one point during the morning session, the trial was briefly paused to allow Mr. Netanyahu to deal with what he said was an urgent matter.</p><p>“There needs to be a balance between the necessities of the trial — which I appreciate — and the necessities of the country,” the prime minister said of the notes.</p><p>Still, neither Mr. Netanyahu or his lawyer was in a rush to discuss the substantive parts of the prosecution’s case.</p><p>For more than an hour, Mr. Haddad asked open-ended questions about Mr. Netanyahu’s life and opinions, allowing the prime minister to expand at length about his political achievements. At times, Mr. Netanyahu’s words felt more like a political speech aimed at his right-wing base than the responses of a defendant in a courtroom.</p><p>He described his policies as finance minister during the 2000s, as well as his efforts to oppose Palestinian sovereignty in the 2010s — positions that led to him to clash, he said, with the Obama administration as well as the Israeli media establishment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I worked to strengthen Israel’s security, to strengthen Israel’s economy, to change it to a free market,” he said. “That is what I have devoted my life to, standing against pressures at home and abroad.”</p><p>As the afternoon wore on, Mr. Netanyahu began to speak to some of the specific corruption charges against him. In one case, prosecutors say he authorized regulatory benefits for an Israeli telecoms magnate, Shaul Elovitch, in exchange for favorable coverage on Mr. Elovitch’s popular news site, Walla. Mr. Elovitch is also on trial and has denied wrongdoing.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu dismissed Walla as a “negligible news site,” rebuffing accusations that he would seek to shape its content. “It’s a site of dogs and cats,” he said.</p><p>He also disputed the idea that he had signed off on regulatory changes specifically to favor Mr. Elovitch, saying that he simply signed documents that civil servants had presented him.</p><p>“Many times you don’t even know what you’re signing,” said Mr. Netanyahu. “It comes from the bureaucracy, so you sign.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The court’s granular and domestic focus stood in stark contrast to the grander accusations leveled at Mr. Netanyahu by the International Criminal Court in The Hague. The court has issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Netanyahu, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/icc-arrest-warrants-israel-hamas.html" title="">accusing him of war crimes</a> during the ongoing war in Gaza.</p><p>At the courthouse on Tuesday, the main reminder of Gaza came from a group of left-wing demonstrators who stood outside the courthouse calling for a cease-fire.</p><p>Myra Noveck contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick Kingsley is The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief, leading coverage of Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-kingsley">More about Patrick Kingsley</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
