It was also a moment Mr. Netanyahu seemed determined to transcend.</p><p>“I am shocked by the magnitude of this absurdity,” Mr. Netanyahu said.</p><p>“I am the prime minister, I am running a country, I am running a war,” he continued. “I am not occupying myself with my future, but rather with that of the state of Israel.”</p><p>For nearly a decade, the corruption charges against Mr. Netanyahu have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-corruption.html" title="">divided Israel</a>, leading to years of political turmoil. The electorate has been roughly evenly split on the question of whether Mr. Netanyahu should remain in office while he stands trial — a dynamic that has created an electoral stalemate, leading to five elections in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/20/world/middleeast/israel-election-government-collapse.html" title="">less than four years</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Apart from a brief court appearance to plead not guilty in 2021, Mr. Netanyahu had rarely been affected by the day-to-day proceedings of the trial.</p><p>Prosecutors and defense lawyers spent years interviewing witnesses instead of the defendant himself. The hearing on Tuesday — 1,661 days since the trial began — was set to be Mr. Netanyahu’s first full day in court.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu had sought to delay his testimony by several months, arguing that his management of the war campaign had disrupted his preparations. But the court agreed to a postponement of only a few days.</p><p>While his appearance on Tuesday provided a crescendo in the judicial process, it was also, to many Israelis, anti-climactic. The charges against Mr. Netanyahu have been a part of Israeli discourse for so long that the spectacle of a prime minister on trial no longer seems as shocking as it once did.</p><p>“The public has completely accepted the idea that we have a sitting prime minister who has been investigated, indicted and is now on trial — even in the middle of a war,” said Dahlia Scheindlin, a political analyst who attended the hearing on Tuesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“What would have been unimaginable 10 years ago has been completely normalized,” she added.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu is charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three separate but related cases. The charges center on claims that he gave regulatory favors and diplomatic support to prominent businessmen in exchange for gifts and sympathetic media coverage.</p><p>The trial is expected to continue for years, and Mr. Netanyahu will likely take the stand several times a week for several months.</p><p>To Mr. Netanyahu’s critics, the trial is a litmus test for democracy: a chance to see whether a sitting prime minister, who has refused to resign of his own accord, can be held to account for crimes he is accused of committing in office.</p><p>To his supporters, it constitutes an attack on democracy: an attempt by the country’s liberal establishment to oust Mr. Netanyahu on spurious judicial grounds after failing to do so at the ballot box.</p><p>“A disgrace,” shouted Tally Gotliv, a lawmaker from Mr. Netanyahu’s party, shortly before the hearing began.</p><p>“Persecution,” said Itamar Ben-Gvir, one of several government ministers to attend the hearing in solidarity with their leader.</p><p>Myra Noveck contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick Kingsley is The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief, leading coverage of Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-kingsley">More about Patrick Kingsley</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
