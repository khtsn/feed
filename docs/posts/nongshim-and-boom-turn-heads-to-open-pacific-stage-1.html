A handful of teams debuted new rosters while the region&#39;s pair of Ascension teams remained unchanged and unbeaten.</p>

<p>The results from the first weekend&#39;s slate of matches were:</p>



<p>All matches in Group Omega ended in 2-1, leaving early wins and losses a narrow margin with much of the stage still left to play. Meanwhile, Global Esports triumphed 2-0 over DetonatioN FocusMe to sit atop the group, tailed closely by BOOM Esports, who had quite possibly the most surprising result of the week. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a> winners T1 shook off some rust as well, giving up their map pick to ZETA Division after stealing their opponents&#39; map pick en route to a 2-1 victory. <span data-ref-id="12">

</span>, who earned the MVP bracelet in Bangkok for his efforts, picked up where he left off, tallying server-highs in rating and kills.</p>

<p>In a clash between historical Pacific powerhouses, DRX triumphed over Paper Rex. The matchup saw the Korean side adapt to the ever-changing meta after a successful Kickoff, seeing <span data-ref-id="13">
