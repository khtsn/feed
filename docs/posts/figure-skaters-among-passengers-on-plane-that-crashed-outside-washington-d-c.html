As of early Thursday morning, no fatalities had been confirmed.</p><p>Jon Maravilla, an American pair figure skater, told RIA Novosti, a Russian state news agency, that there were “about 14 figure skaters on the plane, not counting their parents and coaches.”</p><p>“Such a tragedy,” Mr. Maravilla said, adding that he did not want to give their names. U.S. Figure Skating did not confirm the number of its members on board and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Russian state news agencies also reported that three former figure skaters from Russia were on the plane.</p><p>The U.S. national championships are held annually in different cities around the country. Leading up to the competition, skaters must compete in qualifying rounds at regional competitions. U.S. Figure Skating was founded in 1921 and is based in Colorado Springs. It comprises both amateur and professional skating clubs and has almost 900 member clubs.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jin-yu-young">More about Jin Yu Young</a></span></p></div><div><p>Ivan Nechepurenko covers Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the countries of the Caucasus, and Central Asia.
