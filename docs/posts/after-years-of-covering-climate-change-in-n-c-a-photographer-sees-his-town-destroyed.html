The trees silhouetted against the night sky whipped violently back and forth.</p><p>“It’s too much rain,” I kept thinking to myself. Our house was surrounded by large trees on all sides. We were fixated on the reality that at any moment, one of those trees could come crashing through the roof.</p><p>By late morning, as the winds and rain subsided, so did my anxiety. But not for long.</p><p>I’ve lived in the Asheville region of North Carolina my entire life, and I moved to Swannanoa, a small town just 11 miles east of downtown Asheville, nine years ago. I have been photographing for The New York Times for over 15 years and have covered the effects <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/climate/climate-towns-bankruptcy.html" title="">of climate change in North Carolina</a> in the past.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/03/multimedia/00nat-swannanoa-photos-09-qfcm/00nat-swannanoa-photos-09-qfcm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/03/multimedia/00nat-swannanoa-photos-09-qfcm/00nat-swannanoa-photos-09-qfcm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/03/multimedia/00nat-swannanoa-photos-09-qfcm/00nat-swannanoa-photos-09-qfcm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A man in a blue-and-white-striped shirt, walks through the mud.

Entire neighborhoods were being swept down river.</p><p>When we finally made our way closer to the Swannanoa River, which runs through the town, nothing could have prepared me for the scene I took in.

We were starting to understand the scale of the destruction in the only place I’ve ever known.
