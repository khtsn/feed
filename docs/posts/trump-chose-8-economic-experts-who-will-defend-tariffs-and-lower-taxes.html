In the 1990s, he gained notoriety by betting against the British pound and earning his firm, Soros Fund Management, $1 billion.</p><p>As an adviser to Mr. Trump’s campaign, Mr. Bessent promoted a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/business/trump-bessent-economic-strategy.html" title="">3-3-3 plan</a> that entails increasing growth to 3 percent, cutting the budget deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product and raising U.S. energy production by three million barrels of oil per day, or the equivalent in other fuels.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-2a0923dd">Howard Lutnick</h2><p>Commerce Secretary</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rob Kim/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Howard Lutnick acquired a reputation as a cutthroat trader during his decades on Wall Street as chief executive of Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial services company that specializes in government bonds.

But in a twist, Mr. Trump gave Mr. Lutnick authority over the Office of the United States Trade Representative, a separate agency that could be key to fulfilling Mr. Trump’s trade plans. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Lutnick <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/business/dealbook/howard-lutnick-commerce-secretary-trump.html" title="">has advocated imposing tariffs</a> to protect U.S. industries from foreign competition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-5c5fb2fd">Jamieson Greer</h2><p>U.S. Trade Representative</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rodrigo Garrido/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>As Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator, Jamieson Greer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/business/economy/jamieson-greer-trade-representative.html" title="">will be responsible for facing off</a> with other countries over trade issues.
