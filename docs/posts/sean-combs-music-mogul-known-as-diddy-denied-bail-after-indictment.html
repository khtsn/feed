Blige, and his sprawling business empire and star-studded parties made him a tabloid fixture.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/17/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-indictment.html" title="">in a federal indictment unsealed on Tuesday</a>, Mr. Combs was also described as the boss of a yearslong criminal enterprise that threatened and abused women, coercing them to participate against their will in drug-fueled orgies with male prostitutes and threatening them with violence or the loss of financial support if they refused.</p><p>The 14-page indictment against Mr. Combs, a producer, record executive and performer who is also known as Diddy and Puff Daddy, includes three counts of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. Prosecutors said that to commit these acts, Mr. Combs and his employees engaged in kidnapping, forced labor, arson and bribery, and kept firearms at the ready.</p><p>Prosecutors asked a magistrate judge to hold Mr. Combs without bail, saying that he was “dangerous and poses an ongoing threat to the safety of the community,” citing the threats of violence outlined in the indictment and weapons found in raids on his homes in March, including AR-15-style rifles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/sean-diddy-combs-arrested-court-5d570cab4625ca5f9dd16dfd7df4437c" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Combs, 54, pleaded not guilty</a> at a federal courthouse in Manhattan on Tuesday. The racketeering charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison, and a sex trafficking conviction would carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years.</p><p>“He’s going to fight this with all of his energy and all of his might, and the full confidence of his lawyers,” Marc Agnifilo, one of Mr. Combs’s lawyers, said on Tuesday morning. “And I expect a long battle with a good result for Mr. Combs.”</p><p>Mr. Agnifilo and another of Mr. Combs’s lawyers, Teny Geragos, asked the court to allow their client bail, suggesting a $50 million bond that they say is secured by equity in his $48 million home in Miami Beach. As evidence that Mr. Combs is not a flight risk, they informed the judge that his lawyer took his passport in April, that they have informed prosecutors of all domestic travel and that his private plane was pending sale.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, shared details of the weapons found in raids at Mr. Combs’s homes.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The charges against Mr. Combs were revealed a day after he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-indicted.html" title="">arrested in a Manhattan hotel room</a>, following an investigation that has been active since at least early this year.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>They are a stunning repudiation of Mr. Combs’s public image. He was one of the most influential figures in the spread of hip-hop as a global commercial force, and built a business empire based largely on his raffish, street-smart personal brand. Those included the Sean John fashion line and a partnership with the liquor giant Diageo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/12/arts/music/diddy-sean-combs-deleon-sale.html" title="">that over the years earned him more than a billion dollars.</a></p><p>Although he has long been trailed by accusations of violence, he was largely unscathed until a series of civil lawsuits over the past year accused him of sexual assault and other allegations of sexual misconduct. His business empire began to crumble as a federal investigation swirled around him.</p><p>The indictment, which was filed with the court last week and unsealed on Tuesday, includes graphic descriptions of what it says Mr. Combs called “freak offs”: “highly orchestrated performances of sexual activity” in hotels and other locations that were fueled by drugs and could go on for days. At these events, the government says, women were plied with drugs to keep them “obedient” and coerced to participate in sex with prostitutes.</p><p>Those coerced to participate in the orgies “typically received IV fluids to recover from the physical exertion and drug use,” according to the indictment.</p><p>Mr. Combs would watch these events, sometimes while masturbating and recording video. According to the government, Mr. Combs “used the sensitive, embarrassing and incriminating recordings that he made during Freak Offs as collateral to ensure the continued obedience and silence of the victims.”</p><p>Prosecutors asserted that the women believed they could not refuse his demands without physical or emotional abuse, or without fearing that their financial or job security would be put at risk. They alleged that Mr. Combs maintained control over women by tracking their location, dictating their appearance, monitoring their medical information and supplying them with drugs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>No victims are named in the indictment, and the government’s sex trafficking count mentions only an anonymous “Victim 1.”</p><p>But the descriptions of the events appear to mirror accusations made in a lawsuit last year by Casandra Ventura, Mr. Combs’s former girlfriend and an artist signed to his record label, Bad Boy, under the name Cassie.</p><p>Ms. Ventura <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/arts/music/cassie-diddy-sean-combs-settlement.html" title="">settled her lawsuit</a>, which was filed in November, after just one day, with Mr. Combs denying any wrongdoing. But the indictment describes orgies in similar terms to Ms. Ventura’s suit, saying they involved copious amounts of drugs and other supplies.</p><p>As part of the government argument that Mr. Combs should be denied bail, prosecutors accused him of obstructing justice after Ms. Ventura’s lawsuit. They wrote in court papers that he and his associates reached out to potential victims and witnesses to “feed” them “false narratives,” including by making several calls to someone prosecutors describe as a victim of his sexual abuse.</p><p>“During the calls, the defendant repeatedly asked for the victim’s support and ‘friendship,’ and attempted to convince the victim that she had willingly engaged in acts constituting sexual abuse,” prosecutors wrote in court papers.</p><p>When <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/arts/music/diddy-sean-combs-home-raided.html" title="">federal agents raided Mr. Combs’s homes</a> in Los Angeles and Miami Beach in March, the indictment said, “law enforcement seized various Freak Off supplies, including narcotics and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant.” It was in Miami Beach that agents found nine AR-15-style weapons — six with serial numbers intact, and three with them defaced.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The arrest of Mr. Combs makes him the highest-profile figure in the music world to face criminal charges for sexual misconduct since R. Kelly, the R&amp;B singer, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/29/nyregion/r-kelly-racketeering-sex-abuse.html" title="">sentenced in 2022 to more than 30 years in prison</a> for child sex crimes, sex trafficking and racketeering.</p><p>In the months after Ms. Ventura sued Mr. Combs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/diddy-sean-combs-lawsuit-allegations.html" title="">five women filed lawsuits</a> alleging sexual assault, and three other suits included accusations of sexual misconduct. His lawyers are fighting all of them in court.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Marc Agnifilo, one of Mr. Combs’s lawyers, addressed reporters outside the federal courthouse on Tuesday morning. He’s going to fight this with all of his energy and all of his might,” Mr. Agnifilo said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>After his arrest on Monday, lawyers for Mr. Combs said they were disappointed with the decision to prosecute him.</p><p>“Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs is a music icon, self-made entrepreneur, loving family man and proven philanthropist who has spent the last 30 years building an empire, adoring his children and working to uplift the Black community,” Mr. Combs’s legal team said in a statement. “He is an imperfect person but he is not a criminal.”</p><p>In seeking Mr. Combs’s release, his lawyers pointed to the fact that he had voluntarily traveled to New York in anticipation of an indictment and offered to turn himself in to the authorities at their request.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“These are the acts of an innocent man with nothing to hide,” his lawyers added, “and he looks forward to clearing his name in court.”</p><p>For more than a week, Mr. Combs had been staying at the Park Hyatt New York hotel on West 57th Street, largely hunkering down while awaiting any news but also drawing some attention on social media with a visit to Harlem, where he was born.</p><p>Speculation about the federal case against Mr. Combs has been building ever since the raids on his homes. Prosecutors have been sending subpoenas to witnesses for months.</p><p>A lawyer for Ms. Ventura, Douglas H. Wigdor, declined to comment on the government’s indictment. Lawyers for other women who have filed suits against Mr. Combs hailed the arrest.</p><p>“It’s a big, moving day for victims, but an arrest is only the beginning,” said Lisa Bloom, whose client, the singer Dawn Richard — a former member of two musical groups that were assembled by Mr. Combs — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/arts/music/dawn-richard-danity-kane-lawsuit-sean-combs-diddy.html" title="">filed suit just last week</a>.</p><p>At a news conference in Manhattan after the indictment was unsealed, Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, encouraged anyone with more information to come forward.</p><p>“This office is determined to investigate and prosecute anyone who engages in sex trafficking,” Mr. Williams said, “no matter how powerful or wealthy or famous you may be.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ben-sisario">More about Ben Sisario</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
