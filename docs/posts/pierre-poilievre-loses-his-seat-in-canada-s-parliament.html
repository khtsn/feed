    <h1>Pierre Poilievre Loses His Seat in Canada’s Parliament</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While Mr. Poilievre championed Canada’s large oil and gas industry, Mr. Fanjoy <a href="https://x.com/brucefanjoy/status/1914792236245467394" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">campaigned</a> on “growing the green economy” and “real climate action.”</p><p>In a <a href="https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/change-carleton-riding-liberal" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent opinion essay in the Ottawa Citizen,</a> he wrote, “We need to do more to fight climate change.”</p><p>Mr. Fanjoy incorporated common measures to reduce household emissions of greenhouse gases in his own family home in the Ottawa suburbs, <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2023/08/28/news/big-blue-house-runs-green-and-clean" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to an article about it in The National Observer</a>. The house was fitted with rooftop solar panels and an electric heat pump, so when the panels generate excess electricity in the summer, he can sell it back to the grid.</p><p>“One of the challenges that we face in moving towards a more sustainable world is I think a lot of people think that we’re going to lose benefits, it’s not going to be as nice, we’re gonna have to live in an austere environment,” Mr. Fanjoy told the publication. “I don’t think that’s the case at all. We just do things differently, but it’s going to be better.”</p></div></div>
