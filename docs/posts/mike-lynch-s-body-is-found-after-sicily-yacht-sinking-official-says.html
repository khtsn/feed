He said the bodies were found “in the cabins,” although it remained unclear if they were all found in the same cabin or in different ones. </p></div></div><div><div><p>The rescue teams managed to recover four bodies on Wednesday and one on Thursday, bringing them ashore in body bags in front of a crowd of reporters and onlookers.</p><p>The priority remained “the recovery of the missing body,” said Mr. Mariani. Once that search had been completed, the judicial authorities would decide the next steps, he said.</p><p>The bodies recovered so far were already at the disposal of prosecutors, he said, “and then there is the investigative phase,” which would include the recovery of the yacht.</p><p>The Italian prosecutors handling the case have attracted strong criticism from the local press association because of their reluctance in sharing any information with reporters. </p><p>As of Thursday, they had not held a news conference or released a statement on the investigation, generating what the Sicilian press association called “a black market of news” that made it hard to verify information. </p></div></div><div><div><p>Finally, on Thursday afternoon, Ambrogio Cartosio, the prosecutor handling the case, said that a news conference would be held on Saturday at 10 a.m. in the town of Termini Imerese, where his office is located.<span>  </span></p><p>Mr. Mariani said the operations to recover the bodies had gone quickly, taking into account that the ship was 165 feet underwater, so that the divers had a limited amount of time — about 12 minutes — to operate before coming up.</p><p>“It was complicated and also potentially dangerous for the divers,” he said, because of the size of the yacht. “There are objective difficulties, thankfully they are well trained and know what they are doing.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Elisabetta Povoledo is a reporter based in Rome, covering Italy, the Vatican and the culture of the region.
