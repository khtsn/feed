Morvillo, a lawyer at Clifford Chance; and his wife, Neda Morvillo.</p><p>“This is an unimaginable grief to shoulder,” the Bloomer family said in a statement. “Our parents were incredible people.”</p><p>The Morvillo family said it was “completely devastated by the passing of Chris and Neda,” and added, “Their passing is a tremendous loss.”</p><p>The yacht was caught in a sudden downpour. Weather experts said that strong winds and lightning had hit the area and that the yacht had most likely been struck by air generated within a thunderstorm descending rapidly or by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/world/europe/waterspout-yacht-sinks-sicily.html" title="">waterspout</a>, similar to a tornado over water.</p></div></div><div><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="bayesian-yacht-annotation" data-id="100000009649909" data-source-id="100000009649909"><div data-sourceid="100000009649909" id="embed-id-100000009649909">
