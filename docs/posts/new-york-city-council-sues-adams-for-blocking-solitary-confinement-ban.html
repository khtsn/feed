They have disagreed over housing policies, a law to document more police stops, budget cuts to libraries, and closing the Rikers Island jail complex, among other issues.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The City Council approved a law last December <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/20/nyregion/solitary-confinement-jails-nyc.html" title="">banning solitary confinement</a> in most cases in city jails, arguing that the practice amounted to torture. Mr. Adams vetoed the bill, and the Council overrode his veto.</p><p>In July, on the day before the law was set to go into effect, Mr. Adams <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/nyregion/adams-suspends-solitary-confinement-law.html" title="">declared a state of emergency</a> in city jails and issued an order that blocked key parts of the law. The mayor has repeatedly extended the emergency declaration.</p><p>Mr. Adams argued that the emergency order was necessary because the law would “remove key tools necessary to mitigate the risk of violence” in jails and would “pose a direct threat to the safety of incarcerated individuals and staff.” The correction officers’ union also opposed the law and said that it would lead to more assaults of officers.</p><p>The mayor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The city’s public advocate, Jumaane Williams, a fierce critic of the mayor who was a sponsor of the solitary confinement ban, joined the Council in filing the lawsuit.</p><p>The lawsuit argues that Mr. Adams’s actions set a “dangerous precedent” for mayors who are unhappy with the outcome of policy debates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Solitary confinement, also known as punitive segregation, refers to the practice of holding a detainee alone in a cell for most of the day. The bill would ban it beyond a four-hour “de-escalation” period during an emergency and would require that all detainees spend at least 14 hours outside of cells each day.</p><p>The jail at Rikers Island is at a major crossroads. Last month, a federal judge overseeing the complex <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/nyregion/rikers-contempt-receivership.html" title="">found the city in contempt</a> for failing to stem violence and excessive force at the facility and said she was leaning toward taking control of the city’s jails.</p><p>The solitary confinement ban was prompted in part by the deaths of several people who were in custody at Rikers or had recently been released. In 2019, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/nyregion/layleen-polanco-xtravaganza-death-rikers-island.html" title="">Layleen Polanco</a>, a transgender woman, had an epileptic seizure and died while in solitary after guards failed to check on her.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
