News outlets called it a purge.</p><p>“That only leaves — no one knows how many left. I have no idea,” Jon Stewart said on Monday’s “Daily Show.”</p><blockquote><p>“The point is, we have 17 less inspectors general.

Yeah, but maybe Trump is getting rid of all the oversight so no one sees him doing anything good! He’s so humble.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“For some reason, we have given presidents the power of a king, and then we say, ‘Oh, by the way, with that power, you’re not going to get all, like, kingly and <em>[expletive]</em> on us, right?’ To put that in constitutional terms, if I could: ‘Don’t hate the player, hate the founding fathers.’” <em>— JON STEWART</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-6b59a72a">Big, Beautiful Valves</h2><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/24/us/president-trump-news" title="">Trump visited Los Angeles</a> a few days ago to observe the damage from the wildfires.

He keeps talking about these imaginary valves that we refuse to turn. What goes on in this brain of his? We’ve got giant valves, he’s got gold coins — it’s like Super Mario Bros. in there.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“President Trump and first lady Melania Trump on Friday traveled to California and toured wildfire damage by helicopter. Said Trump afterward, ‘It’s been years since we laughed together like that.’” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p><p>“I know it’s been a tough time here for us Angelenos, right? I mean, last week, a lot of people lost their homes to the fire. This week, a lot of people lost their gardeners to ICE.” <em>— BILL MAHER</em></p><p>“You know, and we’re not out of the woods yet with the fires, right? That came up again.
