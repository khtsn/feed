<p>The opening match of the VCT season pitted the new team on the block against EG. Having risen from Ascension, ENVY was new to the big stage, something that showed in the first map of the series.</p>

<p>Starting on Abyss, EG were completely dominant in the first half. Featuring the new agent Veto for the first time in VCT, rookie <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/34400/bao">
		bao	</a>
</span>&#39;s defensive setups alongside <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/8873/dgzin">
		dgzin	</a>
</span>&#39;s prowess on the Outlaw and Operator completely shut down ENVY&#39;s attack half. They quickly racked up 10 rounds on the half against the shaky looking ENVY.</p>


<p><em>bao&#39;s showcases Veto&#39;s power on defense.</em></p>

<p>Moving to the second half, however, ENVY began mounting a comeback. They brought the final score on the map to a more respectable 9-13, with EG inevitably closing out the map. The momentum had shifted into ENVY&#39;s hands, as players like <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/1129/rossy">
		Rossy	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/53/inspire">
		Inspire	</a>
</span> had begun to heat up in the ladder half of the map to give EG a small scare.</p>


<p><em>Inspire starts to make EG sweat.</em></p>

<p>While Abyss was ENVY&#39;s map pick, they seemed much more warmed up to the stage going into EG”s map pick of Corrode. The map was neck and neck all the way through, but ENVY was able to seal the map on a thrifty win in the final round.</p>

<p>With the map score tied at one, the teams went to Bind for the decider. Riding off their first VCT map win, ENVY jumped out to a 6-0 lead. EG regained their footing however, and brought the score at half up to 5-7. They were looking to tie it at 7-7 with a pistol round win, but their second round anti-eco went awry, putting ENVY back in the driver seat. They rode that one round out to a comfortable 13-9 win, completing their first ever VCT match.</p>

<p>The second match of the day saw Cloud9 take on LOUD, both teams with relatively minor changes since 2025. Cloud9, ending last season only one win away from Champions, are still looking to qualify for their first international event of the partnership era. They have maintained a core three, while adding a new IGL in <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/729/zellsis">
		Zellsis	</a>
</span>, plus a new Sentinel in <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7716/penny">
		penny	</a>
</span>. LOUD, on the other hand, are coming off the back of the season where they only found one win across Stage 1 and 2. However, still believing in their talent, they have kept four out of five of the players from their Stage 2 roster, only adding the rookie <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/10557/darker">
		Darker	</a>
</span> from LATAM tier two.</p>

<p>The match started out on Haven, where LOUD jumped out to an early 5-2 lead. However, once Cloud9 got settled, they comfortably won the map 13-7, with <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/18796/oxy">
		OXY	</a>
</span> delivering a prime performance on Neon.</p>

<p>Map two of Abyss was a much closer affair, and one that LOUD seemed postured to win. <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/28716/lukxo">
		lukxo	</a>
</span>, continuing to build off his impressive rookie season, put up a dominant performance on Chamber.</p>


<p><em>lukxo has not missed a beat since last year.</em></p>

<p>lukxo&#39;s performance gave LOUD the advantage in the map, and were up 9-5 in the second half. However, after a big round from Penny, the second player to feature Veto on the day, Cloud9 was able to fight back into the map. Their attack half went smoothly, winning the map 13-11 to close out the series in a 2-0</p>

<p>Cloud9 will move on to face the reigning Champions NRG in the next round of the bracket.</p>

<p>Americas will continue tomorrow with <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/596400/kr-esports-vs-furia-vct-2026-americas-kickoff-ur1" target="_blank">KRÜ vs. FURIA</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/596401/100-thieves-vs-leviat-n-vct-2026-americas-kickoff-ur1" target="_blank">100T vs. LEVIATÁN</a>.</p>
