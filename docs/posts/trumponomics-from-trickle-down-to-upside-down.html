But Donald Trump has managed something remarkable: He’s making traditional right-wing economic nonsense look relatively sensible in retrospect.</p><p>Ever since the rise of Ronald Reagan, Republicans have been vocal believers in the magical power of tax cuts for the rich. The idea was that if you reduced tax rates at the top, “job creators” would respond with a surge of productive energy, boosting the economy — hence trickling down to the middle class — and maybe even reducing the budget deficit.</p><p>This idea wasn’t unadulterated nonsense. Rather, it was adulterated nonsense. It described something that could happen in principle but doesn’t happen in practice; tax cuts never produced the promised economic surge, tax hikes never had the predicted destructive effects. Still, it remained party orthodoxy, largely because rich people put their money behind a doctrine that called for cutting their taxes.</p><p>But Trumponomics, which increasingly seems to center on tariffs — which are, by the way, taxes — as the answer to all problems really is unadulterated nonsense. Until this week, Trump’s big claim was that taxes on imports won’t raise prices to consumers, which is not only completely at odds with Economics 101 but also at odds with everything Republicans have ever said about taxes.</p><p>And on Tuesday he cranked the nonsense up to 11. Asked how he would cut grocery prices, he responded by saying that he would <a href="https://x.com/Brendan_Duke/status/1836196410233962855" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">restrict food imports</a>: “We allow a lot of farm product into our country. We’re going have to be a little like other countries. We’re not going to allow so much.”</p><p>What? This is going from trickle-down to upside-down. Even in the fever swamps of the right, it must be hard to find people who believe that you can make something cheaper by reducing its supply.</p><p>For what it’s worth, I don’t think there’s a doctrine here. What we’re looking at here is probably a brain glitch. Somebody said “food,” which activated some neurons in Trump’s brain linked to “farmers,” and he fell into his usual habit of proposing import restrictions as the answer to everything.</p><p>Still, Trump has gone on and on about high food prices, with a particular thing about bacon for some reason. You might have expected him to have some kind of idea ready when asked what he would do to bring them down.</p><p>But Trump doesn’t have ideas. He has fixations.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="17" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzg1YmRkYTA2LWQwZDctNTU4OC04MDAwLWM2MGZjYTVjYzI2Ng=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#jill-stein-green-party" data-source-id="100000009703925"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gail-collins"><img alt="Gail Collins" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/01/opinion/opcollins-headshot-2021/opcollins-headshot-2021-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/01/opinion/opcollins-headshot-2021/opcollins-headshot-2021-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/01/opinion/opcollins-headshot-2021/opcollins-headshot-2021-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-19T09:05:26.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 19, 2024, 5:05 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Young/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>OK, people, tell me when you last contemplated Jill Stein, perennial Green Party candidate for president.</p><p>“Y’all, this is a little spicy, but I have thoughts,” said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a recent Instagram post criticizing Stein’s third attempt at running for president.</p><p>Truly, “a little spicy” and “Green Party candidate Jill Stein” do not often come up in the same sentence. Or paragraph. Or train of thought.</p><p>But this is the season when we start to fret a lot about third-party presidential candidates who could divert enough cranky voters from the real options to change the outcome of the election.</p><p>We will stop now for a moment to remember the Green Party’s presidential candidate in 2000, Ralph Nader, who drained just enough support from Al Gore in Florida to tip the election to George W. Bush.</p><p>Or, um, Jill Stein. Whose presence on the ballot in a few swing states was just enough to keep Hillary Clinton from beating Donald Trump in 2016.</p><p>The danger isn’t nearly as great as it was a few months ago, when it looked like the race was going to be Biden-Trump and millions of depressed voters were wondering whether to write in the name of a close friend or, hey, George Clooney.</p><p>But still, you can never tell how things might get screwed up, particularly since any outcome not involving the election of Trump is going to lead to months of legal battles and protests.</p><p>So feel free to worry about Stein — or other presidential candidates, like Cornel West, whose only major achievement this time around has been <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4882419-cornel-west-ballot-access-pennsylvania/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not making</a> the ballot in Pennsylvania.</p><p>They’re not exactly building a movement, and as Ocasio-Cortez said, if “all you do is show up every four years,” you really ought to be doing something else. Maybe running for a less ridiculous office, the way Ocasio-Cortez did when she knocked off an entrenched and deeply unthrilling House veteran in 2018.</p><p>Or sign up for a night-school class. Clean the basement. Reread “War and Peace.” The options are endless. Get a life.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="14" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2IyYTNmMDgxLTA2YzUtNTJjMi04M2Y1LTg4OTBlZjM2N2IwMg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#stump-speech-trump-2020" data-source-id="100000009704533"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katherine-miller"><img alt="Katherine Miller" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-18T21:12:49.370Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 18, 2024, 5:12 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p><em>Each Wednesday in The Point through the election, Katherine Miller will highlight a revealing moment from a stump speech on the campaign trail.</em></p><p>In the last few weeks, the Trump campaign has tried out a town-hall format in which a friend of the campaign asks Donald Trump questions onstage, and then they also turn to a couple voters for questions. The hosts have included <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQgxK_GS-ic" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tulsi Gabbard</a> in La Crosse, Wis., last month and Gov. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2r31Kw4Xoo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sarah Huckabee Sanders</a> of Arkansas in Flint, Mich., on Tuesday night. The format is pretty watchable and the voter questions have been <a href="https://youtu.be/T3tZ05xWDBA?feature=shared&amp;t=2632" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">primarily</a> about the high cost of living, though the events have really gone a lot of places, thematically.</p><p>The clip a lot of people saw was Sanders <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2r31Kw4Xoo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying</a> that her children reminded her of what’s important and also kept her humble, and that Kamala Harris “doesn’t have anything keeping her humble” (a curveball return to the implicit criticism of people who don’t have children). This was actually the second town hall to open with children as a topic: In Gabbard’s case, she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/fQgxK_GS-ic?feature=shared&amp;t=580" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spoke</a> about her own desire and inability to have children and the importance of I.V.F.</p><p>But one small thing that also came up at Tuesday night’s event, albeit one that some people may have heard a thousand times before, was Trump’s response to a fairly anodyne question. “We’ve never needed a fighter more and we’ve never had someone more qualified to step in and lead our country than you,” Sanders <a href="https://youtu.be/T3tZ05xWDBA?feature=shared&amp;t=155" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told him</a> at the outset of the event after a discussion of the apparent second assassination attempt. “I’d love for you to tell us why you want to be president and why do you keep fighting even after they keep attacking you every single day?”</p><p>This is how that answer started:</p><blockquote><p>Yeah, so we ran — a lot of love in this room, you love me, I love you, and we love Sarah — we all ran in 2016 and it was amazing and we won. We then ran in 2020 and we did much better than 2016; people don’t like to hear it. “Oh, he’s a conspiracy theorist” — we got millions and millions more votes, we did much better, it wasn’t even a contest. I was telling one of the papers; they said, “What was the difference?” I said the difference is we did much, much better the second time. But we had a lot of things happen. We know what those things are, so what difference — because now, in like 48 days or whatever it might be, we’re going to do something that will be, I don’t think it’s going to shock the world actually, I think the world is going to be prepared already. In Europe, they want it to happen. Even though they would not prefer dealing with me in terms of the economics, they still want it to happen, because the whole world is blowing up, and they know it is not going to happen if I’m president here. So we did great, and honestly, if I didn’t do great, and we know what happened, and if that didn’t happen, if I didn’t do well in 2020, I wouldn’t even think about doing this.</p></blockquote><p>Obviously he’s said iterations of this so many times that it fades into the back of the mind. But I just read the <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/735736/trump-in-exile-by-meridith-mcgraw/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new book</a> by Politico’s Meridith McGraw on Trump’s post-presidency, and one of the takeaways is just how much the aftermath of losing the 2020 election and Jan. 6 shaped the last few years for Trump. The book details his interest in the audits of votes, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/25/politics/blake-masters-donald-trump-arizona-voter-intimidation/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his calls</a> to the 2022 Republican candidates about how they needed to emphasize his claims, his interest in defeating candidates who’d voted for his impeachment in the House to prove the point of his influence. And that aftermath shaped the people who have been around him and the way the party’s changed.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2JkM2I5Y2ViLTBjYzUtNTU1NS1hMDRkLTFlZTk1YjVmNDU1MQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#fed-rate-cut-political" data-source-id="100000009704334"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/peter-coy"><img alt="Peter Coy" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/27/opinion/author-peter-coy-2/Peter_Coy_Final-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/27/opinion/author-peter-coy-2/Peter_Coy_Final-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/27/opinion/author-peter-coy-2/Peter_Coy_Final-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-18T18:14:41.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 18, 2024, 2:14 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Was it “political” for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates less than two months before the presidential election, as Donald Trump has charged? Not a bit. Not cutting rates is what would have been political.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Fed’s rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee cut the target range for the federal funds rate — the short-term interest rate it controls — by half a percent. A cut that big was at the high end of forecasters’ predictions. More often the Fed moves a quarter-point at a time, but the committee members apparently wanted to make sure that they didn’t fall behind the curve and allow the economy to slip into a recession.</p><p>The nub of the argument that the Fed was trying to help the Democrats is that lower rates might help the economy grow a little faster, which would in principle help the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris, since her party controls the White House.</p><p>Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/business/economy/trump-interest-rates.html" title="">referred</a> to the expected rate cut as “political stuff” during a town hall in Michigan this week. Earlier this year, in an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-trump-interview-transcript/?sref=B3uFyqJT" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with Bloomberg Businessweek, he said that an interest-rate cut by the Fed is “something that they know they shouldn’t be doing.”</p><p>John Paulson, the billionaire investor who is informally advising Trump, issued a statement noting that “the Fed claims to be above politics,” but saying the timing of the rate cut “cast doubt on its claims.” He said that although interest rates are too high, the Fed should have waited until November to start cutting them.</p><p>But the arguments of Trump and Paulson don’t hold up to scrutiny. If the members of the Fed committee had really wanted to help the Democrat get elected, they would have started cutting earlier, since it takes <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2023/oct/what-are-long-variable-lags-monetary-policy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at least half a year</a>, and possibly much longer, for changes in interest rates to affect the real economy.</p><p>If anything, the Fed waited too long to start cutting. Inflation has cooled, while the unemployment rate shot up to 4.2 percent last month from 3.5 percent in July 2023.</p><p>Asked the politics question at the Fed’s news conference, Powell said, “This is my fourth presidential election at the Fed. It’s always the same.” </p><p>“Our job is to support the economy on behalf of the American people,” he said, adding, “We don’t put up any other filters. If we start to do that, I don’t know where we stop.”</p><p>Unfortunately, sometimes not being political is going to look political. Under these economic conditions, for the Fed to try to dodge criticism from Trump by leaving interest rates high would have been highly political — and indefensible.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="11" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzliOThjZGM2LTgwNjMtNWU0Yy1hN2JiLWU5NDcwODhjZDUzMg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#hezbollah-israel-pagers-assassinations" data-source-id="100000009704056"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/serge-schmemann"><img alt="Serge Schmemann" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/opinion/serge-schmemann-headshot/serge-schmemann-headshot-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/opinion/serge-schmemann-headshot/serge-schmemann-headshot-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/opinion/serge-schmemann-headshot/serge-schmemann-headshot-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-18T17:39:36.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 18, 2024, 1:39 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>We may never know all the details of how Israel got explosives into thousands of pagers, and apparently other wireless radios, that have been exploding in Lebanon, mostly in the possession of members of Hezbollah. The Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, is not in the habit of divulging information about its methods, and Israel is not likely to say anything. Yet the fusillade of exploding pagers has set a new standard — if not in ingenuity, then at least in scale.</p><p>Assassinations are as old as politics, and for most of history they were carried out by relatively straightforward means — knives or guns, with an occasional flourish. The mother of the nefarious Roman emperor Nero, for example, helped him to the throne by serving her husband Claudius a plate of poison mushrooms. (Nero then had her assassinated.)</p><p>But it is in the modern era that assassinations — now often whitewashed as “extrajudicial killings” — have become instruments of state and have harnessed cutting-edge science and inventiveness. Drones, bombs, disguised assassins and special forces are the most common killing tools, but ingenuity is still prized for the toughest targets — or as a way to send a signal.</p><p>Israel has long been among the busiest, most creative and audacious of states that practice extrajudicial killing. According to Ronen Bergman, an Israeli journalist, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine and the author of “Rise and Kill First: The Secret History of Israel’s Targeted Assassinations,” there have been about 2,700 such killings.</p><p>The pager explosions in Lebanon were not the first time Israel used a hand-held wireless device as a weapon. In January 1996, I covered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/world/palestinians-vow-vengeance-at-gaza-funeral-of-terrorist.html" title="">the funeral of Yahya Ayyash</a>, a Palestinian known as “the Engineer” for building suicide bombs used against Israelis. He was killed in Gaza when his booby-trapped mobile phone exploded. Other noteworthy techniques used by Israel involved <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2018-01-24/poisoned-toothpaste-and-exploding-phones-israel-s-proxy-for-war?embedded-checkout=true" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poisoned toothpaste</a> and a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-and-mossad-killed-senior-hezbollah-figure-in-car-bombing/2015/01/30/ebb88682-968a-11e4-8005-1924ede3e54a_story.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bomb hidden in a spare tire</a>.</p><p>One Israeli attempted hit dramatically misfired. In 1997, Mossad agents in Jordan managed to inject poison into the ear of a Hamas official, Khaled Meshal. The assassins were caught; Jordan demanded an antidote from Israel; and Meshal is today probably the top political leader of Hamas.</p><p>Dramatic hits — and certainly dramatic failures — are hardly confined to Israel. The United States tried and failed to kill Fidel Castro hundreds of times, once by an exploding cigar. The Soviet Union and Russia also launched some doozies. There was the celebrated “poison umbrella” against a Bulgarian dissident in 1978, the polonium-laced tea that Alexander Litvinenko drank in 2006, or the nerve agent used against Sergei Skripal in 2018 and Alexei Navalny in 2020 (both survived the attacks).</p><p>Still, the pager attacks open a new chapter in the gruesome history of assassinations. This time, the target was not one person but an entire organization, with the certainty that the dead and injured would not be limited to members of Hezbollah. The long-term goal, moreover, remains unclear — Hezbollah has not been crippled, and is now compelled to retaliate.</p><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Sept. 18, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated the affiliation of Khaled Meshal.

With the lurking threat of his powerful base backing him, the former president has slowly created an atmosphere in which it is commonly understood that opposing him invites retribution, in the form of online harassment,<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/29/us/politics/paul-pelosi-political-violence.html" title="">home invasions</a>, bomb threats, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/opinion/trump-documents-jan-6-prosecute.html" title="">violent insurrections</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/23/us/verdict-trial-gretchen-whitmer-kidnap.html" title="">kidnapping attempts</a>.</p><p>Where once this country might have relied on Republicans with a backbone to stand up against Trump’s worst tendencies, the threat of retribution has become so great that<strong> </strong>the former president has come close to achieving total submission within his own party.</p><p>What’s now playing out in Springfield, however, marks a more ominous shift in the MAGA faithful’s focus.<strong> </strong>Lacking noncompliant politicians to harass, Trump’s supporters have now turned outward, using threats against the town as a warning to the nation of what happens if it ignores MAGA’s racist demands — “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/14/nx-s1-5037992/trump-immigrants-border-mass-deportation-presidential-race-migrants" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mass deportation now!</a>”</p><p>It should be unsurprising that this attempt to force the culture to shift has begun just as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/01/my-president-was-black/508793/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">another Black American</a> has a real shot at this country’s highest office. A culture of white supremacy, which Trump and Vance’s racist lies clearly serve, cannot thrive if the majority of the country welcomes a multiracial democracy with open arms. So, the thinking goes, they must be intimidated with threats of violence into acceding to Trump’s will.</p><p>Harris made it clear on Tuesday that she understands — and cares about — the risks of unrestrained speech. “When you have this kind of microphone in front of you,” she said in an interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists, “you really ought to understand at a very deep level how much your words have meaning.”</p><p>Like so many politicians throughout this country’s history, she chooses to follow a personal code of morality and decency. That used to be the norm in a national political campaign, but Trump has made such behavior seem optional. In this particular election, even Harris’s bare minimum should be enough.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="8" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2I3NDc3YzNkLTRmMmEtNTRkNy05MDQxLTRhYzM2MTdkN2ViYw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#instagram-children-regulation" data-source-id="100000009699333"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zeynep-tufekci"><img alt="Zeynep Tufekci" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-17T19:56:32.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 17, 2024, 3:56 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Instagram just announced “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/technology/instagram-teens-safety-privacy-changes.html" title="">sweeping</a>” changes to how it handles minors’ accounts, a belated acknowledgment that a social platform that seeks to encourage engagement can have pernicious effects on children. Accounts whose owners self-identify as minors will now be private by default, stop notifications between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., and allow parent accounts to see who receives their children’s messages.</p><p>But these new policies will have little impact on many teenagers, because the platform has not set up age verification.</p><p>In response to Instagram’s new policy, many kids will simply create “finstas” — fake accounts — and carry on as before. Additionally, 16- and 17-year-olds will be able to opt out of these settings without needing parental approval. Anyone familiar with teenagers and the platform can see that Instagram’s new policy is less of a solution and more of a performance of doing something in response to public outcry.</p><p>Even these minor changes came only after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/technology/instagram-teens-safety-privacy-changes.html" title="">dozens of lawsuits</a> by state attorneys general and recent legislation aimed at protecting minors online that overwhelmingly passed in the Senate. In an age of polarization, such consensus is a strong indicator of how bothered the public is by all this.</p><p>While our new connected reality does have upsides, many teenagers suffer greatly from the constant judgment that characterizes social media platforms. And then there are the many documented cases of blackmail and exploitation of vulnerable youngsters.</p><p>Obviously, those best able to protect themselves from social media’s harms are going to be the young people who already have trusting relationships with their parents. Those kids are more likely to voluntarily self-identify as minors and now have slightly better default settings. But what about the rest of them?</p><p>Age verification is the kind of policy that would allow such changes to have widespread effect. But it’s not an easy fix. And it would certainly not be without major downsides, especially if it allowed a company to collect even more information on everyone. It also might overly stifle legitimate and necessary access to online information and speech. But those problems are potentially solvable in part by developing new technological approaches, if companies had the incentive to try.</p><p>So far, tech companies have little incentive to do much else besides belatedly change a few settings. Little else is likely to happen until Congress finally gets serious, resists the lobbying by these wealthy companies and puts some thoughtful effort into legislation with sharp enough teeth to force platforms to act.</p><p>Until then, the most vulnerable kids are still on their own.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzFmNGIyMjA3LTA0NDctNWQ1ZC05ZjI5LWIxYTI1NzBiYzJiNQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#supreme-court-roberts-immunity" data-source-id="100000009696787"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jesse-wegman"><img alt="Jesse Wegman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-17T09:04:06.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 17, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Jacquelyn Martin/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Does John Roberts live in the same world as the rest of us? One has to wonder, given how frequently the Supreme Court’s chief justice seems removed from the social and political realities of the country.</p><p>As revealed by my Times colleagues Jodi Kantor and Adam Liptak in their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/us/justice-roberts-trump-supreme-court.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">remarkable, deeply reported article</a> that was published on Sunday, Roberts orchestrated several high-profile rulings last term in ways that benefited Donald Trump, at least partly by acting as though the American people would not interpret them as political. In drafting the majority opinion for the Jan. 6 presidential immunity case, for example, Roberts “seemed confident that his arguments would soar above politics, persuade the public, and stand the test of time,” Kantor and Liptak wrote.</p><p>That attitude was dangerously naïve, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor tried to warn Roberts in the justices’ private conference following oral arguments in the case. The court was weighing whether to reverse a federal appeals court ruling that Trump was not immune from prosecution for his actions on and around Jan. 6. Sotomayor “did not see how the court could reverse the appellate decision. It would look like the Supreme Court was being used to delay the trial, she said,” according to the article.</p><p>She was right, of course: “Both conservatives and liberals saw it as an epic win for Mr. Trump.” Combined with the rulings in Trump’s favor in the other two Jan. 6 cases, it is no surprise that the Supreme Court’s public approval level is <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/08/08/favorable-views-of-supreme-court-remain-near-historic-low/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hovering around its all-time low</a>. You don’t need a law degree to understand that in the post-Bush v. Gore era, the court treads on extremely thin ice when it inserts itself into presidential politics, all the more so if the justices in the majority share a political ideology with the winning side.</p><p>At the same time, Roberts gives indications of being aware of the fragility of the court’s legitimacy. In one of the article’s most telling details, the chief justice took charge of writing an opinion in a case involving Jan. 6 rioters — one that had initially been assigned to Justice Samuel Alito. Roberts did so just days after The Times reported that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/us/justice-alito-upside-down-flag.html" title="">a pro-Trump flag had flown outside Alito’s home</a> around the time of the Capitol attack. Given how unusual it is for a majority opinion to change hands, the timing suggests Roberts was trying to counteract a perceived bias of at least one of the justices.</p><p>Still, masking the radical partisanship of the court’s right-most flank doesn’t fool anyone. If Roberts wants to rebuild public confidence in the court, he could start by acknowledging the real world outside One First Street. In a world as polarized as ours, you can’t issue a hugely consequential ruling that’s about Trump and pretend that it has nothing to do with Trump. The immunity ruling has already affected the operation of the presidency, and it’s natural for people to consider it in light of how Trump (or Kamala Harris, for that matter) would react to it starting in 2025. </p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2U4Njc5ZTlhLTlmYjUtNTkxZC05Y2Q5LTFmNmVjNGQ4ZWMyZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#kamala-harris-polish-voters" data-source-id="100000009694363"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jonathan-alter"><img alt="Jonathan Alter" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-16T18:59:21.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 16, 2024, 2:59 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Kamala Harris’s powerful message on abortion and Donald Trump’s deranged lies about Haitian immigrants eating pets are getting most of the post-debate attention, but Harris’s appeal to Polish American voters in Pennsylvania might prove more influential in the outcome.</p><p>One highlight of the debate came when the moderator David Muir asked Trump: “Do you believe it’s in the U.S.’s best interests for Ukraine to win this war? Yes or no?”</p><p>After Trump basically said no, Harris detailed her 2023 visit to Poland and Romania on NATO’s eastern flank and her role in the “righteous defense” of Ukraine. She explained why our NATO allies are “so thankful that you are no longer president.” If Trump had been in office then, “Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe. Starting with Poland. And why don’t you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor.” She ended by calling Putin “a dictator who would eat you for lunch.”</p><p>That was a smart line of attack for reasons beyond Pennsylvania and the Polish American vote. It appeals to veterans and to swing voters looking for a candidate who will stand up for American interests in the world. Many of these voters understand that persuading other nations to contribute more to our common defense (which Biden and Harris have done) is not our only foreign policy objective.</p><p>More broadly, the exchange over the war in Ukraine made Harris look strong and Trump weak. He came across as not just a patsy for dictators (and an autocrat who uses the Hungarian strongman, Viktor Orban, as a character reference), but clueless in claiming that he could settle a complex conflict overnight. While foreign policy is rarely a critical issue in elections during which no American soldiers are in combat, Harris’s fluency in its nuances signaled to voters that she is presidential.</p><p>It’s hard to predict how all of this will play with a bellwether constituency in a bellwether state. Polish American voters have sided with the losing candidate only three times in more than a century. A gaffe by President Gerald Ford in a debate with his challenger, Jimmy Carter, (“I don’t believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.”) helped sink Ford in the 1976 election. But an overheard ethnic slur against Poles by the vice-presidential candidate Spiro Agnew in 1968 did not cost Richard Nixon the election that year.</p><p>In Pennsylvania, Polish Americans were essential to Joe Biden’s victory over Trump there in 2020, following Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss in the state. They identified with Biden as a Scranton native and fellow Catholic, advantages that Harris does not possess.</p><p>It may be “wishful thinking,” as one Pennsylvania professor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/kamala-harris-polish-americans-pennsylvania.html" title="">told The Times</a> last week, to assume Harris can make inroads with this constituency, which cares a lot about the immigration issue. But at least Harris is trying. Attacking Trump for selling out to Putin on the future of Poland is more than just good politics. It’s a sign that she is ready to be the leader of the free world.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2MxMWU1MWExLTEyMjktNWNiMi04MDc5LWZhZWNmYjRiY2Q5ZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#parenting-costs-usa" data-source-id="100000009694103"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/pamela-paul"><img alt="Pamela Paul" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-16T16:43:02.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 16, 2024, 12:43 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Last month, the surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/08/28/us-surgeon-general-issues-advisory-mental-health-well-being-parents.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued an advisory</a> on the mental health and well-being of parents. Too many parents, Murthy noted, are stressed out by the demands of parenthood in an environment dominated by gun violence, social media and drug epidemics. Murthy recommended policies to support parental mental health, improve child care access, increase parental leave and improve community support.</p><p>That’s nice.</p><p>As for Kamala Harris, if she becomes president, she <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/issues/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wants to offer</a> $6,000 child tax credits to families with newborns and make high-quality child care more affordable.</p><p>That’s also nice.</p><p>But it’s a drop in the bucket. Across the developed world, parents are stressed over social media and their kids doing well at school. But in many European countries, parents can <em>afford</em> to stress about those things because they have access to free or heavily subsidized child care, health care and education. (These countries also have sensible gun laws, but that’s another story.)</p><p>Here in America, we get none of that. If American parents didn’t have to sweat over saving <a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2017/01/13/cost-raising-child" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> to pay for these larger things, they might have the time and mental space to attend to child-rearing’s ordinary challenges. If they didn’t have to panic over their kids’ futures being subject to these same expenses and a merciless job market, they wouldn’t be quite so frantic about their children’s education and whether it will adequately prepare them for an economically secure future.</p><p>My European friends think what American parents put up with is bonkers, but unlike many Americans, they don’t blame parents. They recognize that American parents are trapped in an impossible system.</p><p>Fifteen years ago, I wrote a book called “<a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780805089240/parentinginc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Parenting, Inc.: How the Billion-Dollar Baby Business Has Changed the Way We Raise Our Children</a>.” That book was largely about how companies exploit parents’ fears to sell them products and services intended to make their children “succeed.” That market has since metastasized, but its underlying cause remains the same. “The cost of raising children is rising far faster than our earnings,” I wrote. “That leaves even couples who make decent salaries belaboring the decision to have children based on the bottom line.” Republicans like JD Vance have <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jd-vance-child-tax-credit-5000-what-to-know/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested a similarly meager tax credit</a> in their push to get Americans reproducing. And even Democrats are too tentative to push for systemic change in health care, child care or education. The picayune proposals currently on the table amount to petty change, not to any material change at all.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzMyZjZmOGQwLWNhM2YtNTRkNS04NzNkLTEzZDFjZDkwZTc0ZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#american-voters-in-the-shadow-of-another-gunman" data-source-id="100000009693475"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-healy"><img alt="Patrick Healy" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-16T09:04:01.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 16, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p><em>Every Monday morning on The Point, we start the week with a tipsheet on the latest in the presidential campaign. Here’s what we’re looking at this week:</em></p><ul><li><p>After the Kamala Harris-Donald Trump debate last week, I held a focus group with young, undecided voters and we discussed the 2024 election.</p><p>“It feels like something out of a dystopian movie,” a 22-year-old said.</p><p>“Full of twists and turns,” one 24-year-old replied.</p><p>“A confusing whirlwind,” a 21-year-old called it.</p></li><li><p>These three voters grew up in a country and a world shaped and scarred by 9/11, the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina, Twitter, the Great Recession, Sandy Hook, a rapidly warming planet, the famines and food crises across Africa, President Donald Trump, Charlottesville, Covid, George Floyd, Jan. 6, deep fakes, Ukraine, Oct. 7, Gaza. I call these young voters the wrong-track generation: For pretty much their entire lives, a majority of Americans have said that the country was on the wrong track, and were dissatisfied with how things were going. I’m 53 and I can’t imagine growing up and, through no fault of their own, only knowing an America where so many people thought so many things were so bad.</p></li><li><p>Yesterday I was editing the transcript of this undecided voter focus group when I got an email from the Trump campaign at 2:23 p.m. saying, “President Trump is safe following gunshots in his vicinity.” I thought of those young voters who described last week’s debate as another twist and turn, as more dystopian confusion, and wondered, what will they think of America now?</p></li><li><p>Some have historical perspective, of course: we don’t live in a nation where a senator is caned in the chamber, or assassinations feel commonplace, or the KKK is marching en masse, they told me last week. In our focus groups, one thing people argue about the most is whether America’s best days are behind us or ahead of us. I find those arguments fascinating — the participants feel a deep stake in America, no matter what side they take. And yet I can’t imagine what it is to be a young person in America today, processing so much in a real-time information deluge. What I can imagine is why some young voters are still undecided. Many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/22/opinion/young-voters-focus-group.html" title="">loathe Trump and found Jan. 6 traumatic</a>; at the same time, they care a great deal about trust, and don’t confer it easily — and they don’t feel like Kamala Harris has earned their trust with the handful of big policy speeches, interviews and debates she’s done. People ask me, how can these voters be undecided? But I feel only empathy for them. Thinking about what America has given them in the last two decades, I reply, can you really blame them?</p></li><li><p>This week, these voters and the rest of us will learn more about the F.B.I.’s investigation of what may be an attempted assassination and of the suspected gunman. Trump and Harris both have <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/14/kamala-harris-to-make-blue-wall-campaign-stop-in-wisconsin-next-week/75223412007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">events</a> in which Sunday’s news — and the state of America — will get full airings, I’m sure. The lies about Haitian migrants will most likely continue, and the economy will swing back into public focus with a probable Fed interest rate cut. More twists and turns, in other words, as a lot of voters look for some meaning in it all and think about America’s best days.</p></li></ul></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzY1NTFiOTk4LTYwZTMtNWFmMC1iNjRhLWQwMjBmZDNjODRmZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/opinion/thepoint#week-bad-political-behavior" data-source-id="100000009691364"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michelle-cottle"><img alt="Michelle Cottle" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-13T21:43:15.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 13, 2024, 5:43 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p><em>With less than two months to go until Election Day, it is impossible to keep track of all the political madness afoot.

Loomer started things off by snarking on X that if Kamala Harris wins the presidency, “the White House will smell like curry &amp; White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.” Get it? Because Harris is half Indian.</p><p>The smear wasn’t clever or funny and, in fact, was so thuddingly racist it prompted a public scolding from Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (yep, you read that right: Marjorie. Taylor. Greene), who denounced Loomer’s post as “<a href="https://x.com/mtgreenee/status/1834006729966723558?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1834006729966723558%7Ctwgr%5E63d35bad8e5c15b88f98e2572ac4f97c469a826f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailybeast.com%2Fmaga-civil-war-erupts-as-laura-loomer-and-mtg-trade-blows-in-public" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appalling and extremely racist</a>” and later told CNN that Loomer lacked “<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-calls-far-right-activist-laura-loomer-s-rhetoric-huge-problem-that-doesn-t-represent-maga/ar-AA1qtqpy?ocid=BingNewsSerp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the right mentality</a>” to advise a presidential campaign. Loomer responded by slamming Greene as the real racist — and, oh, yes, also “<a href="https://twitter.com/LauraLoomer/status/1834345178460557673" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gutter trash</a>.”</p></li><li><p>But wait! There’s more. One of the Senate’s top Trump toadies, Lindsey Graham, also publicly warned his MAGA king against associating with the “toxic” Loomer, prompting Loomer <a href="https://twitter.com/LauraLoomer/status/1834305481436967305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1834305481436967305%7Ctwgr%5Eaac1537431bd7d53161ca4c898e229e4949f2b32%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rawstory.com%2Flaura-loomer-lindsey-graham%2F" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to go hard</a> at Graham, with an attack on the senator’s loyalty to Trump and on his sexual orientation.</p><p>I guess this is what happens when you build a political movement on the idea that nastiness and pugilism are signs of courage and integrity.</p></li><li><p>It looks as though Mayor Eric Adams of New York may have a Trumpian predilection for surrounding himself with questionable characters. Various aides have been swept into multiple federal investigations of possible corruption at City Hall and the Police Department. The mayor, a Democrat, has had his phone seized and his judgment questioned, since many of those under investigation were his direct appointees, including the police commissioner, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/nyregion/edward-caban-resigns-nypd-commissioner.html" title="">who resigned on Thursday</a>.</p><p>How is Adams responding to the gathering storm? By explaining to New Yorkers what’s going on or by vowing to clean up his administration? Don’t be silly. He is instead cloaking himself in the good book <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/nyregion/eric-adams-black-churches.html" title="">by comparing himself to Job</a>, the biblical innocent whose suffering was imposed by God as part of a divine test.</p><p>“I wish I could tell you that I had one moment in my life that was a Job moment,” he said at an evangelical Black church in Brooklyn on Sunday. “But I did not have one. I had many.”</p><p>Lord, deliver us from this shameless posturing.</p></li><li><p>Just when you thought Trump’s migrants-munching-pets hullabaloo couldn’t get any more delicious, up pops Marianne Williamson, the erstwhile Democratic presidential hopeful, <a href="https://twitter.com/marwilliamson/status/1834230977788313677" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">with this</a> spiritually themed warning on X:</p><p>“Continuing to dump on Trump because of the ‘eating cats’ issue will create blowback on Nov. 5. Haitian voodoo is in fact real, and to dismiss the story out-of-hand rather than listen to the citizens of Springfield, Ohio confirms in the minds of many voters the stereotype of Democrats as smug elite jerks who think they’re too smart to listen to anyone outside their own silo.”</p><p>I’m just going to leave this here for you to unpack on your own.</p></li></ul></div></div></section></div></div>
