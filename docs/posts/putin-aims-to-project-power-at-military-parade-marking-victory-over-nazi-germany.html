    <h1>Putin Aims to Project Power at Military Parade Marking Victory Over Nazi Germany</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Friday celebrated his country’s victory 80 years ago against Nazi Germany, presiding over a huge military parade in Moscow, joined by China’s top leader, Xi Jinping.</p><p>With the event, Mr. Putin was trying to project himself, along with Mr. Xi, as a leader of an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/world/europe/putin-xi-meeting-trump.html" title="">emerging alliance of anti-Western and nonaligned states</a>. The Chinese leader was sitting next to him on a stand overlooking Red Square, watching the parade. </p><p>More than 20 other international dignitaries were also attending, including President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil; Prime Minister Robert Fico of Slovakia; and President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia. Some viewed the large number of foreign leaders as a sign of Russia’s global clout despite Western efforts to isolate Mr. Putin after Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p><p>In a speech at the parade, Mr. Putin referred only briefly to the continuing war in Ukraine, saying that Russia has been engaged in a “righteous fight,” and that “the whole country, society and people support the participants of the special military operation,” using the phrase the Kremlin uses to describe the war.</p></div></div>
