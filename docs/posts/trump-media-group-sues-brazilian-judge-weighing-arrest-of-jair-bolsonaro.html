The justice is overseeing multiple criminal investigations into Mr. Bolsonaro.</p><p>The Trump Media &amp; Technology Group — which is majority owned by Mr. Trump and runs his Truth Social site — sued the Brazilian justice, Alexandre de Moraes, in U.S. federal court in Tampa on Wednesday morning. Joining as a plaintiff was Rumble, a Florida-based video platform that, like Truth Social, pitches itself as a home for free speech.</p><p>The companies accused Justice Moraes of censoring political discourse in the United States and infringing upon the First Amendment by ordering Rumble to remove the accounts of certain right-wing Brazilian pundits.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The companies argued that those orders could apply to how those accounts appeared in the United States, breaking American law. Mr. Trump’s company has not been subject to Justice Moraes’s orders, but it argued in the lawsuit that it relied on Rumble’s technology and therefore could be harmed if Rumble’s operations were affected.</p><p>Justice Moraes has argued that his actions are necessary to protect Brazil from the anti-democratic acts of Mr. Bolsonaro and his supporters. His spokeswoman said that Justice Moraes did not have immediate comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jack Nicas is the Brazil bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of much of South America.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jack-nicas">More about Jack Nicas</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
