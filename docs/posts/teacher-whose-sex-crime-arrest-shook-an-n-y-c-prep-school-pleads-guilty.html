But the second chance they offered him backfired. Nearly four years later, Mr. Nguyen, a math teacher, was arrested again, accused of preying on students. And the school, Saint Ann’s in Brooklyn, faced a roiling crisis.</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Nguyen, 38, pleaded guilty to a felony and several misdemeanors after being charged with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/nyregion/saint-anns-winston-nguyen-crime.html" title="">soliciting lewd images and videos</a> from students. When he is sentenced, most likely later this month, he faces a possible seven-year prison term.</p><p>His plea marks the latest chapter in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/nyregion/st-anns-report-winston-nguyen.html" title="">a scandal that has marred</a> the reputation of Saint Ann’s School and the administrators who hired him.</p><p>This is the second time Mr. Nguyen has been convicted of a felony. In 2019, he pleaded guilty to grand larceny and other charges after he was accused of stealing more than $300,000 from his employers, an older couple he worked for as a home health aide.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He served four months at the Rikers Island jail complex, and about a year later was hired by Saint Ann’s, a school that charges about $60,000 per year in tuition and caters to New York’s wealthy creative class. </p><p>A nattily dressed figure who arrived at class often in a suit and sometimes with a bow tie, Mr. Nguyen transformed a felony record from a liability into a résumé-builder at a school known for embracing unconventional educators. He taught a seminar called “Crime and Punishment” and quickly become a fixture at the school.</p><p>It was the kind of opportunity that few felons get.</p><p>In interviews with The New York Times last week, Mr. Nguyen tried to make sense of how he squandered it all, and how he plummeted from the promise of his youth — a driven high school student, he was once honored by the mayor of Houston, his hometown, and went on to attend Columbia University — to the reality of being a 38-year-old man headed to prison for the second time in six years.</p><p>“I’ve hurt so many people,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Nguyen declined to directly address the students he targeted — he will do so when he is sentenced, he said — but expressed remorse for the damage he caused to the school. “It was an incredibly great community to me, and I really, really regret that my actions have painted them in a horrible light,” he said.</p><p>Neither the students targeted by Mr. Nguyen nor their families have spoken publicly, and prosecutors have protected their privacy through the legal process.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Sitting in the courtyard outside his Harlem apartment, Mr. Nguyen vacillated between teary recognition of his transgressions and occasional intense bursts of self-analysis. He said he suffers from a mental illness, bipolar II disorder, which he said went untreated during the Covid-19 pandemic, and that he experienced sexual abuse as a child, but he did not make excuses for his behavior. “I very much take responsibility for my actions,” he said. “I made bad decisions.”</p><p>Mr. Nguyen was hired as an administrative aide at Saint Ann’s in the summer of 2020. He had alerted the administrator who interviewed him that he had been convicted of a felony, and at least one Saint Ann’s employee urged the school’s leaders not to hire him.</p><p>He quickly became an indispensable member of the staff, helping to manage logistics during the pandemic as he integrated himself into the school community.</p><p>The school promoted Mr. Nguyen to math teacher in the fall of 2021 but did not alert parents to his criminal record until after students discovered news stories about him on the internet. In October of 2021, Vince Tompkins, then the head of the school, sent parents an email about the new math teacher. “I can assure you that as with any teacher we hire, we are confident in Winston’s ability and fitness to educate and care for our students,” he wrote.</p><p>Within a year, students at Saint Ann’s and other Brooklyn private schools — some as young as 13 — began to receive solicitations via Snapchat for lewd photos and videos. The user behind the anonymous Snapchat accounts sent one student a graphic video of a 16-year-old boy masturbating.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>By February 2024, Saint Ann’s had been notified by the Brooklyn district attorney’s office that it was investigating the continued targeting of its students by anonymous Snapchat accounts seeking sexual photographs and videos. School administrators did not notify parents.</p><p>Days before the end of the school year, Mr. Nguyen was arrested near Saint Ann’s. He was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/nyregion/saint-anns-winston-nguyen-sexual-images.html" title="">charged in July with 11 felony counts</a>, including using a child in a sexual performance, promoting a sexual performance by a child and disseminating indecent material to a minor.</p><p>The news shocked parents and students and led to a torrent of media coverage.</p><p>In December, Saint Ann’s released the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/nyregion/st-anns-report-winston-nguyen.html" title="">findings of an investigation</a> conducted by lawyers commissioned by the school’s board to determine how the school had come to employ a felon.</p><p>The blistering report said that the school administration had “shamed” parents who expressed concern about Mr. Nguyen’s background and had suggested they were not in step with the school’s progressive values.</p><p>“In some instances,” the report said, administrators “prioritized teachers including Nguyen over the concerns of students and their families about the teacher’s background or behavior.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In the months since his arrest, Mr. Nguyen mostly has been confined to his apartment. He takes part in video therapy sessions, including group sessions with other people accused of sexual offenses, and has attended occasional church services. Otherwise, he has remained isolated, reading and watching television.</p><p>He has avoided contact with most of his friends, he said, because of his shame and desire not to burden them. At times, he said, he has been gripped by depression and stayed in bed for days.</p><p>His sister recently visited him from Houston to help him clean out his apartment as he prepares to grow into middle age in prison. She brought a load of Saint Ann’s sweatshirts and other school items from his apartment to the school, he said, but a security guard declined to take it. “I don’t deserve the family that I have,” Mr. Nguyen said.</p><p>In recent weeks he has been culling his belongings, tossing or donating most items, but for a suit, a Latin dictionary and a pair of pointe ballet slippers signed by a ballerina. While packing, he came across a warm coat given to him during a cold winter by Bernard Stoll, the man he worked for and stole from before his employment at Saint Ann’s. “People have been very, incredibly good to me, and I betrayed their trust in a very deep way,” he said.</p><p>He did not wish to stand trial, he said.</p><p>“I am at a place where I know what I’ve done,” he said. “I think part of the reason I feel so horribly is I just don’t know any way I can make it better for the kids, or for their families or for the school. I accept this sentence because I know that I did something wrong and I want to answer for it.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
