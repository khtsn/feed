The other side spent a lot of time campaigning and talking about and promising that they would leave things up to the states. Well, I’m willing to take them at their word for that.

Tim Walz, Democrat of Minnesota, addressed supporters in his state on Friday, vowing to protect Minnesota from the “most extreme elements” of a second Trump administration.</p><p>Mr. Walz, who as Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate lost the election on Tuesday, rose to national prominence as governor for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/us/politics/tim-walz-liberal.html" title="">his progressive administration</a> of Minnesota. He promoted his record in a 17-minute speech on Friday in Eagan, Minn., telling supporters that “we’re going to have to be ready to defend the progress that we made here in Minnesota.”</p><p>“The other side spent a lot of time campaigning and talking about and promising that they would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/08/us/politics/trump-abortion-states.html" title="">leave things up to the states</a>,” Walz said, referring to President-elect Donald J. Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance. “I’m willing to take them at their word for that. But the moment they try and bring a hateful agenda to this state, I’m going to stand ready to stand up and fight.”</p><p>In his remarks, Mr. Walz appeared to offer Minnesota as a liberal escape from conservative policies — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/us/politics/tim-walz-harris-vp-policies.html" title="">on abortion, immigration, guns and climate change</a>. “Minnesota always has and always will be there to provide shelter from the storm,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“As long as I’m governor of Minnesota,” Mr. Walz went on, “we’ll be a state that respects democracy, a place where we’re proud of our civic debate and where we don’t demonize people who disagree with us.”</p><p>Even as he repudiated aspects of Mr. Trump’s expected agenda, Mr. Walz also addressed the president-elect’s supporters in Minnesota and across the United States, saying that “there should be a place in our politics for everyone to be heard.”</p><p>“I think we ought to swallow — and this is me in this, as I’m speaking about myself — swallow a little bit of pride and look a little harder to find common ground with our neighbors who didn’t vote like we did in this election,” Mr. Walz said, adding, “Maybe when we get a little break from this campaign that we were in, we’ll be able to look at each other and see not enemies, but neighbors.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><svg id="election2020brand" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
