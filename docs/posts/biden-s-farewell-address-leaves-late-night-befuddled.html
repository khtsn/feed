Go get ’em, tiger!’” <em>— JORDAN KLEPPER</em></p><p>“It was more like a stern talking-to than a speech. Biden warned us about threats to democracy, including the decline of American journalism and the dangerous seeds of oligarchy, where too much power and influence is in the hands of a wealthy few. Basically, his message was, ‘I’m getting the hell out of here; you probably should, too.’” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“Yes, Biden used his last speech as president to warn us about a new American oligarchy. And you can tell the message hit home because of how many people — and this is true — how many people immediately went to Google to search ‘What is oligarchy?’ And weirdly, Google responded: ‘Don’t worry about it.’” <em>— JORDAN KLEPPER</em></p><p>“Where was this guy? Biden couldn’t sing ‘Happy Birthday,’ suddenly he pulls out ‘oligarchy’ and ‘tech industrial complex’?”<em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“Thank you, sir, for that stark warning. But I got to say, delivering it in your trademark low-power-mode whisper ramble robbed it of a certain essential urgency.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“He said, ‘Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation,’ and then I thought he was about to start rapping and I got nervous.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“I mean, I agree, but why are you giving us a to-do list on your way out?” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-411cb41f">The Punchiest Punchlines (Oligarchy Malarkey Edition)</h2><blockquote><p>“During his farewell address last night, President Joe Biden seemed sleepy and bitter as he mumbled for only 13 minutes.

Man, if only Biden were president.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“But watching this address, it was hard for me to think about anything other than the fact that in four days Donald Trump will be sleep-farting behind that very same desk with a drawer full of dipping sauces at the ready.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><blockquote><p>“Turns out, you don’t need to Google ‘oligarchy’ to understand what it looks like — just tune in to the inauguration this Monday.” <em>— JORDAN KLEPPER</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>Kate Winslet revealed her fear of cows during The Colbert Questionert on Thursday’s “Late Show.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Besides writing a memoir and an upcoming album, Neko Case is co-writing the songs for a musical adaptation of “Thelma &amp; Louise.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Meghan Marin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
