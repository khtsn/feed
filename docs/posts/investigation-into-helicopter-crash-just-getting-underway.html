    <h1>Investigation Into Helicopter Crash Just Getting Underway</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recovery crews were still searching for wreckage on Friday of a sightseeing helicopter that appeared to break apart over the Hudson River a day earlier before slamming into the water, killing all six people on board.</p><p>Among the pieces that have not been recovered as of Friday afternoon was the main rotor, according to Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board. The part was shown flying off the plunging craft in videos captured by witnesses.</p><p>Ms. Homendy cautioned, however, that the investigation was just getting underway, and would not speculate on a cause of the crash.</p><p>“Everything is on the table — we don’t rule anything out,” she said at a news conference with officials from Jersey City, near the site of the crash, on Friday afternoon. No timetable was offered for the investigation.</p></div></div>
