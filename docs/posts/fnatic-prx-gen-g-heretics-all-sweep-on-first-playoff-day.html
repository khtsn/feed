</span> ran their unique variation with Phoenix, an agent that <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/727/saadhak">
		saadhak	</a>
</span> traditionally loves to throw in as a pocket pick on maps like Ascent and now Sunset. It started great, with KC winning the pistol and converting the bonus. However, FNATIC were able to win the round after preventing a first-half snowball, and rescuing the half by only ending down 7-5.</p>

<p>Even as KC won the second pistol on Sunset, FNATIC showed the tenacity that kept them in the running at Masters Toronto. FNATIC were down 11-6, but managed a comeback to force the game to overtime thanks to both kaajak and <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/458/chronicle">
		Chronicle	</a>
</span>. It seemed like the comeback was too much for KC to handle, as FNATIC won their first two overtime rounds to end Sunset 14-12 and take the series lead.</p>

<p><em>Alfajer retakes and gets three with his Operator and Shorty.</em></p>

<p>The first map was a collapse from KC, but they had to forget it quickly to win Ascent and extend the series. With that in mind, they made a bold decision to run a composition with no Sentinel, instead opting for double Controller with Astra. FNATIC matched that with their double Sentinel with Alfajer on Chamber, and despite losing the first pistol, were able to hold out on the defense side to at least keep a 7-5 lead at the half. A strong attack side for KC, but without a Sentinel, the defense side wasn&#39;t nearly as strong in theory.</p>

<p>When FNATIC won pistol, even two rounds wins from KC did not change the strategy. Their attack took advantage of that lack of Sentinel, as both Chronicle and Alfajer stepped up to end the FNATIC attack side with 13 kills each. FNATIC closed out Ascent 13-7, sweeping Karmine Corp and eliminating them from the EWC.</p>

</span>, despite running the same composition, Paper Rex showed exactly why they won Masters Toronto by winning pistol and bonus to put all the pressure on Sentinels to bounce back immediately. Leading the way on the defense side was <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/13744/patmen">
		PatMen	</a>
</span>, who stood out on Viper to prevent post-plants from Sentinels as well as frag with 13 kills to put Paper Rex at a 9-3 lead at the half.</p>

<p>Then, on the attack side, Paper Rex once again won pistol and bonus to quickly end the map 13-3, with Jinggg leading the way with a quick 6/2/1 statline in four rounds to take the series lead.</p>

<p>That put Sentinels in need of a win on Sunset, but Paper Rex moved Jinggg back on his signature Raze. Even with more comfortable picks coming from the Sentinels team as well, including <span data-ref-id="13">

</span> on Neon, <span data-ref-id="14">

</span> on Cypher, Paper Rex used their fast pace and experience from Toronto to win pistol and take the early lead. Even with something moving to Sova, he still lead his team with 11 kills to end the first half with an 8-4 lead. </p>

<p>It was all on Sentinels to win the second pistol, and they did thanks to zekken clearing out most of A site mixed with some good utility.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0TniLzQIvrQ?si=KbnUIEihfnedcr6B&amp;clip=Ugkxl7QF4XuePoleaZFjLhID5QzW_wjK2w4Q&amp;clipt=EJ75wgMYkcrEAw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><em>zekken gets three entry kills to win Sentinels a crucial pistol round.</em></p>

<p>Sentinels were able to make a small run off of that, not converting the bonus but still winning five of the first six attack rounds, tying the game at 9-9. However, as Paper Rex took the lead once again, Jinggg used the enemy Cypher cage against them to get three kills down 4v5 and effectively end the hopes of Sentinels. Paper Rex won Sunset 13-9, completing the sweep and eliminating Sentinels from the EWC.</p>

	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9196/t3xture">
		t3xture	</a>
</span> that often ended in his favor. As Gen.G built a 7-5 lead, t3xture ended the half with 3 first kills to only one first death, as well as 14 overall kills.</p>

<p>The second half showed what looked like two entirely different teams, as Gen.G were quick to extend their lead with a pistol win and convert the bonus to take the map out of the reach of NRG. <span data-ref-id="18">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/2489/munchkin">
		Munchkin	</a>
</span> was the leader in both calls and kills on the attack side, ending the half at 10/2/1 as Gen.G quickly finished Sunset 13-6 to take the series lead and put the pressure on NRG.</p>

<p>The next map was Icebox, a map that Gen.G was comfortable on. Even after winning the pistol round, Gen.G was quick to fight back to tie the game. Then, when it came down to which team would end the first half in the lead, it was <span data-ref-id="19">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/11600/foxy9">

<p><em>Foxy9 pushes to confidently win the 2v2 against NRG.</em></p>

<p>After the half, Gen.G won the pistol but lost to a force buy from NRG to make the defending side tense. The rounds went back and forth, but with their slight lead, it favored Gen.G as they were the first team to win successive rounds to reach series point. Then, <span data-ref-id="20">

<p>The series began on Ascent, with Heretics bringing out something that the VCT has not seen since Masters Shanghai: <span data-ref-id="22">

This time, Wo0t moved to Iso as Heretics won the first pistol and stretched to a 6-0 lead. Even as the stream faced audio issues leading to no sound for viewers partway through the first half, the visuals showed nothing but Heretics rolling over and through BBL. </p>
