That’s a *great* question. I think the best writing feels like a conversation. Sometimes people can load up their sentences with too many complex vocabulary words when a much simpler word would have been a better or more direct choice. I always strive to write in a way that is inviting and that everyone can understand, and I personally think that the best writing is usually the clearest and most direct.</p></blockquote><p>And here are more of the excellent questions students have asked Times reporters.

Facilitated by our collaborating organization, <a href="http://www.vtshome.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Visual Thinking Strategies</a>, the live-moderated conversations have been running since 2012. Each week, hundreds of students from around the world join us.</p><p>Here’s how it works: On Monday mornings during the school year, you’ll find an intriguing photograph like the one above, stripped of its original caption. We ask students to think critically about what they see and post their thoughts. As students contribute ideas, our facilitators respond. Then, on Thursday afternoons, we reveal the caption and some of the back story about the photo and what it depicts.</p><p>Teachers across subject areas and levels have told us the activity is a fun way to help their students strengthen their visual and news literacy skills, support opinions with evidence, practice critical thinking, learn about other cultures and collaborate with students across the globe.</p><p>So generally useful are the skills this exercise strengthens, in fact, that, for many teachers, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/27/learning/how-to-teach-with-whats-going-on-in-this-picture.html" title="">the feature serves as a warm-up for other academic units</a> — whether for writing lab reports in science class, reading Shakespeare in English or completing an inquiry unit in history.</p><p>You can find collections of past images by scrolling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/learning-whats-going-on-in-this-picture" title="">the column</a>, or by looking through <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/learning/40-intriguing-photos-to-make-students-think.html" title="">this</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/learning/40-more-intriguing-photos-to-make-students-think.html" title="">bank</a>.</p><h3 id="link-21182f0f"><span>Read graphs and understand statistics about issues that touch teen lives.</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Teens discussed this graph with The Learning Network in 2023. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-dec-6-2023.html#commentsContainer" title="">Check out the comments</a> to see what they noticed and wondered.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Can your students read and understand information displayed in graphs and charts, whether they relate to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/31/learning/lesson-plans/teach-about-climate-change-with-30-graphs-from-the-new-york-times.html" title="">climate change</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-jan-31-2024.html" title="">college admissions</a>, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/14/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-march-27-2024.html" title="">world youth population</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-feb-15-2023.html" title="">LeBron James</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-nov-6-2024.html" title="">Taylor Swift</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-oct-30-2024.html" title="">swing voters</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/10/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-april-17-2024.html" title="">the economy</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-jan-15-2025.html" title="">the amount of time Americans spend at home</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-dec-11-2024.html" title="">Uncrustables</a>?</p><p>“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph" title="">What’s Going On in This Graph?</a>” — like its cousin, “What’s Going On in This Picture?” — is a weekly interactive exercise that is live-moderated by math educators and features three simple, open-ended questions:</p><p><em>What do you notice? What do you wonder? What’s going on in this graph?</em></p><p>On Wednesdays during the school year, students wrestle with these questions, considering what impact the data might have on them and their communities. As students post their thoughts, our partners from the <a href="https://www.amstat.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Statistical Association</a> respond in real time.

I value the range of topics (school life, politics, fun) they address. And I know whatever I find in The Times will be well written, thoroughly researched and balanced. For the writing exercises below, that means students will have models of excellent writing to follow. And for the discussion exercises, it means that, even in today’s polarized world, students can have evidence-based conversations that are timely and relevant without being contentious.</p></blockquote><p>Want to know more?

All media has bias, as charts like <a href="https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-chart" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this one</a> or <a href="https://app.adfontesmedia.com/chart/interactive" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this one</a> show, and we regularly remind students to do as <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/classroom/lesson-plans/2021/12/decoding-media-bias-lesson-plan" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this lesson plan from PBS News Hour Classroom</a> suggests and compare how different media treat the same news story. But, since the mission of The Learning Network is to help students learn with Times materials specifically, we are focusing here on our own journalism.</p><p>While The New York Times, founded in 1851, is widely recognized as the paper of record in the United States, no “<a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2010/08/on-the-trail-of-the-question-who-first-said-or-wrote-that-journalism-is-the-first-rough-draft-of-history.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first rough draft of history</a>” is without error, and sometimes the consequences of those mistakes can be momentous. For example, <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/the-centurys-bitterest-journalistic-failure-considering-times-coverage-of-the-holocaust/" title="">this lesson plan</a> focuses on how The Times and other media reported on the Holocaust in the 1930s and ’40s — coverage that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/obituaries/max-frankel-dead.html" title="">Max Frankel</a>, a former executive editor of The Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/news/150th-anniversary-1851-2001-turning-away-from-the-holocaust.html" title="">called</a> “the century’s bitterest journalistic failure.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/world/from-the-editors-the-times-and-iraq.html" title="">This 2004 piece</a>, written by a group of Times editors, analyzes problematic aspects of the paper’s coverage of news in the two years leading up to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. No matter what important 20th- or 21st-century world or national event your students are studying, they might use <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/browser" title="">TimesMachine</a> or the Times archives to analyze how the paper covered what unfolded, what the publication did well and where it may have stumbled.</p><p>But we also encourage students to think critically about Times coverage as they read today’s news. For example, as they follow reporting on the second Trump administration, students might want to read <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/insider/how-the-new-york-times-reports-on-trump.html" title="">this Insider piece</a> in which Times editors address common reader questions about how the paper covers the president. To go further, students might also consider pieces by media critics from outside The Times, such as <a href="https://margaretsullivan.substack.com/archive" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Margaret Sullivan</a>, who was once the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/public-editor/margaret-sullivan-new-york-times-public-editor.html" title="">public editor</a> for The Times and now writes for The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/margaret-sullivan" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Guardian</a> and has a <a href="https://margaretsullivan.substack.com/about" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Substack newsletter</a> focused on the question “Can journalism save democracy?” Don’t forget, too, that, via our <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/learning/students-journalists-conversations.html" title="">Conversations With Journalists activity</a>, students have the chance to pose their own questions to reporters directly, as many did in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/learning/lesson-plans/lets-discuss-covering-the-white-house.html" title="">this recent discussion with a White House correspondent</a>.</p><p>Sometimes, however, the most interesting and accessible critiques come from Times readers. In its <a href="https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014792387-The-Comments-Section" title="">commenting standards</a>, The Times explains that it “welcomes strong opinions and criticism of our work.” Students can read those by scanning the daily <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/opinion/letters" title="">Letters to the Editor</a> column, or by checking out the thousands of comments left on scores of articles and opinion pieces each day. What did they learn? What might they add if they were to join the conversation? Practicing these critical thinking skills as they read The Times will help students become more savvy consumers of all media — as well as more engaged citizens.</p><h2 id="link-76b0705c">Don’t just consume media — make your own.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-19"><div><h3 id="link-7a8e4b78"><span><strong>Use our contests to inspire your students to create.</strong></span></h3><p>Promoting student voice is a pillar of our site, and we’ve already explained how we do that in daily, low-stakes ways via our writing prompts and interactive discussions.</p><p>But it is through our <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/learning/our-2024-25-student-contest-calendar.html" title="">annual slate of contests</a> that we commit most fully to inspiring students to become creators — and to learning essential life and literacy skills along the way.

The first: Have students make some journalism of their own.</p><p>Why?</p><blockquote><p>Distinguishing false news from responsible reporting is easier when you understand the rigorous process that journalists undertake. Learning about that process teaches you the right questions to ask of what you read and see.</p></blockquote><p>To do this, his students rely on Times standards:</p><blockquote><p>To create their own news podcasts and TikTok videos, they use The New York Times’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/editorial-standards/guidelines-on-integrity.html" title="">standards and guidelines on integrity</a> as one of their models. The guidelines cover fundamentals like how journalists attribute and present quotations, confirm the veracity of their information and ensure they have reached out to all sides of a complex topic. They study how to conduct polls to assess the student body’s opinion and, through the experience, learn the limitations and pitfalls of such polling. They submit their articles to our school newspaper, and on occasions when it turns out they have gotten something wrong, they send corrections.</p><p>Later, when I have them critically analyze news items from their social media feeds, they do so with firsthand experience of the “back end” of journalism. Having now made their own media that follows journalistic best practices, the students see the gulf between the thoroughness of their work and what most other content producers create.</p><p>Unattributed quotations, polls without information about sample size, no evident attempts to present a balance of sources — these all now stand out as red flags to the students, not because I<em> </em>told them these were red flags, but because they now know from experience what legitimate journalism actually looks like.</p><p>When they actually take offense (“Hey, <em>we</em> had to do all this work — why didn’t <em>they</em>?”), I know the lessons have been successful.</p></blockquote><p>The contests we offer on our site all weave in these <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/editorial-standards/guidelines-on-integrity.html" title="">standards</a>, and, since every contest is judged, in part, by volunteers from the Times newsroom, your students’ work will be read by an “authentic audience” of people steeped in these values.</p><h3 id="link-d34a2b6"><span>Learn skills from Times journalists — and use their work as mentor texts.</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-21"><div><p>Don’t have the time or resources to participate in our contests but still want to teach students some of the related journalism skills?
