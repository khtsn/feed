The plane went off the radar and lost radio contact with air traffic control and the airline around 3:20 p.m., roughly 10 minutes before it was scheduled to arrive in Nome, he said.</p><p>A pilot and nine passengers were onboard, Mr. Olson said, adding that their names would not be immediately released. Bering Air’s Caravans can carry as many as nine passengers, according to the <a href="https://www.beringair.com/charters/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">airline</a>.</p><p>When its position was lost, the aircraft was 12 miles offshore, the U.S. Coast Guard <a href="https://x.com/USCGAlaska/status/1887733609219461274" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a statement. The plane was later reported overdue, the Alaska State Troopers <a href="https://dailydispatch.dps.alaska.gov/Home/DisplayIncident?incidentNumber=AK25011664" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>, meaning that it had not reached the airport 30 minutes past its estimated arrival time. The Federal Aviation Administration said it issued a search-and-rescue alert notice around 3:20 p.m.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Search crews and aircraft from the Coast Guard, the National Guard and the U.S. Air Force were working to locate the plane, the Nome Volunteer Fire Department <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NVFDAlaska/posts/650696787501146" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a statement.</p><p>The Nome Police Department had earlier asked members of the community with boats to assist with the search. It <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NomePD/posts/pfbid0JuYsTTmLDKZtszz57LiH5pRTAyQS72TMBAsVs9tUFsi9tqBXoKFrecaJSMofSBNdl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> later that it had received sufficient offers of help. The fire department said that the weather conditions made visibility in the area poor, warning residents not to form their own search parties.</p><p>Before the plane disappeared, its pilot told air traffic control in Anchorage that he had intended to enter a holding pattern while waiting for the runway in Nome to be cleared, according to the fire department.</p><p>Alaska’s Transportation Department said the runway at Nome Airport that the plane had been approaching had remained open throughout Thursday. Maintenance crews had de-iced the runway when no aircraft was near it, said Danielle Tessen, a spokeswoman for the department, which operates the runway.</p><p>Weather conditions in the region between Unalakleet and Nome included snow, fog and low temperatures, she added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><a href="https://www.alaskaasp.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">More than 80 percent</a> of communities in Alaska are inaccessible by road, according to the Transportation Department. Air connections, especially those provided by regional carriers like Bering Air, are essential for getting supplies like fuel and food.</p><p>Bering Air is based in Nome, with hubs in Kotzebue and Unalakleet, and operates flights to 32 more communities, according to <a href="https://www.beringair.com/about/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its website</a>. Nome is home to about 3,500 people, and Unalakleet about 800.</p><p>The National Transportation Safety Board said in a statement that it was monitoring the situation. The Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-yoon">More about John Yoon</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
