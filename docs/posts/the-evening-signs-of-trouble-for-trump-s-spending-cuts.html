Trump has pledged to preserve entitlement programs, and Republicans are loath to slash military spending. That leaves little space to scale back the biggest drivers of the debt. </p><p>Even as lawmakers talk about spending cuts and deficit reduction, they are preparing an expansion of the 2017 tax cuts that could cost the nation more than $4 trillion over a decade. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dakota Santiago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-53c08dc5">American Airlines briefly grounded all U.S. flights </h2><p>On one of the busiest travel days of the year, American Airlines grounded all its flights in the U.S. this morning for about an hour.

Like many campus protest movements, the student government takeover made little headway.

We still have the original cutout, though it is very brittle! This year, to surprise my mom, I made each of us a cutting board with an image from the magazine of the original recipe for the butter cookies. My daughter is the fifth generation to participate in this very special tradition. — <em>Lindsey Walters, Mishawaka, Ind.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Tell us about your New Year’s resolutions</strong>: As we wrap up 2024, we’re asking readers about their most successful resolutions, the ones that changed their lives for the better.
