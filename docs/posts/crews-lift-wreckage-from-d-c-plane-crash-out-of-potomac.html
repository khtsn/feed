    <h1>Crews Lift Wreckage From D.C. Plane Crash Out of Potomac</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Salvage crews lifted the first wreckage of American Airlines Flight 5342 from the Potomac River on Monday, the start of an operation that was expected to take three days.</p><p>The salvage work, which began at first light, will help investigators search for clues and will give divers room to recover the last bodies of the 67 people who died in the crash over Washington between the jet and a U.S. Army helicopter.</p><p>The first piece of wreckage surfaced just after 10 a.m. Eastern, when a red crane, perched on a barge in the middle of the river, slowly hoisted what appeared to be one of the plane’s engines out of the water. Its casing appeared to hang loose on one side and was partly missing on the other.</p><p>At noon, a larger, more mangled piece of wreckage was removed from the river. It appeared to be from the plane’s main body, including windows, the registration number and an American flag decal on the outside. Fragments of the wreckage hung down from the crane and fluttered in the wind. As the crane moved, the plane’s destroyed interior became visible from the riverbank.</p></div></div>
