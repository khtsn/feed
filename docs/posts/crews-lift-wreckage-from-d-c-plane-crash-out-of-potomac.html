Its casing appeared to hang loose on one side and was partly missing on the other.</p><p>At noon, a larger, more mangled piece of wreckage was removed from the river. It appeared to be from the plane’s main body, including windows, the registration number and an American flag decal on the outside. Fragments of the wreckage hung down from the crane and fluttered in the wind. As the crane moved, the plane’s destroyed interior became visible from the riverbank.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>By Monday afternoon, both pieces of wreckage rested on barges. They will eventually be transferred to a flatbed trailer on shore and taken to a hangar, to be studied as part of the investigation into the crash, according to officials.</p><p>Nearby, planes roared as they took off from a runway at Ronald Reagan National Airport.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A crane lifting an engine from a body of water." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg-jumbo-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg-superJumbo-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1042w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/c4426fdd-698a-57f3-a159-4d65945fc879" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Al Drago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Officials said on Sunday afternoon that the remains of 55 victims had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/us/dc-plane-crash-washington-helicopter.html" title="">recovered</a>, and that the salvage work on Monday might reveal the bodies of some of the 12 who were still missing, as crews searched the cold and murky water.</p><p>The collision was the deadliest plane crash in the United States in two decades.
