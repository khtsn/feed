Its casing appeared to hang loose on one side and was partly missing on the other.</p><p>At noon, a larger, more mangled piece of wreckage was removed from the river. It came from the plane’s main body and appeared to include windows, the registration number and an American flag decal on the outside. Fragments of the wreckage hung down from the crane and fluttered in the wind. As the crane moved, the plane’s destroyed interior became visible from the riverbank.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>By Monday afternoon, both pieces of wreckage were resting on barges. They will eventually be transferred to a flatbed trailer on shore and taken to a hangar, to be studied as part of the investigation into the crash, according to officials. Nearby, planes roared as they took off from an airport runway.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A crane lifting an engine from a body of water." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg-jumbo-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg/03xp-fuselage2-fbkg-superJumbo-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1042w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/c4426fdd-698a-57f3-a159-4d65945fc879" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Col.
