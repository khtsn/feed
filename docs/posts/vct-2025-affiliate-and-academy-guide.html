		<p>Last year, Riot announced the introduction of affiliate partnerships regionally, allowing for Challengers and Game Changers teams to unlock benefits such as Two-Way Players with VCT-partnered teams.</p>

<p>Nearly a year later, a multitude of teams have taken advantage of not just affiliate partnerships, but have also eyed the academy team system as well. Teams that field academy teams may participate in Challengers without fear of relegation in their first year, but cannot compete in VCT Ascension.</p>

<p>The following lists teams in a regional order as well as their affiliate and academy teams prior to the commencement of the VCT 2025 season:</p>

















<p>Many partnered organizations have hinted at interest in both Affiliate and Academy teams, but have yet to officialize any moves of the sort. More partnerships and academy programs can be expected later on in the year.</p>

<p>The 2025 season looms ever so closer, with China&#39;s Kickoff commencing in less than a day. Fans can expect new looks and plays from each and every team this year.</p>
