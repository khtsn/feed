In a <a href="https://x.com/alarabiya/status/1867161079408726384?s=46" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> aired on Thursday by the news channel Al Arabiya, someone is heard asking the man if his name is Travis Timmerman. The man says, “That’s right.” </p><p>Hisham al-Eid, the mayor of Al-Thihabiyeh, a poor, partly rural town east of Damascus, said that the man had been found on Thursday morning on a main road. He was barefoot and cold but otherwise seemed to be in good health, Mr. al-Eid said.</p><p>The man <a href="https://x.com/AlArabiya_Eng/status/1867169140966109328" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told reporters</a> that he had entered Syria from Lebanon on a Christian pilgrimage, and had been detained for several months. He said he had received food and water while in detention, and was allowed to go to the bathroom three times a day.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In another <a href="https://x.com/AlArabiya/status/1867165531251372528" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> posted by Al Arabiya, the man, wearing a beard and a gray hooded top, said that he had been held in a cell alone. When asked how he was freed, he said that on Monday, someone “took a hammer and they broke my door down.”</p><p>It was not immediately clear where the man had been held. The fall of the authoritarian Assad regime over the weekend to rebel forces led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has prompted the release of many prisoners held in a sprawling network of detention centers operated by the former government.</p><p>This year, the <a href="https://www.mshp.dps.missouri.gov/MSHPWeb/mpphotos/A1001001A24I19B14036B567661.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Missouri State Highway Patrol</a> put out a missing persons flyer for Pete Timmerman, 29, saying he had last been located in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, on May 28. In August, the Hungarian police <a href="https://www.police.hu/hu/hirek-es-informaciok/legfrissebb-hireink/felhivasok/eltunes-miatt-keressuk-travis-pete-timmermant" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">put out a call</a> looking for “Travis Pete Timmerman” and shared photos of a man who resembles the one in the Al Arabiya interview.</p><p>The man <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/travis-timmerman-syria-american-man-found-freed-prison-assad-ouster/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told CBS News</a> on Thursday that he had been in contact with his family three weeks ago, using a phone that he had while he was in prison. He said that he had left the prison where he had been held with a large group of people and that he had been trying to get to Jordan. It was unclear how he had arrived in the town where he was found.</p><p>Asked by reporters whether he had processed his newfound freedom, he said, “I still haven’t really thought about that,” CBS reported. “I’ve been more worried about finding a place to sleep each night since then.”</p><p>Lynsey Chutel<!-- -->, <!-- -->Andrew Higgins<!-- -->, <!-- -->Ismaeel Naar<!-- --> and Barnabas Heincz contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Syria’s Civil War: News and Analysis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Search for the Disappeared:</strong> Syrians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/middleeast/syria-prisoners-dead.html">raced to newly emptied prisons</a> to reunite with loved ones taken away by Bashar al-Assad’s regime, but their quest sometimes took them to the morgue.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Mood in Aleppo:</strong> Rebel fighters who breached the city in late November have promised security and continuity.
