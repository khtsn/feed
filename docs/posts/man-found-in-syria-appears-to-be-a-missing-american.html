    <h1>Man Found in Syria Appears to Be a Missing American</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In another <a href="https://x.com/AlArabiya/status/1867165531251372528" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> posted by Al Arabiya, the man, wearing a beard and a gray hooded top, said that he had been held in a cell alone. When asked how he was freed, he said that on Monday, someone “took a hammer and they broke my door down.”</p><p>It was not immediately clear where the man had been held. The fall of the authoritarian Assad regime over the weekend to rebel forces led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has prompted the release of many prisoners held in a sprawling network of detention centers operated by the former government.</p><p>This year, the <a href="https://www.mshp.dps.missouri.gov/MSHPWeb/mpphotos/A1001001A24I19B14036B567661.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Missouri State Highway Patrol</a> put out a missing persons flyer for Pete Timmerman, 29, saying he had last been located in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, on May 28. In August, the Hungarian police <a href="https://www.police.hu/hu/hirek-es-informaciok/legfrissebb-hireink/felhivasok/eltunes-miatt-keressuk-travis-pete-timmermant" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">put out a call</a> looking for “Travis Pete Timmerman” and shared photos of a man who resembles the one in the Al Arabiya interview.</p><p>The man <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/travis-timmerman-syria-american-man-found-freed-prison-assad-ouster/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told CBS News</a> on Thursday that he had been in contact with his family three weeks ago, using a phone that he had while he was in prison. He said that he had left the prison where he had been held with a large group of people and that he had been trying to get to Jordan. It was unclear how he had arrived in the town where he was found.</p><p>Asked by reporters whether he had processed his newfound freedom, he said, “I still haven’t really thought about that,” CBS reported. “I’ve been more worried about finding a place to sleep each night since then.”</p><p>Lynsey Chutel<!-- -->, <!-- -->Andrew Higgins<!-- -->, <!-- -->Ismaeel Naar<!-- --> and Barnabas Heincz contributed reporting.</p></div></div>
