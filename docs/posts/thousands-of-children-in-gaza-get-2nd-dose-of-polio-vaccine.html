Since then, the Israeli military has launched an intense offensive in the area against what it has said is a resurgence of Hamas.</p><p>A humanitarian pause for the second and final phase of the vaccination campaign was only assured for Gaza City, according to the U.N. agencies. They said that around 15,000 children under 10 in northern towns where the Israeli military has been carrying out the offensive over the last few weeks “remain inaccessible and will be missed during the campaign, compromising its effectiveness.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The Gazan Health Ministry said that as of Saturday, 437,774 children under 10 had received the second dose of the vaccine across the whole Gaza Strip.

Col. Nadav Shoshani, <a href="https://x.com/LTC_Shoshani/status/1852819910893646299" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">replied</a> to that post on X, saying that an initial review by the military showed it had not struck in that area at that time.</p><p>UNICEF, the U.N. children’s agency, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/statement-unicef-executive-director-catherine-russell-deadly-weekend-attacks-north" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> separately that the vehicle of one of its staff members who was working on the polio campaign “came under fire by what we believe to be a quadcopter” while driving in northern Gaza on Saturday. The agency said that although the staff member was not injured, the attack illustrated the “grave consequences of the indiscriminate strikes on civilians in the Gaza Strip.” The Israeli military said it would need further details to assess the incident.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Aid agencies sought to start a vaccination campaign in Gaza after traces of poliovirus were found in local wastewater in July, and a 10-month-old boy was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/world/middleeast/gaza-polio-vaccine.html" title="">confirmed in August</a> to be the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/world/middleeast/gaza-polio-crisis.html" title="">first resident of Gaza</a> to be paralyzed by poliovirus in 25 years.</p><p>In September, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/world/middleeast/gaza-polio-crisis.html" title="">temporary pauses in the war</a> agreed to by Israel and Hamas allowed aid workers to immunize about 640,000 children under 10 who were at risk of the disease. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/world/middleeast/gaza-polio-vaccine.html" title="">The campaign began</a> in central Gaza, then moved to the south and ended in the northern area.</p><p>Stéphane Dujarric, the spokesman for the United Nations secretary-general, on Friday <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/ossg/noon-briefing-highlight" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described</a> the situation in parts of north Gaza as “apocalyptic.” He said that “virtually all incoming supplies and humanitarian services have ceased,” because of the siege imposed by Israeli forces. </p><p>The situation in northern Gaza, where children were deprived of receiving their second dose of the vaccine, remained dire on Sunday as Israeli forces pressed on with a weekslong offensive in three major areas. The Israeli military said its troops killed dozens of militants in Jabaliya, one of the hardest-hit areas in the north.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mahmoud Basal, a spokesman for the Palestinian civil defense, said in a statement that their work and other medical services have been halted in northern Gaza, and that they “have not been allowed to resume rescue and recovery operations.” He added that more than 100,000 people were trapped in northern Gaza “without food, water, or medicine” and were in “dire need of life-sustaining resources.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A young Palestinian man transports containers filled with clean water amid the devastation in Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In a statement Sunday to aid groups and the U.N., the Gazan health ministry warned of what it called an ongoing “fierce attack” by Israeli forces on northern Gaza “and the tightening of the siege” on the area and its hospitals.</p><p>The Israeli military denied that it was not allowing aid into northern Gaza, and said in response that its forces have been operating to dismantle Hamas infrastructure. “Given the increased flow of humanitarian aid and goods into northern Gaza in recent months, food stocks are available in various warehouses throughout northern Gaza,” the military said.</p><p>Here’s what else is happening in the Middle East:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Suspected security breach: </strong>Israeli authorities are investigating a potential high-level security breach that may have hampered previous attempts to reach a cease-fire agreement, and on Sunday a court released the name of a person suspected of involvement. The case revolves around the leaking, manipulation and potential fabrication of intelligence information published by international news media. The suspect recently worked as a spokesman in the office of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the purported intelligence he was accused of sharing seemed to lend credence to Mr. Netanyahu’s reasoning for rejecting a cease-fire in Gaza in early September. At the time, there was intense pressure from the Israeli public to close a deal with Hamas to release the hostages and end the fighting in the enclave.</p></li><li><p><strong>Syrian detained:</strong> Israel’s military said on Sunday that it had detained a Syrian citizen working with Iran in an operation in Syria conducted in “recent months.” Ali Soleiman al-Assi, who the Israeli military said had been “transferred for interrogation” in Israel, was working as an “Iranian terror network operative” and his detention had prevented a “future attack,” the military said. On Sunday, Israel’s prime minister, Mr. Netanyahu, speaking from Israel’s northern border about Hezbollah in Lebanon, said “cutting Hezbollah’s oxygen line from Iran via Syria” was key to Israel’s security.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hezbollah rockets:</strong> About 100 rockets fired from Lebanon crossed into northern Israel on Sunday, the Israeli military said. Some had been intercepted while others fell in open areas, the military noted. Hezbollah began firing on Israel last year in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. Israeli ground troops invaded southern Lebanon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-ground-invasion.html" title="">around a month ago</a>, part of a campaign to cripple Hezbollah’s forces and infrastructure in the area.</p></li><li><p><strong>Eastern Lebanon:</strong> Israel’s military warned people to move away from several buildings in the Baalbek area of eastern Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley on Sunday, saying it would target the buildings in the coming hours because they were used by Hezbollah. Lebanon’s Ministry of Health said that two hospitals were damaged by Israeli strikes on Sunday, one of them severely. The World Health Organization in Lebanon on Sunday said that continued <a href="https://x.com/WHOLebanon/status/1853144311057072234" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attacks on health facilities</a> in the country were “leading to a decline in availability and accessibility of lifesaving health services.”</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. bombers:</strong> The Pentagon has repositioned B-52 Stratofortress bombers from the Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota closer to the Middle East, according to the United States Central Command. It did not say <a href="https://x.com/CENTCOM/status/1852847593153294451" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">how many bombers</a> had been moved, or where they are stationed, but the deployment is consistent with U.S. efforts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/world/middleeast/iran-threatens-retaliation-israel-strikes.html" title="">deter Iran</a> from launching a retaliatory attack on Israel.</p></li></ul><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg<!-- --> and <!-- -->Ephrat Livni<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hiba Yazbek covers the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with a focus on Palestinian affairs and society in the Gaza Strip, the occupied West Bank and Israel.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hiba-yazbek">More about Hiba Yazbek</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
