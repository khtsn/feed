They performed in nightclubs and on television; both individually and together, they acted on television, in films and onstage.</p><p>But that single appearance remained an indelible memory for the couple: It was also the night the Beatles made their American TV debut, and that was all that the screaming young fans in the audience cared about. <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6egp4h" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Their nearly three-and-a-half minutes in the national spotlight</a> came moments before the Beatles returned for their second set. They bombed — in front of 73 million viewers.</p><p>“We just about wanted to kill ourselves,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2004/02/06/squashed-by-the-beatles/64519b89-2db9-4799-b24f-9a96c24a4e2f/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ms. McCall told The Washington Post in 2004</a>.</p><p>“I think it’s hysterical,” Mr. Brill said in a phone interview. “We laid the biggest egg of all time.”</p><p>Ms. McCall died on Aug. 8 in a hospital in Burbank, Calif. She was 93. Her death was confirmed by Mr. Brill.</p></div></div><div><p>When their manager, Mace Neufeld, told Ms. McCall and Mr. Brill that they were going to appear on “The Ed Sullivan Show” — a Sunday night staple that at the time was often a steppingstone to stardom — it seemed like the type of break a young act needed. And when Mr. Neufeld told them that they would be on the bill with the Beatles, Ms. McCall later recalled, “We weren’t really sure who they were.”</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. McCall and Mr. Brill in a 1967 publicity photo.

Instead, he had them run through their entire nightclub act and plucked parts that he thought would be suitable, creating an awkward jumble.</p><p>While they were rewriting their sketch, a young man with long hair and glasses popped into their dressing room and borrowed a dime to buy a Coke from the vending machine. He hung around and sketched the couple with a pen on a napkin.</p><p>“All we thought about was, I wish this kid would go so we can work on our act,” Ms. McCall said in a 2015 <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/568/human-spectacle/act-three-6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">episode of the public radio program “This American Life,”</a> recalling their encounter with John Lennon. “Get out of here.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>After the Beatles’ first set, the mix of entertainers was as varied as it always was on the Sullivan show: Fred Kaps, a Dutch magician; the cast of the Broadway musical “Oliver!” (which included a then-unknown Davy Jones, soon to be a member of the Monkees); the impressionist Frank Gorshin; the music-hall singer and actress Tessie O’Shea; and, finally, McCall &amp; Brill.</p><p>By then, the audience had been waiting a half-hour for the Beatles to return.</p><p>In their sketch, Mr. Brill played a producer casting a young actress for a new movie. Ms. McCall played his secretary and three other roles: a nervous former Miss Palm Springs, a pushy stage mother and a Method actor. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQoxYgIy6G4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The sketch fell with a thud</a>, except for some chuckles when Ms. McCall tossed in an ad lib as the stage mother.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. McCall and Mr. Brill made their “Ed Sullivan Show” debut on Feb. 9, 1964.

After a commercial for Pillsbury cake mix, the Beatles returned.</p><p>Ms. McCall and Mr. Brill went to Miami to visit Mr. Brill’s grandparents rather than return home to Los Angeles.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Their agent did not call them for six months. But their career eventually recovered.</p><p>Mitzi Joan Steiner was born on Sept. 9, 1930, in Pittsburgh. Her father, Emil, was a top manager at a convertible sofa store, and her mother, Gizella (Klein) Steiner, ran the household.</p><p>Mitzi started acting at a young age and had roles at the Pittsburgh Playhouse starting in the late 1940s. In the early ’50s, she hosted a television show, “Kiddie Castle,” on which she lip-synced to records by singers like Ethel Merman and Carol Channing.</p><p>“She stands, if you can call it that, four feet eleven inches, and loves kids because ‘nobody understood me as a kid,’” Win Fanning, the radio and TV editor of The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, wrote in 1952.</p><p>In 1953 she moved with her first husband, Jack Tolen, a television director, to San Diego, where she was featured on a television variety show, “Studio 10.” She soon found a Hollywood agent — with help from a friend of her mother’s, Dolores Hope, Bob’s wife — and signed a contract with Paramount Pictures. Her first role was a teenager in Norman Taurog’s “You’re Never Too Young” (1955), which starred Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. McCall and Jerry Lewis in “You’re Never Too Young” (1955).

She formed a comedy act with Joan Shawlee (who had portrayed the bandleader Sweet Sue in “Some Like It Hot”) before teaming up with Mr. Brill. They married in 1960.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“Mitzi did some bits and exercises,” Mr. Brill said, recalling his early impressions of her. “She was so funny and so adorable. The cutest in the world.”</p><p>They performed their act — which Mr. Brill said was influenced by the comedy of Mike Nichols and Elaine May — until the mid-1980s, opening for Ann-Margret, Ella Fitzgerald and Marlene Dietrich. They had a recurring role as the bickering “Fun Couple” on “Rowan &amp; Martin’s Laugh-In”; appeared on many variety and talk shows, and on game shows like “Tattletales”; and portrayed a detective and his fun-loving wife on the crime drama <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101198/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Silk Stalkings”</a> in the 1990s.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. McCall and Mr. Brill at a “Star Trek” convention in Las Vegas in 2011.
