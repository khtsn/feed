The S&amp;P 500 dropped 2.7 percent, its worst single-day decline of the year. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 4 percent, fueled in part by sharp drops in the stock prices of some of the U.S.’s most valuable companies — like Tesla, which fell by more than 15 percent.</p><p>By most measures, the U.S. economy is still in good shape. But as stocks have recoiled over the past three weeks, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/business/stock-market-economy-tariffs-recession.html" title="">many economists’ predictions have turned gloomier</a>.</p><p>Analysts we spoke to said the economic angst was in part a result of the uncertainty around tariffs. Over the last few weeks, President Trump has threatened, imposed, suspended and resumed levies on America’s three largest trade partners. Today, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/business/china-tariffs-us.html" title="">retaliatory tariffs by China on U.S. agricultural products</a> came into effect. And later this week, the Trump administration is set to put in place a 25 percent tariff on all U.S. steel and aluminum imports.</p><p>When Trump was asked this weekend about an economic slowdown, he acknowledged that there could be “a period of transition.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/us/politics/trump-recession-lutnick.html" title="">He declined to rule out the possibility of a recession</a>, and instead insisted that, in the long run, his policies would bring “wealth back to America.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><strong>One economic bright spot: </strong>Restaurants are having <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/dining/restaurants-winter-business.html" title="">an unexpectedly good winter</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Secretary of State Marco Rubio, today, on a plane headed for Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Saul Loeb</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-740362c4">Rubio said Ukraine must cede territory in exchange for peace</h2><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio said today that Ukraine would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/rubio-ukraine-russia.html" title="">have to concede some of the land that Russia had taken since 2014</a> as part of any agreement to end the war. As he flew to Saudi Arabia for talks with senior Ukrainian officials, Rubio told reporters, “The most important thing that we have to leave here with is a strong sense that Ukraine is prepared to do difficult things.”</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/zelensky-saudi-arabia-prince-ukraine-meeting.html" title="">also traveled to Saudi Arabia today</a> to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has emerged as a mediator of sorts between Ukraine and Russia.
