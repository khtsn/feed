    <h1>A Bad Day on Wall Street</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The American stock market tumbled today to its lowest point in several months. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 2.7 percent, its worst single-day decline of the year. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 4 percent, fueled in part by sharp drops in the stock prices of some of the U.S.’s most valuable companies — like Tesla, which fell by more than 15 percent.</p><p>By most measures, the U.S. economy is still in good shape. But as stocks have recoiled over the past three weeks, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/business/stock-market-economy-tariffs-recession.html" title="">many economists’ predictions have turned gloomier</a>.</p><p>Analysts we spoke to said the economic angst was in part a result of the uncertainty around tariffs. Over the last few weeks, President Trump has threatened, imposed, suspended and resumed levies on America’s three largest trade partners. Today, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/business/china-tariffs-us.html" title="">retaliatory tariffs by China on U.S. agricultural products</a> came into effect. And later this week, the Trump administration is set to put in place a 25 percent tariff on all U.S. steel and aluminum imports.</p><p>When Trump was asked this weekend about an economic slowdown, he acknowledged that there could be “a period of transition.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/us/politics/trump-recession-lutnick.html" title="">He declined to rule out the possibility of a recession</a>, and instead insisted that, in the long run, his policies would bring “wealth back to America.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Secretary of State Marco Rubio, today, on a plane headed for Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Saul Loeb</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-740362c4">Rubio said Ukraine must cede territory in exchange for peace</h2><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio said today that Ukraine would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/rubio-ukraine-russia.html" title="">have to concede some of the land that Russia had taken since 2014</a> as part of any agreement to end the war. As he flew to Saudi Arabia for talks with senior Ukrainian officials, Rubio told reporters, “The most important thing that we have to leave here with is a strong sense that Ukraine is prepared to do difficult things.”</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/zelensky-saudi-arabia-prince-ukraine-meeting.html" title="">also traveled to Saudi Arabia today</a> to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has emerged as a mediator of sorts between Ukraine and Russia. Zelensky said he did not plan on attending a meeting tomorrow with Rubio.</p><p><strong>On the ground, </strong>Ukrainian forces have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/world/europe/ukraine-russia-eastern-front-line.html" title="">stalled the Russian offensive</a> and started to win back small patches of land, according to Ukrainian soldiers and military analysts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mahmoud Khalil at a protest in New York City last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Marco Postigo Storel for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-264dad8f">The U.S. sought to expel a pro-Palestinian activist</h2><p>Federal immigration authorities detained Mahmoud Khalil, who was a prominent pro-Palestinian activist at Columbia University, over the weekend and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/nyregion/mahmoud-khalil-ice-louisiana.html" title="">transferred him to a processing center in Louisiana</a>.</p><p>Khalil is a lawful permanent resident with a green card. However, the Trump administration is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/trump-rubio-khalil-columbia-student-protests.html" title="">seeking to deport him using an obscure legal statute</a>. Their rationale is that Khalil led antisemitic protests against Israel, which they say fostered a hostile environment for Jewish students and made him — under the Immigration and Nationality Act — deportable.</p><p><strong>In related higher education news, </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/harvard-hiring-freeze-funding-trump.html" title="">Harvard announced a hiring freeze</a> after Trump threatened to pull its federal funding.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mark Carney, who now leads Canada’s Liberals.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cole Burston for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-262a651c">Canada is getting a new leader. Here’s what to know.</h2><p>Mark Carney, a former central banker, will soon be Canada’s prime minister — ending Justin Trudeau’s decade-long tenure as the country’s leader. Carney <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/world/canada/canada-election-takeaways.html" title="">dominated the Liberal Party’s leadership race over the weekend</a>, securing a victory at a moment when Canada is facing threats to its economy and sovereignty from the U.S.</p><p>Carney will soon call a general election, because his party does not command a majority in Parliament. Just a few months ago, the Conservative Party had a double-digit lead in the polls over the Liberals. Now, thanks in part to Trump’s attacks, Carney may hold on to power.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arturo Holmes/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-110aa5dc">Lady Gaga wants us to party like its 2009</h2><p>For the last 15 years, Lady Gaga proved herself to be one of music’s great shape-shifters. She’s infused pop music with dance, rock and country, all the while starring in a few blockbuster movies. Her new album, “Mayhem,” shifts back to the over-the-top excess that first made her famous.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Gaga doesn’t sound like most of her pop-music peers, who in recent years have become quieter, breathier and more restrained. “In a world of so-called lowercase pop, Gaga still has the caps-lock on in a bold, 96-point font, like she did in 2009,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/arts/music/lady-gaga-mayhem-review.html" title="">our critic Lindsay Zoladz wrote in a review</a> of the album. “Sometimes there’s a benefit to sounding a little behind the times.”</p><p><strong>For more: </strong>In an interview, Gaga talked to us about her latest experiment: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/magazine/lady-gaga-interview.html" title="">happiness</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">M.

When we think we know what a dog’s body language indicates about its emotions, we’re <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/science/dogs-pets-emotions.html" title="">more often being swayed by situational cues</a>, the paper suggested.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bell Labs was the first office building with a mirrored glass exterior.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Clark Hodgin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Armando Rafael for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-31"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><h2 id="link-65dc62ae">For these actors, learning the lines is the easy part</h2><p>At a theater in Manhattan, large bare-chested men wrestle, slap and toss one another on a stage transformed to look like a sumo ring. The choreographed fight sequences, which are the centerpiece of the new Off Broadway play “Sumo,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/theater/sumo-wrestlng-play.html" title="">required months of physical training</a>.</p><p>Two fighting directors helped coach the cast through lower-body exercises that mimic sumo wrestlers’ stances. Some of the actors also gained weight to prepare for the roles: “I think it’s helped me feel more like I inhabit the role and that I’m living that lifestyle,” one said.</p><p>Have an athletic evening.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Thanks for reading.
