    <h1>Firefighters Battle Growing Blaze Near U.S.-Mexico Border</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A fire spreading through the wilderness of San Diego County near the U.S.-Mexico border exploded to more than 500 acres within several hours on Thursday night. But the blaze, known as the Border 2 fire, was miles from any structures or homes, and firefighters said they were making progress controlling it.</p><p>Firefighters were dispatched to the area just before 2 p.m. local time and were trying to slow its spread with the help of air tankers and helicopters, said Capt. Robert Johnson of Cal Fire, the stateâ€™s fire agency. Roughly 200 firefighters were going to work through the night, he added.</p><p>The fire was burning through the Otay Mountain Wilderness, a remote area with steep and rocky terrain, Captain Johnson said. That makes it harder to access on the ground, he said, but also provides a much-needed buffer between the flames and populated areas.</p><p>Still, officials in Chula Vista, a city roughly five miles west of the blaze, said their Fire and Police Departments were monitoring the fire as some residents anxiously watched the orange glow and smoke billowing in the distance.</p></div></div>
