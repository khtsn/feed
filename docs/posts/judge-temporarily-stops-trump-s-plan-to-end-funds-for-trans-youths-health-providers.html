    <h1>Judge Temporarily Stops Trump’s Plan to End Funds for Trans Youths’ Health Providers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One order directs federal agencies to ensure that grant funding for research or education does not support “gender ideology,” which it defines as the idea that “males can identify as, and thus become women and vice versa.” The second order specifically directs agencies to withhold funds from medical providers who offer puberty blockers, hormone therapies and surgeries to people younger than 19 for the purpose of gender transition.</p><p>After Mr. Trump issued that order, the lawsuit says, several clinics <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/nyregion/nyc-transgender-care-executive-order.html" title="">canceled appointments</a>. The plaintiffs noted a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/president-trump-is-delivering-on-his-commitment-to-protect-our-kids/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">White House news release</a> from earlier this month, which stated that the order is “already having its intended effect,” and cited several announcements from hospitals.</p><p>The lawsuit names as defendants officials at the Department of Health and Human Services and several agencies that provide medical research and education grants, including the National Institutes of Health, the Health Resources and Services Administration and the National Science Foundation. The individual plaintiffs are not named in court filings, and they are described using pseudonyms.</p><p>In court documents, plaintiffs and their families said they feared negative effects, including anxiety, depression and unwanted physical changes, if treatment is withheld. A 14-year-old who lives in Maryland, known in the lawsuit as Gabe Goe, had planned to start hormone therapy in late January, court documents say, but his provider told him that it had paused gender-transition treatment for patients younger than 19.</p><p>Withholding the funds, the plaintiffs argue, violates equal protection guarantees and conflicts with federal protections against sex discrimination in the Affordable Care Act and other statutes. Four parents of transgender minors who are also plaintiffs in the case say that Mr. Trump’s orders violate due process rights under the Fifth Amendment when it comes to their decisions on medical care for their children. Two other plaintiffs, a national L.G.B.T.Q. rights group called PFLAG and G.L.M.A., an L.G.B.T.Q. medical association, sued on behalf of their members.</p></div></div>
