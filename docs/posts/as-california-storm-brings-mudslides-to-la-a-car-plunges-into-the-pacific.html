But it still came as a shock when a Los Angeles Fire Department sport utility vehicle careened down a hill and landed in the Pacific Ocean on Thursday.</p><p>TV news footage captured the vehicle after it had plunged more than 20 feet with a fire inspector inside, swept away by a mud flow that had gushed in an instant down a fire-scarred mountain in Malibu, Calif. Once his vehicle turned upright after being tossed about by waves, the inspector cracked his door open, jumped out and trudged through muddy waters. He then clambered up the hill to safety, having the mental wherewithal to bring a bag and pair of shoes with him.</p><p>Somehow he emerged practically unscathed and was treated at a hospital with only minor injuries, fire officials said, without providing the inspector’s name. Still, it was one of the most dramatic scenes of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/weather/california-storm-flooding.html" title="">a furious storm that caused flooding and mudslides</a> in pockets of Southern California this week before it gave way to blue skies on Friday.</p><p>The storm turned some roads into rivers, sent muddy water cascading down hills and even briefly produced a tornado farther up the coast. On Friday, crews in Los Angeles County were working to clear roads and pick up more than 4,000 downed trees and branches, officials said. (The Fire Department vehicle was also pulled from the water on Friday afternoon.) But ultimately the damage across the area was not as severe or widespread as initially feared.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Officials had been most concerned about the areas that had been burned by wildfires last month. The flames destroyed 12,000 structures, but also damaged the soil and weakened its ability to absorb water, leading to sheets of mud moving downhill and collecting debris along the way.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14nat-ca-storms-02-fvqm/14nat-ca-storms-02-fvqm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14nat-ca-storms-02-fvqm/14nat-ca-storms-02-fvqm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14nat-ca-storms-02-fvqm/14nat-ca-storms-02-fvqm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Two workers wearing neon green vests and hard hats use shovels to dig mud from the roadway.

Duke’s, he said, was about two weeks out from finishing repairs for smoke damage from the Palisades fire. Now, the damage from the storm will delay the restaurant’s reopening.</p><p>“It’s kind of hard to to put weight on our experience, because everyone around us has lost so much, and we did survive the fire,” Mr. Chavez said. “It takes a little wind out of the sails to then see this destruction.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In Sierra Madre, Calif., in the foothills of the fire-scarred San Gabriel Mountains, mud careened into some neighborhoods, leaving roads and vehicles caked in earth.</p><p>The storm had spurred a number of evacuation orders across Southern California and prompted some road closures.
