(The couple later divorced.)</p><p>In their indictment, Jeonju prosecutors said they considered the money a bribe paid to Mr. Moon by Lee Sang-jik, a ​South Korean businessman and former lawmaker who controlled the airline. Mr. Lee made the son-in-law an executive there as a favor to Mr. Moon’s family although he was not qualified for the job, they said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Under Mr. Moon, Mr. Lee served as the head of a government agency in charge of promoting small businesses and was elected as a lawmaker affiliated with Mr. Moon’s Democratic Party in 2020. Mr. Lee lost his parliamentary seat after he was arrested and convicted on charges of embezzlement and election-law violations.</p><p>Mr. Moon used his presidential staff to help arrange his son-in-law’s employment and his relocation from South Korea to Thailand, Jeonju prosecutors said.</p><p>Mr. Lee, who was serving a prison term stemming from his previous corruption charges, was also indicted on an additional bribery charge on Thursday.​</p><p>The former son-in-law and Mr. Moon’s daughter were not indicted.</p><p>No immediate reaction from Mr. Moon was available on Thursday, according to his staff. His former aides have rejected the accusations, calling them a smear campaign against the ex-president.</p><p>Mr. Moon’s indictment is part of a familiar pattern in South Korea, where presidents or their relatives have often been ensnared by investigations before or after they left office. That includes four of the most recent former presidents who governed the country over the past two decades. Roh Moo-hyun <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/world/asia/24roh.html" title="">killed himself</a> in 2009 while being investigated for possible corruption. Two — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/world/asia/lee-myung-bak-south-korea-convicted.html" title="">Lee Myung-bak</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/world/asia/park-geun-hye-south-korea.html" title="">Park Geun-hye</a> —​ ended up in prison for corruption. And Yoon Suk Yeol, who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/asia/south-korea-removes-impeached-president.html" title="">removed from presidency</a> on April 4, is standing trial on the charge of committing insurrection when he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/10/world/asia/south-korea-martial-law-president-yoon.html?unlocked_article_code=1.3E4.SCq7.rkaW_VWiZx3a&amp;smid=url-share" title="">sent military troops</a> into the National Assembly during his short-lived imposition of martial law in December.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>These criminal investigations have contributed to the deepening political polarization in South Korea, as presidents from both the liberal and conservative camps have been targeted and, in turn, have called the prosecutions political revenge engineered by their enemies once they took power.</p><p>Under Mr. Yoon, a conservative, Mr. Moon and his former aides have faced a series of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/22/world/asia/north-korea-photos-moon.html" title="">criminal investigations.</a> In February, a court found four former national security aides to Mr. Moon guilty of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/asia/north-korea-fishermen-court.html" title="">abusing their official power.</a> But their prison terms were suspended as the court indicated that it considered the criminal charges to be politically motivated by the Yoon administration.</p><p>Prosecutors launched an investigation into Mr. Moon’s son-in-law near the end of his term. They said that when they have tried to summon Mr. Moon in recent months, he refused to present himself for questioning or to answer questions they sent him by mail.</p><p>Mr. Moon is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/world/asia/biden-north-korea-nuclear-deal-president-moon.html" title="">best known for his efforts</a> to build political reconciliation with North Korea. He met with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and helped mediate the summit meeting between Mr. Kim and President Donald J. Trump in 2018. He was criticized for failing to curb <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/world/asia/korea-housing-lh-scandal-moon-election.html" title="">soaring housing prices</a> but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/world/asia/south-korea-election.html" title="">was credited</a> for his country’s largely successful battle against the pandemic.</p><p>After leaving office, Mr. Moon moved to a new residence built in Yangsan in the southeast of South Korea. He has posted a series of comments on his Facebook account criticizing Mr. Yoon and his policies, especially after the failed imposition of martial law.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Choe Sang-Hun is the lead reporter for The Times in Seoul, covering South and North Korea.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
