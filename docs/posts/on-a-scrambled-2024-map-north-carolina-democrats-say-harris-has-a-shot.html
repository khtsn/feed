As she visits North Carolina on Friday to lay out her economic agenda, Democrats there are feeling hopeful again about delivering her a state where success has eluded them for 16 years — and where it is unclear if energy will be enough.</p><p>Apart from Mr. Obama’s lone triumph, Republicans have won every presidential contest in North Carolina since 1980. In 2020, Mr. Biden lost there by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-north-carolina.html" title="">less than two percentage points</a>, his narrowest defeat.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But the burst of enthusiasm from Ms. Harris’s ascent, as well as a galvanizing race for governor, have top North Carolina Democrats like Gov. Roy Cooper arguing that the state is newly viable.</p><p>Mr. Cooper, a two-term governor who was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/us/politics/roy-cooper-kamala-harris-vp.html" title="">contender</a> to serve as Ms. Harris’s running mate, said in an interview that he had not “felt this much excitement” since Mr. Obama’s first White House run, particularly among young people.</p><p>“People were concerned about the age of both President Biden and Donald Trump, and now that issue is off the table for Vice President Harris and more squarely on the shoulders of Donald Trump,” said Mr. Cooper, before making a sports analogy about the state of the race: “We were 12 points behind, and now we’ve made a fast, strong run, and we’ve tied the score.”</p><p>Interviews with nearly a dozen other North Carolina leaders and strategists showed that he is far from alone. They pointed to a wave of new volunteers, increased spending on the airwaves and tightening poll numbers across the battlegrounds.</p></div></div><div><p>Quality surveys of North Carolina since Ms. Harris took over the top of the ticket are limited, but on Wednesday the Cook Political Report <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/politics/harris-trump-polls.html" title="">found her statistically tied there with Mr. Trump</a>, whose polling edge over Mr. Biden was greater in the state than in any of the other top battlegrounds for much of the year.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gov.

On Friday, her discussion of the economy will offer a look at how she navigates an issue many voters have ranked as their highest priority this election, and on which they tend to still prefer Mr. Trump.</p><p>Republicans in North Carolina argue that Ms. Harris will remain unpopular with independent voters who feel their economic conditions have not improved under Mr. Biden and fault him for his handling of the southern border.</p><p>“Kamala Harris has a much higher bar to reach with independent voters because she’s asking them to trust her on her words, not on her record,” said Paul Shumaker, a veteran Republican strategist in Raleigh. Mr. Trump, he argued, still has more trust from some voters on issues like the economy and immigration and can win their support “because of the record,” rather than “because of his words.”</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/politics/trump-rally-asheville.html" title="">During a speech on Wednesday in Asheville, N.C.</a>, Mr. Trump, who has so far struggled to land consistent political attacks on Ms. Harris, blamed her for rising prices under inflation and tied Mr. Biden’s record to hers. The vice president, he said, “has cackled as the American economy burned.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Earlier that day, after reports showing that inflation had cooled slightly, Mr. Trump’s campaign issued a statement blasting “Kamalanomics” and underlining the higher costs of gasoline and household goods.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s allies have also cast doubt on Democrats’ prospects in North Carolina, pointing to their previous failed efforts to flip the state blue. Anna Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, said that in 2016 and 2020, “Democrats lit money on fire in North Carolina only to lose to President Trump.”</p><p>Democrats are certainly spending money again: Ms. Harris, who took over Mr. Biden’s campaign infrastructure, has a more robust campaign operation in North Carolina than Mr. Trump does.</p><p>The Harris campaign has more than 20 offices across the state — with five more set to open soon — and over 170 paid staff members, compared with roughly a dozen offices for Mr. Trump. Since Mr. Biden dropped out, the Harris campaign says, more than 12,000 North Carolinians have signed up to volunteer. And the number of registered Democrats has increased from when Mr. Biden was on the ticket.</p><p>“I think she’s got an outstanding chance to take the state,” said Representative Robert Reives, the Democratic leader in the State House. “At this time, it really is in the hands of a lot of voters who feel like their voices haven’t been heard.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>North Carolina is also home to one of the country’s most closely watched races for governor, which both parties hope will increase enthusiasm among their voting bases. Josh Stein, the state’s Democratic attorney general, is running against Mark Robinson, the state’s Republican lieutenant governor. Democrats have aimed to connect Mr. Robinson, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/us/politics/mark-robinson-north-carolina.html" title="">who has a history of offensive and incendiary remarks</a>, to Mr. Trump.</p><p>Dan Kanninen, the battleground states director for the Harris campaign, said the views of candidates like Mr. Robinson would energize Democrats and alienate suburban voters, independents and moderate Republicans up and down the ticket.</p><p>“The positions and the rhetoric and the politics that you see from Mark Robinson are just so directly drawn from how Donald Trump has built the modern Republican Party,” Mr. Kanninen said in an interview. “We’ve always believed North Carolinians would reject that level of extreme politics.”</p><p>A spokesman for Mr. Robinson did not respond to a request for comment. But during his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Trump lauded Mr. Robinson, calling him “a very good man” and “the next governor of North Carolina.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mark Robinson, the state’s lieutenant governor and the Republican candidate for governor, attended an event in Asheville on Wednesday hosted by Mr. Trump. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Both the Harris and Trump campaigns, as well as their allied outside groups, are spending heavily on television advertisements in North Carolina. Mr. Trump and his allies have reserved more than $13.6 million in advertising in the state for August, after barely spending anything in the previous months, according to AdImpact, a media tracking firm.</p><p>“They’re clearly worried,” Mr. Cooper said. “There’s no path that Trump can take that doesn’t involve winning North Carolina.”</p><p>The Harris campaign has reserved just $2.1 million this month in advertising in North Carolina, but the major super PAC backing the vice president, Future Forward, has bought advertising time worth nearly $14 million between now and Election Day.</p><p>And for Democratic candidates down the ballot, the increased voter enthusiasm is their biggest source of confidence.</p><p>“I think the big mental shift is going from, many people feeling they were having to choose between lesser evils, people they were not excited about, to now there being an option that a lot of people are simply genuinely excited about on its own terms,” said Jeff Jackson, the Democratic candidate for attorney general in North Carolina. “And they weren’t expecting that.”</p><p>Katie Glueck<!-- --> and <!-- -->Michael Gold<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maya King is a politics reporter covering the Southeast, based in Atlanta.
