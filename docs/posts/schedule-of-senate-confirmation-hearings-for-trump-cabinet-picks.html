He had a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/us/politics/trump-supporters-go-all-in-for-pete-hegseth-with-money-and-coordination.html" title="">troubled path to his hearing</a>, grappling with accusations of excessive drinking and an allegation of sexual assault that critics have used to question his fitness to lead the Defense Department, one of the most important posts in the federal government. Senators grilled Mr. Hegseth about many of those accusations during a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/14/us/hegseth-confirmation-trump/heres-what-to-know-about-the-hearing?smid=url-share" title="">tense, four-hour hearing on Tuesday.</a></p><h2 id="link-673ffddf">Wednesday</h2><h3 id="link-66233fde"><span>9 a.m.: Kristi Noem, secretary of homeland security</span></h3><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/kristi-noem-homeland-security.html" title="">Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota</a> is a staunch ally of Mr. Trump who has vowed to fulfill the president-elect’s promises of stricter border controls and mass deportations of unauthorized immigrants if confirmed to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Ms. Noem has previously used her authority as governor to intervene in the national immigration crisis, spending millions of taxpayer dollars to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/12/us/politics/noem-south-dakota-flood-homeland-security.html" title="">deploy the South Dakota National Guard to the U.S.-Mexico border</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h3 id="link-fdbed49"><span>9:30 a.m.: Pam Bondi, attorney general</span></h3><p>Pam Bondi, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/us/politics/pam-bondi-trump-attorney-general-lobbyist.html" title="">lobbyist</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/pamela-bondi-attorney-general-trump.html" title="">longtime loyalist</a> to Mr. Trump, made her name in Florida politics as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/pam-bondi-trump-attorney-general.html" title="">the state’s first female attorney general</a>. After endorsing Mr. Trump in the 2016 Republican primary, Ms. Bondi joined Mr. Trump’s legal defense team during his first impeachment in 2019, and later supported Mr. Trump’s fabricated claims of election fraud after his defeat to Joseph R.

The position would also give Mr. Ratcliffe an influential position on matters of national intelligence. As a congressman, Mr. Ratcliffe worked to burnish his credentials as a Trump loyalist by helping pursue investigations into President Biden’s son Hunter.</p><h3 id="link-7d43d799"><span>10 a.m.: Marco Rubio, secretary of state</span></h3><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/marco-rubio-trump-secretary-of-state.html" title="">Senator Marco Rubio of Florida</a> is a onetime political rival of Mr. Trump who has become a key adviser on foreign policy issues.

Mr. Zeldin is an avid Trump supporter who voted against certifying <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/nyregion/ny-lawmakers-trump.html" title="">the results of the 2020 election</a>.</p><h3 id="link-11d5c4cf"><span>10 a.m.: Doug Burgum, interior secretary</span></h3><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/climate/trump-burgum-for-interior-secretary.html" title="">Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota</a> made a $1 billion fortune in the tech industry before running for governor in his home state. Mr. Burgum, who has longstanding ties to fossil fuel companies and acted as a liaison between the Trump campaign and the oil executives who donated heavily to it, would be in charge of managing vast swaths of federal land and coastal waters in the Interior Department — as well as leases of those lands for oil and gas drilling.</p><h3 id="link-7fe47fcd"><span>10:30 a.m.: Scott Bessent, Treasury secretary</span></h3><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/business/trump-scott-bessent-treasury.html" title="">Scott Bessent</a> is a billionaire hedge fund manager who has been a central economic adviser to Mr. Trump as the president-elect created a campaign agenda centered on raising tariffs on imported goods.
