She made portraits of her circle: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/arts/lucas-samaras-dead.html" title="">Lucas Samaras</a>, Mr. Grooms and Mr. Thompson. She painted Jack Kerouac, LeRoi Jones and Jill Johnston, the lesbian feminist author and dance critic at The Village Voice.

She painted herself over and over again, in a variety of costumes and settings, her gaze stern and challenging. She was a helmeted Athena, arms akimbo, wearing a frothy pink chiffon dress from the 1930s; she painted herself as Medusa, and as a reclining nude. In pearls and a red sheath, she placed herself in front of Masada, the Israeli fortress where, legend has it, Jewish soldiers died by suicide rather than surrender to Roman forces.</p><p>Not that she would have joined them, had she been there, she told Amei Wallach, the film director and critic, who reviewed a show of Ms. Marcus’s in Newsday in 1979: “I’d be damned if I would take someone’s orders to kill myself.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Marcus’s 1978 work “Self Portrait at Masada.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Marcia Marcus/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York, via the Estate of Marcia Marcus</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Marcia the difficult,” Mr. Samaras called her teasingly in a letter in 1965.</p><p>Ms. Marcus <em>was</em> difficult. Or tough, as the painter Mimi Gross said recently: “And that’s an understatement.”</p><p>She had to be. Like her older peers, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/arts/design/alice-neel-metropolitan-museum-review.html" title="">Alice Neel</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/26/arts/design/26sleigh.html" title="">Sylvia Sleigh</a>, Ms. Marcus was doubly hobbled, as a woman and as a figurative painter working in a very male milieu, through periods of art history — Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism — when her sort of work was mostly out of fashion. Seen today, it is eye-poppingly modern. <a href="https://whitney.org/exhibitions/amy-sherald" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Just look at the work of Amy Sherald</a>, who painted Michelle Obama’s portrait.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Frieze: The Porch,” 1964.

But they were all working at the same time, and they were free to do what they wanted because no one was paying attention.”</p><p>Next week’s exhibit is the latest showcase for Ms. Marcus, who re-emerged as an unknown yet oddly familiar star in 2017. That year, at “Inventing Downtown: Artist-Run Galleries in New York City, 1952-1965,” a show at New York University’s Grey Art Gallery about upstart artist co-ops in the East Village and on the Lower East Side — Ms. Marcus’s scene — many viewers were apparently stopped in their tracks by one of her self-portraits. In the large-scale painting, she stands poker-faced, clad only in tights, heels and a bolero jacket. Who was this startlingly modern painter that seemingly no one had ever heard of, or had long forgotten?</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Renoir,” 1968.

But when she saw that Ms. Marcus had been part of Mr. Grooms’s gallery, Ms. Rachleff sought her out.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“She was wholly unsentimental, an artist through and through,” said Ms. Rachleff, who met Ms. Marcus in her TriBeCa apartment in 2013 and was struck by her work’s boldness and innovation, and by her sassy stoicism.</p><p>“She had lived with financial uncertainty and with the uncertainty of never being successful. She was absolutely uncompromising about it, even through the years of barely selling anything. If she didn’t take herself seriously, no one else would.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Marcus in an undated photo.

Marcia grew up in the Inwood section of Manhattan and wanted to be fashion designer. But her mother was adamant that she attend college instead of studying at a trade school, and perhaps become a teacher.</p><p>She was only 15 when she entered New York University’s College of Arts and Science, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in art, graduating in 1947. That same year, she married Harry Gutman, who worked for her father, mostly as a way to leave home.</p><p>A year later, the marriage was over, and Marcia was determined to change her surname. She had been named for her maternal grandfather, so she chose his first name.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“If I called myself Marcia Marcus,” <a href="https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-marcia-marcus-12609" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she said in an oral history</a> interview conducted in 1975 for the Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian, “then I was like myself both ways, in a way, and I had no connections with anything, but it also had some kind of significance.”</p><p>She had been drawing all through college, and now began to take classes at the Cooper Union and, later, at the Arts Students League.</p><p>Ms. Marcus met her second husband, Terence Barrell, at a party in Provincetown. They married in 1959, and he moved into her New York loft, in Alphabet City. Mr. Barrell was supportive of his wife to an extent that was unusual at the time. He worked as a cook and a teacher, but mostly cared for their two daughters, especially in 1962, when Ms. Marcus won a Fulbright grant to study in France, and the family moved to Paris. For a few years after they divorced in 1972, he continued to build the stretchers for her canvases.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Marcus, in 1985, seated in front of “Double Portrait II” at her New York City studio.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Marcus family</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Despite commissions for her portraiture, money was always tight. Ms. Marcus worked as a visiting professor at a series of colleges, including Vassar — piecemeal employment that left her more time to paint, although it meant she was financially insecure. In the 1990s, with great reluctance, she took a job as a substitute teacher in New York City’s public school system.</p><p>In addition to her daughters, she is survived by her sister, Barbara Rose, and four grandchildren. Ms. Marcus’s work is in the permanent collections of many institutions, including the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Smithsonian.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Ten months after the Grey Art Gallery show opened in 2017, the Eric Firestone Gallery in NoHo <a href="https://www.ericfirestonegallery.com/exhibitions/marcia-marcus-role-play-1958-73/installation-views?view=slider" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">put on a solo show of her work</a>. (Mr. Firestone also thought her self-portrait at the Grey was a standout.) After that, Ms. Marcus appeared in a few more exhibitions before the pandemic dawned, including one at the Borough of Manhattan Community College that paired her with Ms. Gross, the painter.</p><p>The critic John Yau, <a href="https://hyperallergic.com/503942/two-women-in-a-mans-art-world/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in his review of the show</a> for Hyperallergic, noted that both women used painting as “a vehicle of the imagination.”</p><p>“It is a stance that runs counter to other, better-known figurative artists, such as Philip Pearlstein, Alex Katz, and Fairfield Porter,” he wrote. “I would argue that what Marcus and Gross attained is equal to their male counterparts, and in that regard is an integral part of art history.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
