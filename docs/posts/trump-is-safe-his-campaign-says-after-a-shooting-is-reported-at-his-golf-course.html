Trump have made that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating people’s pets.</p><p>“If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union” after saying he’d received such complaints from constituents worried about immigration. Pressed on his choice of words by the host, Dana Bash, Mr. Vance said he meant the campaign was “creating the American media focusing on it.”</p><div><p>Mr. Vance sought to defend the debunked claims that have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/us/springfield-ohio-haitians-tension.html" title="">rattled Springfield</a> — Ohio’s Republican governor, Mike DeWine, called them “garbage” on Sunday — as Mr. Trump wrote on social media that he hated the pop megastar Taylor Swift, whose endorsement of Ms. Harris last week <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/politics/taylor-swift-voter-registration.html" title="">drove hundreds of thousands of people</a> to voter registration resources. Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign responded by invoking a slew of Ms. Swift’s songs, saying voters on both sides of the aisle are “ready to Forget That He Existed.”</p><p>There are now 51 days until Election Day. Here’s what else to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>On the trail:</strong> The candidates are set to maintain a feverish pace this week. Ms. Harris will make stops in the so-called Blue Wall states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, while her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, will hit the South, campaigning on Tuesday in Georgia and North Carolina. Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance will be in the Midwest this week, with events in Michigan and Wisconsin. On Monday night, Mr. Trump will be at his private club Mar-a-Lago in Florida <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/technology/donald-trump-cryptocurrency-business.html" title="">to unveil his crypto exchange, World Liberty Financial</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>RFK Jr. whale investigation:</strong> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told Trump supporters at an event on Saturday that he was being investigated over his handling of a whale carcass two decades ago. One of his daughters previously recounted that Mr. Kennedy had removed the whale’s head with a chain saw and drove it home on the roof of a minivan. Mr. Kennedy suggested the investigation was politically motivated and said that he believed he was protected by the statute of limitations.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Trump son’s racist claim</strong>: Donald Trump Jr., a key surrogate for his father’s campaign, <a href="#don-jr-trump-haitian-migrants" title="">weighed in on the debunked claim</a> about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. “You look at Haiti, you look at the demographic makeup, you look at the average I.Q. — if you import the third world into your country, you’re going to become the third world,” he told the conservative activist Charlie Kirk. “It’s not racist. It’s just fact.” Claims linking race, nationality and intelligence have long played a role in scientific racism, which uses pseudoscience to try to justify false claims of racial inferiority or superiority.</p></li><li><p><strong>No taxes on overtime:</strong> Mr. Trump said last week that, if elected, he would exempt overtime pay from taxes, the latest in his tax-cutting policy promises. The proposal is part of the former president’s efforts to win over working- and middle-class voters, but Mr. Trump has left many key details about the plan unaddressed. Some projections estimate that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/business/trump-tax-overtime-pay-cost.html?smid=url-share" title="">the proposal could cost the government billions of dollars</a>.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>A push for Latino votes</strong>: The Voto Latino Foundation is set to begin a $5 million initiative this week <a href="#latino-voters-america-ferrera" title="">encouraging Latino voters to cast a ballot in November</a>. Several Latino celebrities, including America Ferrera, Gabriel Luna and Jessica Alba, have agreed to participate in the campaign, which will feature voter-registration drives and workshops. An estimated 36.2 million Latinos are eligible to vote this year, though a survey from the Pew Research Center in 2020 found that they were less likely than white or Black voters to be contacted by campaigns or organizations supporting candidates.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="18" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2I4MjA2MmY4LTk2MzctNTY1Mi04NzlkLWRlMzMxMmY2MjMzMA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/15/us/harris-trump-election#trump-is-safe-his-campaign-says-after-a-shooting-is-reported-at-his-golf-course" data-source-id="100000009692960"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-15T19:04:47.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 15, 2024, 3:04 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Trump campaign put out a statement after the shooting incident at one of his golf courses on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>A shooting took place on the grounds of the Trump International Golf Course West Palm Beach on Sunday while former President Donald J.

Kennedy Jr., told a crowd on Saturday night that he was being investigated for his handling of a whale carcass decades ago.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy, who endorsed Mr. Trump last month after ending his own independent run for the presidency, said at the event in Glendale, Ariz., that he had received a letter from a national fisheries institute “saying they were investigating me for collecting a whale specimen 20 years ago.” He suggested that the inquiry was politically motivated, and said that he believed he was protected by the statute of limitations.</p><div><p>The whale episode surfaced over the summer after Mr. Kennedy acknowledged that he had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/04/us/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr-bear-central-park.html" title="">left a dead bear</a> cub in Central Park in 2014 as a prank. That drew attention to a 2012 <a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a924/kick-kennedy-interview/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Town &amp; Country</a> article in which his daughter Kick Kennedy said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/us/politics/rfk-jr-whale-head.html" title="">Mr. Kennedy had once chain-sawed the head off a dead whale</a> on the shore of Hyannis Port, Mass., and made the five-hour drive to their home in Mount Kisco, N.Y., with it affixed to the roof of a minivan.</p><p>The mention of the investigation was an odd moment at a campaign stop where Mr. Kennedy toggled between urging his followers to support Mr. Trump and continuing to try to sell his own policies on health and environmental issues, now with a refreshed MAGA inflection.</p><p>“Make America healthy again!” Mr. Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic who has promoted a disproved link between vaccines and autism, declared to applause from hundreds in the gymnasium of Arizona Christian University. “He’s going to end the chronic disease epidemic, and he wanted my help to do it.”</p><p>When Mr. Kennedy was weighing whether to end his bid, he approached both Vice President Kamala Harris and Mr. Trump to see if they might offer him a cabinet position. The Harris campaign declined to meet with him, but he found a receptive audience in Mr. Trump, even though they had traded insults as rivals. The former president has not publicly promised Mr. Kennedy a cabinet post but has indicated that he would work with Mr. Kennedy on a task force about chronic health issues.</p><p>At the event, where he appeared with former Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, another former Democrat, Mr. Kennedy attributed political polarization in the country to “hypnosis and a psy-op” orchestrated by those in power.</p><p>Last month, the political arm of the Center for Biological Diversity, a progressive environmental group, sent a letter to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and called for an investigation into the whale episode, arguing that Mr. Kennedy may have broken conservation laws.</p><p>It is a violation of federal law to collect parts from a protected marine animal so long as there are still “soft tissues” on the carcass.</p><p>Onstage at the rally, Mr. Kennedy said he had received a letter shortly after he endorsed Mr. Trump from the “National Marine Fisheries Institute.” Mr. Kennedy may have been referring to the National Marine Fisheries Service, commonly known as NOAA Fisheries, which oversees marine protection. Representatives of NOAA Fisheries did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy said at the rally he had written back to his would-be whale investigators, accusing the government of permitting offshore wind farms which kill whales en masse, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/us/politics/biden-trump-fact-check-debate.html" title="">a claim that Mr. Trump has also made for which there is no evidence.</a></p><p>Asked after the rally about the investigation, Mr. Kennedy declined to provide more details, saying the subject was “gossipy nonsense.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYTg1NjI4MDEtY2Y3NC01ZDNmLTlmNmMtODk2ZWQyNGE2MjY3"><div id="a8562801-cf74-5d3f-9f6c-896ed24a6267" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/15/us/harris-trump-election#a8562801-cf74-5d3f-9f6c-896ed24a6267"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maggie-astor"><img alt="Maggie Astor" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/multimedia/author-maggie-astor/author-maggie-astor-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/multimedia/author-maggie-astor/author-maggie-astor-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/multimedia/author-maggie-astor/author-maggie-astor-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-15T16:17:47.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 15, 2024, 12:17 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Former President Donald J.

Trump have spread suggesting Haitian migrants were eating pets, saying that he was willing “to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention.”</p><p>And Mr. Vance responded indignantly when asked about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/us/springfield-ohio-haitians-tension.html" title="">the bomb threats</a> that have upended life in Springfield, Ohio, the city where he and Mr. Trump falsely claimed that the pets were being eaten.</p><div><p>“I’ve been trying to talk about the problems in Springfield for months,” Mr. Vance said on CNN, referring to strains he said that a large influx of Haitian migrants had placed on the city’s public services. He went on: “The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes. If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do.”</p><p>When the CNN host, Dana Bash, noted that he had used the word “creating,” Mr. Vance replied, “I say that we’re creating a story, meaning we’re creating the American media focusing on it.”</p><p>Even as Mr. Vance was standing by the claims in interviews on CNN, CBS News and NBC News, Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, a Republican, was rebutting them in an interview on ABC News. Mr. DeWine said the claim that migrants were eating pets was “a piece of garbage that was simply not true.” And the governor said that while there had been some “challenges” involved in accommodating thousands of migrants, they were there legally and had benefited Springfield economically.</p><p>Mr. Vance said that the claims — which have been debunked by city officials in Springfield, and which resemble smears that have been lodged against immigrants for decades — had come from “firsthand” accounts from his constituents. He called one of his interviewers a “Democratic propagandist” for connecting his words and Mr. Trump’s to the bomb threats, and told another that she should “ignore” the threats and focus on Vice President Kamala Harris’s immigration policies instead.</p><p>And he demeaned immigrants in vivid terms, saying they spread diseases and claiming that Democrats wanted to “overwhelm” cities and towns with them.</p><p>“This is what Kamala Harris wants to do to every town in this country,” Mr. Vance said on CBS. “Overwhelm them with migration, stress their municipal budgets, see communicable diseases on the rise. What is happening in Springfield is coming to every town and city in this country if Kamala Harris’s open border policies are allowed to continue.”</p><p>The false claims about the immigrants in Springfield have exploded since Mr. Vance became the first prominent national figure to promote them last week, repeating them on social media. The Trump campaign quickly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/us/politics/trump-vance-haitians-ohio.html" title="">amplified them</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/us/politics/jd-vance-backtrack-haitian-migrants-pets.html" title="">Mr. Vance subsequently acknowledged</a> that “it’s possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false,” while encouraging his supporters to continue spreading them.</p><p>But Mr. Trump amplified the claims when he repeated them to an audience of tens of millions of people during his debate with Ms. Harris on Tuesday.</p><p>Mr. Vance’s interviewers on Sunday noted that Springfield city officials had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/politics/springfield-ohio-bomb-threat-trump-pets.html" title="">asked national figures like him and Mr. Trump</a> to stop demonizing the migrants, who are mostly in the country legally under a temporary authorization program for people whose homelands are in crisis.</p><p>“All these federal politicians that have negatively spun our city, they need to know they’re hurting our city, and it was their words that did it,” the mayor, Rob Rue, <a href="https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/springfield-mayor-on-politicians-after-bomb-threat-it-was-their-words-that-did-it" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told WSYX, a local news station in Ohio</a>.</p><p>But Mr. Vance expressed no regret about any of his statements and responded testily to mentions of the bomb threats.</p><p>“I want whoever made these threats to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” he told Margaret Brennan of CBS. “But we don’t believe, Margaret, in a heckler’s veto in this country.” He added: “I think that we should ignore these ridiculous psychopaths who are threatening violence on a small Ohio town and focus on the fact that we have a vice president who’s not doing her job in protecting that small Ohio town.”</p><p>On CNN, Ms. Bash asked what Mr. Vance, as a senator from Ohio, had done to help Springfield. “Instead of saying things that are wrong and actually causing the hospitals, the schools, the government buildings to be evacuated because of bomb threats, because of the cats and dogs thing, why not actually be constructive in helping to better integrate them into the community?” she asked.</p><p>Mr. Vance called the question “more appropriate for a Democratic propagandist than it is for an American journalist” and denied that his and Mr. Trump’s words had any connection to the threats that immediately followed them.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZWQ0ZmI0M2UtMjZhMC01Y2I0LThlOWUtYmEzMDNmZDhiOWZi"><div id="ed4fb43e-26a0-5cb4-8e9e-ba303fd8b9fb" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/15/us/harris-trump-election#ed4fb43e-26a0-5cb4-8e9e-ba303fd8b9fb"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maggie-astor"><img alt="Maggie Astor" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/multimedia/author-maggie-astor/author-maggie-astor-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/multimedia/author-maggie-astor/author-maggie-astor-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/multimedia/author-maggie-astor/author-maggie-astor-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-15T13:34:36.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 15, 2024, 9:34 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>“That was bonkers,” Gov.

Trump’s debunked claim about immigrants from Haiti stealing and eating people’s pets in a small Ohio city, the former president’s oldest son weighed in with his own aspersions on Haitians.</p><p>Donald Trump Jr. suggested on Thursday that Haitian immigrants were less intelligent than people from other countries, and claimed that there was demographic evidence to back this up. He provided none.</p><div><p>“You look at Haiti, you look at the demographic makeup, you look at the average I.Q. — if you import the third world into your country, you’re going to become the third world,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with Charlie Kirk on Real America’s Voice, a conservative broadcasting network. “That’s just basic. It’s not racist. It’s just fact.”</p><p>Claims inherently linking race, nationality and intelligence have long played a role in scientific racism, which uses pseudoscience to try to justify false claims of racial inferiority or superiority. And intelligence quotient testing, a commonly used measure of intelligence, has long been criticized as unreliable.</p><p>Mr. Trump has emerged as a key campaign surrogate for his father. A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Both Trumps have recently advanced the debunked claim that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/us/politics/trump-vance-haitians-ohio.html" title="">Haitian migrants were stealing and eating their neighbors’ pets</a> in Springfield, Ohio. On their social media accounts, they have each <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/donald-trump-kamala-harris-campaign-springfield-memes.html" title="">posted memes</a> of cats and dogs, nodding at the false claims and implicitly reminding people of the Trump campaign’s hard-line immigration stance.</p><p>At the presidential debate on Tuesday, the former president repeated these claims to the tens of millions watching, giving them their widest platform yet. His assertion drew an incredulous look from his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.</p><p>“In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs — the people that came in,” he said, referring to Haitian migrants. “They’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there.”</p><p>In the aftermath of the debate, there were a number of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/biden-trump-haitian-immigrants-cats-dogs.html" title="">bomb threats in Springfield</a>, closing its City Hall, schools and a motor vehicles office.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s fixation on Springfield drew a heated rebuke on Friday from President Biden, who noted that Haitian immigrants were “under attack in our country right now” and who appeared to denounce Mr. Trump without naming him.</p><p>“It’s simply wrong,” Mr. Biden said. “There’s no place in America. This has to stop, what he’s doing. It has to stop.”</p><p>The National Haitian American Elected Officials Network, a nonpartisan group for Haitian American politicians, rejected Mr. Trump’s comments about Haitians and intelligence.</p><p>“That is so sad,” said Mary Estimé-Irvin, the group’s chairwoman. “The campaign is desperate.”</p><p>In a statement, the group added that many Haitian Americans will “vote overwhelmingly as one bloc to send a loud message to this racist-political nonsense.”</p><p>The Haitian population of Springfield has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/us/springfield-ohio-school-bus-crash-haiti-immigrants.html" title="">grown significantly in recent years</a>. During the last census, in 2020, a little more than 58,000 people lived in the city; since the pandemic, between 12,000 and 20,000 Haitian immigrants have arrived, according to estimates by city officials. Most Haitians in Springfield and elsewhere in the United States are in the country legally, many having received temporary protected status from the Biden administration under a program started by President George W. Bush for citizens of countries in turmoil.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
