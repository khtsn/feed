The window for public comments on the proposal, which is part of a broader government consultation on copyright and artificial intelligence, was set to close Tuesday night.</p><p>“Opt-out shifts the burden of controlling your works onto the rights holder,” said Ed Newton-Rex, who organized the album and is the chief executive of Fairly Trained, a nonprofit that certifies generative A.I. companies for the training data they use.</p><p>“Basically,” he said, of the current government proposal, “it flips copyright on its head.”</p><p>Even as some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/arts/ai-art-overlap.html" title="">artists</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/28/arts/design/artists-artificial-intelligence.html" title="">experiment</a> with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/card/2024/11/13/technology/openai-artist-alexander-reben" title="">artificial intelligence</a>, many fear that developers are inappropriately using their work without compensating them. (Publishers and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/business/media/newspapers-sued-microsoft-openai.html" title="">journalists are also concerned</a>: The New York Times has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" title="">sued</a> OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. OpenAI and Microsoft have denied those claims.)</p><p>The album — titled “<a href="https://www.isthiswhatwewant.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Is This What We Want?</a>” — has 12 songs, each of which has a one-word title that together spell out the sentence: “The British government must not legalize music theft to benefit A.I. companies.” </p><p>Only some of the artists who were part of the album project directly contributed to the audio, Mr. Newton-Rex said, although he said that all shared in the credits.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Newton-Rex and other <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/11/uk-copyright-law-consultation-fixed-favour-ai-firms-peer-says" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">critics</a> fear that artists may not even know if their work is being used to train the A.I. models. He said that he had previously run opt-out schemes at generative A.I. companies, which he called an “illusion,” in part because copyrighted work can spread so quickly online that creators can lose control of it.</p><p>Powerful A.I. developers have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/06/technology/tech-giants-harvest-data-artificial-intelligence.html" title="">repeatedly shown</a> that they are willing to skirt copyright law to train systems. And Britain, desperate to revive its sluggish economy, is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-opportunities-action-plan-government-response/ai-opportunities-action-plan-government-response" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">aggressively trying to court A.I. developers</a>. Prime Minister Keir Starmer recently said he plans to push Britain to be “<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-sets-out-blueprint-to-turbocharge-ai" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the world leader</a>.”</p><p>The country has already signaled its willingness to break with the European Union and some of its other allies, like Australia and Canada, in its attitude to the technology. At a recent A.I. summit in Paris, Britain <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/world/europe/vance-speech-paris-ai-summit.html" title="">sided with the United States</a> in declining to sign a <a href="https://www.elysee.fr/en/emmanuel-macron/2025/02/11/statement-on-inclusive-and-sustainable-artificial-intelligence-for-people-and-the-planet" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">communiqué</a> calling for A.I. to be “inclusive and sustainable.”</p><p>Now, Britain is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-opportunities-action-plan-government-response/ai-opportunities-action-plan-government-response" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arguing</a> that a “competitive copyright regime” is part of what is needed to “build cutting-edge, secure and sustainable A.I. infrastructure.” The proposals, which were announced late last year, call the current system unclear and say that it is hampering innovation for both A.I. developers and artists. Britain <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-consults-on-proposals-to-give-creative-industries-and-ai-developers-clarity-over-copyright-laws" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">argues</a> that the proposed changes are meant to give artists more control over the way their work is used and more opportunities for payment.</p><p>In response to a request for comment, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said that Britain’s current copyright structure is holding both artists and A.I. companies back from full innovation. But it also noted that no decisions had been finalized and that it would consider the responses it received before setting out next steps.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Britain’s consultation process, in which the government asks for public input at the early stages of policy proposals, is designed to take in feedback and often leads to revisions.</p><p>As the consultation period ended on Tuesday, British artists and publishers released a series of protests. Several newspapers featured identical <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2025/feb/25/make-it-fair#:~:text=The%20campaign%20cover%20wrap%20states,industries%20%E2%80%93%20it&#39;s%20only%20fair.%E2%80%9D" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">campaign</a> images <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-daily-express-the-sun-daily-star-daily-mail-b2704106.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">across their front pages</a> that <a href="https://www.news.co.uk/latest-news/make-it-fair/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">read</a>: “Make it fair: The government wants to change the U.K.’s laws to favor big tech platforms so they can use British creative content.”</p><p>The musicians Paul McCartney, Elton John and Dua Lipa, the novelist Kazuo Ishiguro and the actor Stephen Fry were among the artists who signed a <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/comment/letters-to-editor/article/times-letters-protecting-uk-creative-copyright-ai-latest-news-zz3csj96v#:~:text=Sir%2C%20The%20government&#39;s%20proposal%20to,creative%20sectors%20to%20Big%20Tech." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">letter</a> in protest that was published in The Times of London.</p><p>“There is no moral or economic argument for stealing our copyright,” the artists wrote. “Taking it away will devastate the industry and steal the future of the next generation.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
