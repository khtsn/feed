    <h1>Naval Academy Takes Steps to End Diversity Policies in Books and Admissions</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The academy’s library in Annapolis, Md., houses roughly 590,000 print books, 322 databases, and more than 5,000 print journals and magazines, Commander Hawkins said.</p><p>The court filing on the admissions policy, submitted by the Naval Academy, the Department of Defense, Mr. Hegseth and other officials, states that the Naval Academy changed its admissions policy in February in response to federal directives prohibiting the practice of considering race, ethnicity and sex during the admissions process.</p><p>The Naval Academy superintendent issued revised internal guidance on Feb. 14, stating that would not be happening, according to the filing. The superintendent, Vice Admiral Yvette M. David, <a href="https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/hearings/to-conduct-oversight-and-receive-testimony-on-the-status-of-the-military-service-academies" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reaffirmed</a> this change on Wednesday, when she testified before a subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p><p>“At no time are race, sex or ethnicity considered in the qualification of a candidate,” she said. The Naval Academy did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the admissions policy on Friday.</p><p>Thus far, the review of Nimitz Library’s holdings has identified 900 books that may run afoul of the defense secretary’s verbal order. According to a second defense official, they include “The Autobiography of Martin Luther King Jr.,” “Einstein on Race and Racism,” and a biography on Jackie Robinson.</p></div></div>
