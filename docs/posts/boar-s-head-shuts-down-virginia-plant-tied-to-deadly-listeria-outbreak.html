That finding could have resulted in a warning letter or even a suspension of production there, but the U.S. Department of Agriculture did not take strict measures and allowed the plant to stay open.</p><p>In July, Boar’s Head began recalling its lunch meats after health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began to trace hospitalizations that now number 57, as well as nine deaths of people 70 and older, back to the meats produced at the site. It paused production at the plant in late July.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Given the seriousness of the outbreak, and the fact that it originated at Jarratt, we have made the difficult decision to indefinitely close this location,” the company <a href="https://boarshead.com/products-recall-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement posted Friday</a>.</p><p>Jonathan Williams, communications director for the union that represents about 500 workers at the plant, said the company was providing severance packages and relocation to the employees.</p><p>Mr. Williams, of the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Local 400 union, said the company gave employees the option to continue to work at the other Virginia processing center that the company operates or to transfer to others.
