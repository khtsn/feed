And while one alcoholic drink daily also reduces the likelihood of strokes caused by blood clots among both men and women, the report found, even occasional heavy drinking negates the benefits.</p><p>The report, prepared by an outside scientific review panel under the auspices of the Department of Health and Human Services, is one of two competing assessments that will be used to shape the influential U.S. Dietary Guidelines, which are to be updated this year.</p><p>The government has for several decades recommended a limit of two standard alcoholic drinks per day for men and one for women.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In December, a review of the data by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine supported this advice, <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28582/review-of-evidence-on-alcohol-and-health" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">finding that moderate drinking was linked to fewer heart attack and stroke deaths</a>, and fewer deaths overall, compared with no drinking.</p><p>But some experts fear that the harms of moderate drinking have been understated, particularly the risk of cancer, which is the leading cause of death among people under 85, according to the American Cancer Society.</p><p>In 2020, the last time the dietary guidelines came up for review, scientific advisers suggested lowering the recommendation to one drink daily for both men and women. That advice did not appear in the final guidelines.</p><p>The analysis from the National Academies tied moderate drinking in women to a small but significant increase in breast cancer, but said there was insufficient evidence to tie alcohol to other cancers.</p><p>This month, however, the U.S. Surgeon General, citing mounting scientific evidence, called for labeling alcohol with cancer warnings similar to those that appear on cigarettes. The report issued on Tuesday found that the increased cancer risk comes with any amount of alcohol consumption and rises with higher levels of drinking.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Drinking is linked to a higher risk of death for seven types of cancer, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer as well as cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx and esophagus.</p><p>Men and women are both vulnerable to these health harms, but women are much more likely to develop a cancer linked to drinking, the report said.</p><p>“Among the U.S. population, the risk of dying from alcohol use begins at low levels of average use,” the report said. “Higher levels of alcohol consumption are linked with progressively higher mortality risk.”</p><p>Those who consume more than seven drinks per week have a one in 1,000 risk of dying from a condition related to alcohol. The risk increases to one in 100 if consumption is more than nine drinks a week.</p><p><em>This article will be updated.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Roni Caryn Rabin is a Times health reporter focused on maternal and child health, racial and economic disparities in health care, and the influence of money on medicine.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/roni-caryn-rabin">More about Roni Caryn Rabin</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
