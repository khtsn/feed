In Boston, Ky., roughly 35 miles south of Louisville, Bruce Gooden could see the water creeping up as he cut hair at his barbershop near Lick Creek.</p><p>The heavy rain swelling the creek could not flow into the nearby Rolling Fork River, which was already above flood stage. Mr. Gooden, 63, had seen the water rise before, but hour after hour of heavy downpours and cracking lightning fed a sense of doom.</p><p>“The water has never made it into my shop before, but I fear it will happen this time,” he said as he kept clipping. He had sand piled in the bed of his truck, he said, and was ready to bag and stack it if the water rose high enough.</p><p>“I’ll play it by ear,” he said. “I’ll stay open as long as I can.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-04-02-storm-radar-embed" data-id="100000010087644" data-source-id="100000010087644"><div slug="2025-04-02-storm-radar-embed" data-sourceid="100000010087644" id="embed-id-100000010087644">

On Saturday, forecasters expect the threat to spread into the boot heel of Missouri and western Kentucky and Tennessee.</p><p>Flooding is expected on roads, and major rivers will probably spill over their banks because the saturated ground will not be able to absorb several more inches of rain.</p><p>“I think, unfortunately, the next 24 to 36 hours is when we’re going to start to see the heaviest rain totals of this event,” said Frank Pereira, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said on Friday morning.</p><p>Severe thunderstorms that spawn tornadoes are also possible in the same general area on Friday. That risk will bump up on Saturday in a zone that includes Memphis, Little Rock, Ark., and Jackson, Miss. Powerful and damaging wind gusts and large hailstones — perhaps bigger than limes — are more likely in this area than tornadoes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/04/multimedia/04NAT-STORM4-gqkc/04NAT-STORM4-gqkc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/04/multimedia/04NAT-STORM4-gqkc/04NAT-STORM4-gqkc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/04/multimedia/04NAT-STORM4-gqkc/04NAT-STORM4-gqkc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="An overturned white car sits in front of a largely destroyed building with white walls and a red roof.
