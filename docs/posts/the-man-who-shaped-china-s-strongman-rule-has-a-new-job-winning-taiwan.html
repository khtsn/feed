The interviews and writings illuminate how he rose to the apex of power by developing ideas that he put to the service of China’s leaders, with a lasting influence on how the country is ruled.</p><p>Mr. Wang is credited with honing the Communist Party doctrines that have guided China’s rise, founded on the conviction that only the unyielding dominance of the party can secure the country’s success in the face of rapid economic change and intensifying competition with Western powers.</p><p>More recently, Mr. Xi has entrusted Mr. Wang with handling the fraught political relations with Taiwan, the island democracy that Beijing wants to absorb. Taiwanese officials say Mr. Wang has been overseeing efforts to deepen Chinese influence over the island, through selective displays of good will and covert influence activities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Yet Mr. Wang, 69, is little known to outsiders. A professor turned party theorist, he stopped giving interviews after he began working at the Communist Party headquarters in 1995, cutting off contact with most former colleagues and staying aloof from foreign visitors.</p><p>Since 2012, he has been central to distilling Mr. Xi’s vision for China into an ideological program for a superpower that is technologically advanced, unabashedly authoritarian and increasingly fortified against American-led containment.</p><p>Mr. Wang “provided the ideological spirit for authoritarianism over the last 30 years,” said <a href="https://www.cfr.org/expert/rush-doshi" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rush Doshi</a>, a former deputy senior director for China on President Biden’s National Security Council who is now at the Council on Foreign Relations and Georgetown University. “He has helped craft the national narrative.”</p><h2 id="link-2e462c4b">Winning Over Taiwan</h2><p>Now Mr. Wang is turning his ideas, political acumen and influence with Mr. Xi to Taiwan.

He has politely quizzed Nationalist lawmakers: Who has old roots in Taiwan? Who came from families that fled mainland China in 1949? He asked them to describe their concerns, making a point that he was paying close attention, said several members of the delegations.</p><p>His overtures to the opposition fit with Beijing’s strategy of isolating Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, and his governing Democratic Progressive Party, which rejects China’s claim of sovereignty over the island.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Mr. Wang has overseen Chinese efforts to influence Taiwanese public opinion with online campaigns, which amplify messages that are skeptical of American power, scathing about Mr. Lai and admiring of China, according to two Taiwanese security officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.</p><p>At the same time, China has hardened its military approach to Taiwan; it recently held <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/world/asia/china-taiwan-blockade-drills.html" title="">exercises encircling the island</a>. It is also using legal measures to intimidate Taiwanese people, like the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/world/asia/taiwan-china-travel-warning.html" title="">recently issued rules</a> calling for execution, in extreme cases, for supporters of independence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Watching state media coverage of China’s military drills near Taiwan this month at a mall in Beijing.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Greg Baker/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Such efforts may appear crude and likely to alienate many Taiwanese, but over time, their chilling effect could make a difference politically, said <a href="https://globaltaiwan.org/member/john-dotson/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">John Dotson</a>, the deputy director of the Global Taiwan Institute in Washington. “Even if it only moves public opinion by a few points, that can be decisive,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Wang may also have considerable influence over China’s plan for unification. Mr. Xi has said Taiwan must accept the “one country, two systems” formula that Beijing used for Hong Kong, but that arrangement is widely rejected in Taiwan. Instead, Chinese officials like Mr. Wang now speak of a “comprehensive plan” for Taiwan, a phrase that allows for adjustments to the formula.</p><p>“If his past roles are any guide,” Mr. Doshi said, referring to Mr. Wang, “he’s likely been tasked with figuring out an approach to Taiwan that involves crafting long-term strategy, as well as the ideological framework for unification.”</p><h2 id="link-b4eb6e9">From Democratic Hopes to ‘Neo-Authoritarianism’</h2><p>Mr. Wang, like Mr. Xi, is the son of Communist officials and was one of the few Chinese youths chosen to go to university during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, a decade of violence and zealotry when students were drilled in Marx, Lenin and Mao.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But as Mr. Wang started graduate school at Fudan University in Shanghai in 1978, many in China were starting to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/world/asia/china-economy-julian-gewirtz.html" title="">look to Western countries</a> for inspiration. Talk of democracy, suppressed under Mao, crept into classrooms, and Mr. Wang, who specialized in political science, became an avid student of Western political traditions.</p><p>“He was quite open and lively,” Chen Kuide, who shared a dormitory room with Mr. Wang at Fudan, said in an interview. “He also wrote contemporary poetry.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Wang, left, at Fudan University in Shanghai in May 1988.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Hsu Chung-mao</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Wang became fascinated with the “political culture” of democracies: the shared public faith in government that kept countries stable as leaders came and went.

Student protests for democracy broke out in 1986. Even as Mr. Wang continued to praise democracy as a long-term aspiration, he cautioned against rapid political liberalization.</p><p>Abrupt political opening could bring upheaval and derail China’s economic takeoff, Mr. Wang wrote, arguing that its leaders could learn from South Korea, Taiwan and other Asian “dragons” that had grown rapidly under authoritarian rulers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shanghai in the early 1990s.

He was repulsed by a camp for homeless people in Berkeley, which he described as dirty. He followed the 1988 presidential race and concluded that voters ultimately had limited say in government.</p><p>His American sojourn appeared to reinforce his belief that a country had to instill the correct attitudes in its citizens, including respect for authority and tradition, or disorder would weaken it from within.

Their grip on economic resources had weakened in the previous decade, and revenue-rich local officials sometimes chafed at orders from Beijing, he warned.</p><p>He argued that as China opened to the outside world and the party retreated from directing people’s lives, leaders needed new ways to retain their loyalty.
