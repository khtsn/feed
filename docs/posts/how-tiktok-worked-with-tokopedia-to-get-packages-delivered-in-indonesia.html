    <h1>How TikTok Worked With Tokopedia to Get Packages Delivered in Indonesia</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Iksan knows the roads around his hometown on the Indonesian island of Sumatra like the back of his hand. He runs a package sorting center from his garage, a small but essential piece of a sprawling network delivering goods bought on Tokopedia, the country’s<strong> </strong>biggest homegrown e-commerce company.</p><p>His team of three motorcycle riders slog through rice fields and palm oil plantations to bring their neighbors boxes and padded envelopes that were purchased online just days before.</p><p>In Indonesia, getting a package from one place to another requires extraordinary logistical planning and often intense physical effort. The nation of 270 million people and 17,000 islands spans a distance as far as Britain to Iran.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Tokopedia spent millions of dollars and more than a decade building a complex web of drivers, warehouses and connections with cargo companies. That was a selling point last year when TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese internet giant ByteDance, needed a local partner in Indonesia for its TikTok Shop e-commerce feature. It promptly took a stake in Tokopedia.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An outpost of the delivery company J&amp;T Cargo that Iksan runs from his garage.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Iksan in his office at home.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Tokopedia knows the local market so well,” said Dewi Rengganis, an analyst at Frost &amp; Sullivan, a consulting firm. “TikTok needed this knowledge.”</p><p>Tokopedia and other companies have developed software to help dispatchers and drivers monitor traffic on tiny side streets in out-of-the-way places and the perpetually clogged highways of the capital, Jakarta, on Java, the central island.</p><p>Indonesians spent over $53 billion online in 2023, almost as much as everyone else in Southeast Asia combined. As in many places, ordering for delivery became part of everyday life in Indonesia during the Covid-19 pandemic. The growing popularity of e-commerce on social media apps like TikTok allowed Indonesian businesses to reach customers far away.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The conglomerate behind Tokopedia, GoTo,<strong> </strong>has a logistics arm that operates warehouses like this one on the edge of Jakarta.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Workers pack boxes around the clock, with the top performers doing over 1,600 in an eight-hour shift.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>To make it all work, a vast fleet of drivers and warehouse workers run a grueling relay race across the country. Most are young men willing to work long hours for a few dollars a day.</p><p>“I could be on the road for 12 hours only to deliver around 20 packages,” said Mr. Iksan, who is 27 and, like many Indonesians, goes by one name. He and his team’s vehicles regularly get stuck in the mud between rice paddies.</p><p>The e-commerce companies — Tokopedia and Shopee are the biggest — compete with offers of free shipping and ever-faster delivery times. A package’s journey starts in a warehouse. The conglomerate behind Tokopedia, GoTo,<strong> </strong>has a logistics arm that operates five warehouses on Java, home to about half the country’s population.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-9"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/autossell/INDONESIA-DELIVERY-VIDEO-02B_VIDEO-COVER/INDONESIA-DELIVERY-VIDEO-02B_VIDEO-COVER-superJumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/autossell/INDONESIA-DELIVERY-VIDEO-02B_VIDEO-COVER/INDONESIA-DELIVERY-VIDEO-02B_VIDEO-COVER-superJumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/10/23/128463_1_INDONESIA-DELIVERY-v2-vertical_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The warehouse typically employs 200 to 300 workers on regular days, but the numbers rise greatly during peak shopping periods.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The largest facility sits hulking on the outskirts of Jakarta. Hundreds of people pack boxes around the clock. Managers said workers were allowed to take breaks during prayer times. But as the evening call to prayer echoed across the truck bay on a recent Friday, no one stopped unloading. Big screens near the ceiling showed the number of packages each worker needed to pack to keep his or her job.</p><p>The top performers can pack more than 1,600 packages in an eight-hour shift. They’re almost all gig workers, not employees. If they don’t hit their targets, managers said, they aren’t asked to come back.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-12"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A worker sorting packages at a warehouse in Jakarta.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Delivery drivers must master the art of stacking as many packages as possible on a motorbike.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>On an average day, they churn out around 20,000 packages, Hermiranti, a manager at the warehouse, said.</p><p>But orders spike toward the end of each month, when most people across the country get paid.

His route through the heart of the port city of Lampung in<strong> </strong>southern<strong> </strong>Sumatra usually takes about an hour to make 50 deliveries. Sprinters on the outskirts of the city, who cover territory up into the mountains, can spend seven hours bouncing over potholed roads to deliver as few as four packages.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>And when they get to their destination, drivers sometimes get stuck holding the bag. Many Indonesians don’t have bank accounts, and the e-commerce companies allow shoppers to pay for items in cash upon delivery.</p><p>Yudha, 24, who runs a cargo delivery center near Lampung, said one customer had denied ever ordering the package he delivered, which was worth almost a whole month’s pay, about $100. “I had to carry it back and request the return myself,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/00INDONESIA-DELIVERY-12-plqc/00INDONESIA-DELIVERY-12-plqc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/00INDONESIA-DELIVERY-12-plqc/00INDONESIA-DELIVERY-12-plqc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/00INDONESIA-DELIVERY-12-plqc/00INDONESIA-DELIVERY-12-plqc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A port with trucks and ships against a mountainous background." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/00INDONESIA-DELIVERY-12-plqc/00INDONESIA-DELIVERY-12-plqc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/00INDONESIA-DELIVERY-12-plqc/00INDONESIA-DELIVERY-12-plqc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/00INDONESIA-DELIVERY-12-plqc/00INDONESIA-DELIVERY-12-plqc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/00INDONESIA-DELIVERY-12-plqc/00INDONESIA-DELIVERY-12-plqc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/76a5081a-d04b-5c49-a0d0-66af99b6f107" decoding="async" width="600" height="450"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Trucks wait to make the slow ferry crossing to Sumatra from the Port of Merak on Java.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Danu, 28, a supervisor at another J&amp;T Express branch in Lampung, said his colleagues used to stack the next day’s deliveries on the sidewalk outside their office for easy pick up.
