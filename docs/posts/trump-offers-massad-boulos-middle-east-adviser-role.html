    <h1>Trump Offers Massad Boulos Middle East Adviser Role</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Before the election last month, Mr. Boulos played a major unofficial role in the Trump campaign, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign-michigan-arab-americans.html" title="">courting Arab American voters</a> who Republican strategists hoped would support Mr. Trump out of frustration with President Biden’s support for Israel. Despite Mr. Trump’s own defiantly pro-Israel policies during his first term as president, Mr. Boulos worked to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/trump-arab-american-jews.html" title="">build support</a> for him in heavily Arab American and Muslim corners of Michigan.</p><p>Through his connection to the Trump family, Mr. Boulos has already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/world/middleeast/trump-palestinians-abbas-gaza-war.html" title="">served as something of an informal liaison</a> between Mr. Trump and Middle Eastern leaders. In September, Mr. Boulos met with Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. He also helped deliver a letter from Mr. Abbas to Mr. Trump in July, in which Mr. Abbas wished Mr. Trump well after an attempted assassination that month.</p><p>While Mr. Boulos has offered few details publicly about how he would approach such an expansive role in the White House, the position could prove influential. The incoming Trump administration could be faced with maintaining a cease-fire between Israel and Lebanon, managing a humanitarian crisis in Gaza caused by more than a year of war between Israel and Hamas and dealing with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/middleeast/syria-war-aleppo-rebels-government.html" title="">sudden instability in Syria</a> after rebel forces made startling gains this weekend.</p><p>As president, Mr. Trump put forth a number of disruptive policies favoring Israel that often alienated other Middle Eastern leaders. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/middleeast/trump-jerusalem-israel-capital.html" title="">recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel</a> and moved the U.S. embassy there, cut aid to the United Nations agency that supports Palestinian refugees and proposed a number of agreements between Israel and Arab states that left out provisions aimed at securing Palestinian statehood.</p><p>Mr. Boulos’s political connections to leaders in Lebanon are also somewhat murky. According to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-arab-americans-michigan-boulos-gaza-war-57abe06681457106a2e6ab107407edc6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reporting by The Associated Press</a> and several Lebanese outlets, Mr. Boulos sought a seat in Lebanon’s Parliament in 2009 and described himself as a “friend” of a Lebanese presidential candidate who had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hezbollah-nasrallah-president-frangieh-lebanon-658ff1d65764ec2941d4af1ae8d1b42e" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">received support</a> from the militant group Hezbollah.</p></div></div>
