Ames, who had worked for the Ohio Department of Youth Services, which oversees parts of the state’s juvenile corrections system. After a decade there, in 2014 she became the administrator of a program addressing prison rape. Five years later, she applied for a promotion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Her supervisors turned her down, saying she lacked vision and leadership skills. They eventually gave the position to a gay woman who had been at the department for a shorter time and, unlike Ms. Ames, lacked a college degree.</p><p>Not long after denying her the new position, her supervisors removed her from her existing job, telling her that they had concerns about her leadership and offering her a demotion that came with a substantial pay cut. She was replaced by a gay man with less seniority.</p><p>Ms. Ames sued under a federal civil rights law that forbids employment discrimination based on, among other characteristics, sex. (The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ruled in 2020</a> that discrimination based on sexual orientation is a form of sex discrimination for purposes of the civil rights law.)</p><p>The text of the law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, does not draw distinctions based on whether the person claiming discrimination is a member of a majority group. But some courts have required plaintiffs from majority groups to prove an additional element if they lack direct evidence of discrimination: “background circumstances that support the suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.”</p><p>Lower courts <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1039/301118/20240222113046573_23-__%20Ames%20App%20for%20Extension%20and%20Exhibits%20Combined.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ruled against Ms. Ames</a> on those grounds. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, said she could have satisfied the “background circumstances” requirement by showing that decisions about her employment were made by “a member of the relevant minority group (here, gay people)” or with statistical evidence. But the appeals court said Ms. Ames had provided neither kind of proof.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>(In the trial court, she said the two supervisors who took negative employment actions against her were straight. On appeal, she said a gay supervisor had also played a role. The appeals court ruled that she had forfeited that argument by not making it sooner.)</p><p>Conservative legal groups had championed Ms. Ames’s case, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/23-1039.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services</a>, No. 23-1039. The Biden administration also supported her argument, filing <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1039/335322/20241216192608136_23-1039_Ames_Amicus_Brief_iso_Vacatur.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a brief supporting Ms. Ames</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Liptak covers the Supreme Court and writes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/sidebar">Sidebar,</a> a column on legal developments.
