The two have battled over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/world/americas/brazil-x-ban-free-speech.html" title="">what can be said on X</a>, with Justice Moraes arguing that certain accounts were illegally attacking Brazilian institutions and Mr. Musk responding that the judge was illegally censoring voices. The social network <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/world/americas/brazil-x-ban-business-community.html" title="">remains blocked</a> in Brazil. </p><p>Justice Moraes determined that Starlink could be responsible for X’s fines because they were from the same “de facto economic group.” Some legal experts in Brazil questioned that interpretation, but the court said the two companies had missed the deadline to appeal.</p><p>Starlink had asked the court to unfreeze its assets, but another Brazilian Supreme Court justice quickly <a href="https://noticias.stf.jus.br/postsnoticias/stf-rejeita-acao-contra-bloqueio-de-contas-da-starlink/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rejected the request</a>.</p><p>Mr. Musk called the move to freeze Starlink’s assets “absolutely illegal,” noting that Starlink is owned by the private space company SpaceX.
