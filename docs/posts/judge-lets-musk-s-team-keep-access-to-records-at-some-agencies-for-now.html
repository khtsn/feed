Bates of the Federal District Court in Washington wrote that he had grave concerns about the privacy issues raised by the case, particularly because the data in question “includes information on all Americans who rely on Medicare and Medicaid, as well as countless consumers.”</p><p>But, he added, the case made by the plaintiffs — led by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/business/economy/afl-cio-seiu-labor-union-alliance.html" title="">the A.F.L.-C.I.O.</a>, an umbrella group of unions that represent many federal workers — did not meet the high legal bar necessary for him to immediately block the initiative’s access while the case proceeded.</p><p>“The record indicates,” Judge Bates wrote, that members of Mr. Musk’s team are federal employees “who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The ruling was a victory for the Trump administration and Mr. Musk in their efforts to scrutinize the activities and spending of federal agencies, which have faced several setbacks in the courts. For example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/nyregion/attorneys-general-trump-musk-suit.html" title="">DOGE’s access to the Treasury Department’s payment and data systems</a> was halted by a federal judge last week.</p><p>Unions representing federal workers, like the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/elon-musk-treasury-payment-data.html" title="">American Federation of Government Employees</a>, have led many of the lawsuits against the Trump administration.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Chris Cameron covers politics for The Times, focusing on breaking news and the 2024 campaign.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/chris-cameron">More about Chris Cameron</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/american-federation-of-laborcongress-of-industrial-organizations">American Federation of Labor</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/bureau-of-consumer-financial-protection-cfpb">Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (C.F.P.B.)</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/health-and-human-services-department">Health and Human Services Department</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/labor-department-us">Labor Department, U.S.</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
