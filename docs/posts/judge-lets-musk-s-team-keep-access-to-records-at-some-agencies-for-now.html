Bates of the Federal District Court in Washington wrote that he had grave concerns about the privacy issues raised by the case, particularly because the data in question “includes information on all Americans who rely on Medicare and Medicaid, as well as countless consumers.”</p><p>But, he added, the case made by the plaintiffs — led by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/business/economy/afl-cio-seiu-labor-union-alliance.html" title="">the A.F.L.-C.I.O.</a>, an umbrella group of unions that represent many federal workers — did not meet the high legal bar necessary for him to immediately block the initiative’s access while the case proceeded.</p><p>“The record indicates,” Judge Bates wrote, that members of Mr. Musk’s team are federal employees “who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
