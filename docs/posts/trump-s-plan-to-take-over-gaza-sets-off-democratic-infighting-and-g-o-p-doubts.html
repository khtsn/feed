Politicians and activists traded attacks and fought over whether this vision squared with Mr. Trump’s “America First” brand, which has always revolved around his promise to extricate the nation from foreign wars.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>From the right, Mr. Trump received perhaps the sharpest Republican pushback of his nascent presidency, which has so far been defined by his party’s complete fealty to him. Some anti-interventionist lawmakers like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky <a href="https://x.com/RandPaul/status/1887114985383367065" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bristled at the idea</a>. More hawkish leaders, <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2025/02/trumps-gaza-takeover-plan-met-with-bafflement-skepticism-from-senate-lawmakers/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">like Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina</a>, suggested that the proposal might simply be a nonstarter.</p><p>And on the left, some Democrats criticized the Arab and Muslim Americans, progressives and others who opposed Vice President Kamala Harris in protest of the Biden administration’s support for Israel — “is <em>this</em> what you wanted?” the argument went — as others vigorously defended that choice.</p><p>James Zogby, a member of the Democratic National Committee and a founder of the Arab American Institute, was unsparing toward those who advocated a protest vote.</p><p>“There was a need to recognize the danger of Trump and some folks in my community, some hustlers, were deliberately deluding themselves and others into thinking this was actually going to be a protest vote,” Mr. Zogby said. “It was a vote for suicide. They were helping to drive the car off the cliff and taking the community and the country with them.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A protest during the Democratic convention in Chicago last summer over the Biden-Harris administration’s Mideast policy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jon Cherry for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>But in interviews on Wednesday, several Arab and Muslim American leaders or activists who voted for Mr. Trump stood by him.

Mr. Trump, he added, “is willing to take the risk.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Katie Glueck is a Times national political reporter.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katie-glueck">More about Katie Glueck</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>Lisa Lerer is a national political reporter for The Times, based in New York.
