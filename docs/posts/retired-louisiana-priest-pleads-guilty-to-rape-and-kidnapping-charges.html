The charges came after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/07/us/louisiana-priest-lawrence-hecker-sex-abuse.html" title="">allegations surfaced last year</a> that the Archdiocese of New Orleans had known about accusations against Mr. Hecker for decades.</p><p>“Him ultimately taking responsibility for it was the right thing to do, and the necessary thing to do at this point,” Mr. Hjortsberg said. “I hope everybody involved can move forward in whatever way is best for them.”</p><p>The guilty plea did not include a plea deal, Mr. Hjortsberg said. Mr. Hecker is set to be sentenced on Dec. 18, and he faces life in prison.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Hecker’s trial had been delayed multiple times over concerns about his mental competency, and because the judge recused himself over a conflict with prosecutors. The new judge, Nandi Campbell of the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court, ordered Mr. Hecker to undergo physical and psychological evaluations before trial. Mr. Hjortsberg confirmed that the retired priest had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and dementia.</p><p>The charges against Mr. Hecker <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/20/new-orleans-priest-lawrence-hecker-child-abuse" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">came months after The Guardian reported</a> that he confessed to his superiors in 1999 that he had sexually molested or committed other forms of sexual misconduct against multiple teenagers in the 1960s and ’70s. Mr. Hecker later confirmed to The Guardian and the New Orleans news outlet WWL-TV that he had committed “overtly sexual acts” with at least three underage boys.</p><p>Mr. Hecker continued to serve with the New Orleans archdiocese until his retirement in 2002. But the archdiocese did not publicly identify him as an accused sexual predator until 2018, when it released a list of “credibly accused” priests.</p><p>Thousands of Catholic priests have been accused of misconduct since the sexual abuse crisis in the American Catholic Church exploded into public view in the early 2000s. But relatively few have faced criminal prosecution. In September, a Catholic priest in Texas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/us/waco-texas-priest-sexual-assault.html" title="">was indicted on felony sexual assault charges</a> after several victims accused him of sexual and financial abuse.</p><p>The New Orleans archdiocese filed for bankruptcy in 2020 amid a flood of abuse claims, and it is among about a dozen dioceses and archdioceses that are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/21/us/archdiocese-bankruptcy-san-francisco.html" title="">currently in bankruptcy proceedings</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In a statement on Tuesday after Mr. Hecker’s guilty plea, a spokesman for the archdiocese said that it was the church’s “hope and prayer that today’s court proceedings bring healing and peace to the survivor and all survivors of sexual abuse.”</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
