<p>The series began on Pearl, the map pick from MIBR GC, as the team ran a double-Initiator comp with Tejo and KAY/O. Instead of that idea, Shopify Gold ran double-Initiator with Sova, which was previously a rare pick for the map. Shopify Gold won the pistol, and despite losing the bonus round, were in complete control of the map. Even when the team made mistakes on its first attempt on a site, like on round six, the calling from <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/3063/mel">
		meL	</a>
</span> was immaculate.</p>


<p><em>meL perfectly evens the numbers with a late call to B site.</em></p>

<p>Noia landed a three-man spray just after to keep the momentum going, and Shopify Gold kept rolling to an 11-1 lead. When Shopify Gold earned the second pistol thanks to a <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/9185/dodonut">
		dodonut	</a>
</span> triple, the map came down to two teams force-buying. Both Noia and dodonut ended any hope of MIBR making the score better, as the map ended 13-1.</p>

<p>Corrode was next, and MIBR needed to perform better, but this time on the opponent&#39;s map pick. MIBR opted for a double-Duelist composition with Yoru and Waylay, while Shopify Gold ran double-Controller with Omen and Viper. Just like Pearl, Shopify continued the pistol round wins, but this time, the bonus loss was not the only round loss of the map. The Waylay and Yoru utility did prove to cause some trouble for Shopify, as MIBR entered the half up 7-5.</p>

<p>However, now came the tough part for the composition that MIBR GC ran: the defense. MIBR won its first pistol round of the series with some clean shots from <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/31574/srn">
		srN	</a>
</span>, but when the team lost the bonus round, Shopify immediately went on a run to tie the game and take a 10-9 lead. Both dodonut on Waylay and <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/17397/noia">
		Noia	</a>
</span> on Viper were causing trouble for MIBR, as a 10-10 tie proved to be the last round victory for MIBR GC in the series. Shopify Gold won the next three rounds to win the map 13-10, and the series 2-0.</p>

<p>Noia was the best player across both teams, top fragging on both maps as Killjoy and Viper. They ended the series with a 1.60 rating, 35 kills, 164 ADR, and 259 ACS.</p>

<p>With this win, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/581492/shopify-rebellion-gold-vs-karmine-corp-gc-game-changers-2025-championship-seoul-ubsf" target="_blank">Shopify Rebellion Gold will face Karmine Corp GC</a> in the upper bracket semifinals to keep its three-peat hopes alive. As for MIBR GC, the team is sent to the lower bracket and will face <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/581498/mibr-gc-vs-tbd-game-changers-2025-championship-seoul-lr2" target="_blank">the victor of the Xipto Esports GC and Ninetails match</a>.</p>
