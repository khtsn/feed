The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Mr. Baldoni; the film’s lead producer, Jamey Heath; their production company, Wayfarer Studios; and the publicists Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel. They are seeking $400 million in damages.</p><p>Representatives for Ms. Lively’s team did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The New York Times published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/business/media/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us.html" title="">an article</a> on Dec. 21 about Ms. Lively’s allegations against Mr. Baldoni. She claimed in a complaint, filed a day earlier with the California Civil Rights Department, that Mr. Baldoni had initiated the campaign after she accused him of sexual harassment during the shooting of “It Ends With Us.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Times report referred to private text messages and emails that Ms. Lively had obtained through a subpoena and that had been included in her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/21/us/complaint-of-blake-lively-v-wayfarer-studios-llc-et-al.html" title="">complaint</a>.</p><p>The complaint alleged that the messages showed Mr. Baldoni and his business partner, Mr. Heath, working with a crisis public relations expert to tarnish Ms. Lively’s reputation because they were afraid the misconduct claims would become public. Ms. Lively sued Mr. Baldoni and others on Dec. 31 in federal court in New York City.</p><p>That same day, Mr. Baldoni filed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/us/justin-baldoni-blake-lively-it-ends-with-us-new-york-times-lawsuit.html" title="">a defamation lawsuit against The New York Times</a> in Los Angeles, accusing the newspaper of relying on Ms. Lively’s “unverified and self-serving narrative.” He repeated some of the claims against the publication in the suit he filed on Thursday.</p><p>The Times has said it plans to vigorously defend itself against Mr. Baldoni’s claims against the publication. A Times spokeswoman, Danielle Rhoades Ha, added in a statement on Thursday: “The allegations against The New York Times in this new lawsuit are meritless and recycled from the equally baseless claims in the suit that was filed against The Times in California.”</p><p>In his countersuit against Ms. Lively, Mr. Baldoni said the actress had used her star power to hijack “every aspect” of his film and then tried to blame him when her public reputation took a hit during the film’s promotion for how she chose to market it. He accused her of trying to make him “the real-life villain in her story” and of colluding with The Times to “prepare a false and damaging narrative.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“This is a case about two of the most powerful stars in the world deploying their enormous power to steal an entire film right out of the hands of its director and production studio,” the lawsuit said. “Then, when Lively and Reynolds’s efforts failed to win them the acclaim they believed they so richly deserved, they turned their fury on their chosen scapegoat.”</p><p>Mr. Baldoni denied that the alleged sexual harassment of Ms. Lively or the smear campaign against her had happened, and said he was the one who had been the victim of such a campaign.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
