We hope not, and would be glad if the threat does not materialize. But as close observers of people and places where democracy has come under pressure and occasionally buckled, we see creeping autocracy as a distinct and under-discussed possibility. We know well other nations, including Hungary and Poland, where leaders have steered policies that lead to a backsliding of democracy. We see eerie similarities between what transpired in those countries and what Mr. Trump and his transition team have already done and promise to do.</p><p>Fortunately, we also have examples of countries that have pushed back on threats to democracy, and we can learn from them.</p><p>The Trump transition has featured the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/politics/trump-administration-cabinet-appointees.html" title="">rapid-fire appointments</a> of several cabinet officials who are both unqualified and potentially dangerous to the security and health of the American people. The transition has also included a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/business/media/trump-defamation-lawsuit-abc-hegseth-cnn.html" title="">flurry of actual and threatened libel actions</a> against critics, followed by several media executives and owners caving in.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Business leaders with economic interests dependent on the federal government have also made nice with the president-elect, who has threatened to <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2024/11/01/trump-has-stopped-even-pretending-he-would-fight-corporate-power/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">use his regulatory power to pick favorites</a>.</p><p>In a second term, Mr. Trump’s actions may be even more dangerous because he is now following the playbook created by Viktor Orbán, the prime minister of Hungary, who after losing and then regaining office moved his country from a democracy into an “illiberal state,” as he <a href="https://budapestbeacon.com/full-text-of-viktor-orbans-speech-at-baile-tusnad-tusnadfurdo-of-26-july-2014/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">put</a> it. It was one of the <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/nations-transit/2020/dropping-democratic-facade" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">faster collapses of a robust democracy</a> on record.</p><p>As we have seen in others democracies, autocracy is not built out of the whims of a leader but only becomes entrenched when it has been certified by legalism — exploiting legal means to serve autocratic ends. After Mr. Orbán paid <a href="https://www.hungarianconservative.com/articles/current/viktor-orban-donald-trump-elon-musk-mar-a-lago-visit/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his third visit of 2024 to Mar-a-Lago</a> in early December, and after <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/viktor-orban-mission-to-elect-trump/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">revelations</a> that Mr. Orbán’s people were involved in <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/179776/heritage-foundation-viktor-orban-trump" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">influencing policy in Mr. Trump’s second term</a>, Mr. Trump’s affinity for the Orbán playbook should not be surprising.</p><p>Mr. Orbán used law as a weapon against Hungarian democracy. When he came to power in 2010, he unleashed a <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/480981" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pack of laws</a> designed to bring the courts to heel and to scare the media and political opposition into submission. He <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://bibliotekanauki.pl/articles/942413.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiwnobfnLSKAxUUhIkEHcE6Dlc4FBAWegQIJBAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw1c0_1H5o1zNCLFR-luRaZD" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">consolidated power</a> in an ever-expanding Office of the Prime Minister, bypassing his cabinet and giving orders directly to the bureaucracy, which he had reconstructed by <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/hungary-and-end-politics/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">changing the civil service law</a> to fire those who were not already on his team and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/democratic-backsliding-and-public-administration/illiberal-transformation-of-government-bureaucracy-in-a-fragile-democracy-the-case-of-hungary/DC201AB9ED63FE4D93996AF41294ABDD" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">elevate allies to key positions</a>. Mr. Orbán’s rise to power was accompanied by the <a href="https://ipi.media/publications/civil-defamation-and-media-freedom-in-hungary/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">aggressive use of libel actions</a> to drain the resources of critics and to chill the aspirations of new challengers. He <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/10/first-lets-pick-all-the-judges/" title="">packed the courts</a> with loyalists.</p><p>Mr. Trump promises to do much the same, including through his embrace of Project 2025 ideas and their proponents, many of whom are populating his administration. Project 2025 lays out a <a href="https://www.project2025.org/playbook/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">180-day playbook</a> for capturing government quickly, using legal tools.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The plan envisions a bulked-up White House Office and Executive Office of the President of the United States embracing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/us/politics/unitary-executive-executive-power.html" title="">unitary executive theory</a> that “it is the President’s agenda<em> </em>that should matter to the departments and agencies that operate under his constitutional authority.” Project 2025 then relies on reinstating Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-creating-schedule-f-excepted-service/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2020 executive order</a> creating Schedule F, which permits the reclassification of civil service positions as at-will jobs so that the president can remove bureaucrats who are not on his team.</p><p>Even before Mr. Trump’s appointees have entered their designated offices, however, Mr. Trump and his admirers have launched <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/business/media/trump-defamation-lawsuit-abc-hegseth-cnn.html" title="">libel cases</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/kash-patel-wants-trumps-critics-criminally-investigated/2024/12/18/ccf06648-fa80-40f8-b6e6-e7cec626025a_video.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">threats of criminal investigation</a> to intimidate journalists and political opponents, just as Mr. Orbán did. ABC News just settled one such case for $15 million rather than risk the cost and Trumpian ire of defending its journalist. Mr. Trump has made no secret of wanting to weaken the landmark Supreme Court case <a href="https://spectator.org/trump-takes-aim-at-new-york-times-v-sullivan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New York Times v. Sullivan</a>, which creates a high bar for proving libel against public officials. (In 2014, Mr. Orbán’s government <a href="https://ipi.media/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Hungary-Civil-Defamation-web-small-2.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">changed the country’s libel law</a> to make it easier for public officials to win libel cases after a constitutional amendment nullified the <a href="https://public.mkab.hu/dev/dontesek.nsf/0/e2af731c9711a97fc1257ada0052a5d3/$FILE/en_0036_1994.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hungarian Constitutional Court</a> decision to the contrary.)</p><p>By entering office with a blitz of legislation and outrageous policy proposals in 2010, Mr. Orbán divided the opposition. Those who cared about <a href="http://medialaws.ceu.hu/about.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">media freedom</a> embraced one set of initiatives; those who worried about <a href="https://hclu.hu/en/articles/hclu-the-hungarian-example-1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">judicial independence</a> started another; <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/lib-docs/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/session11/HU/HHC_HungarianHelsinskiCommittee-eng.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">still others</a> focused on prisoners and migrants. Crucially, the opposition <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/world/europe/rare-opposition-protests-in-hungary.html" title="">only rarely united</a> when faced with attacks on multiple fronts.</p><p>Mr. Trump is already using this tactic of flooding the zone with legal challenges designed to divide and conquer his opposition. His political opposition may be next. Strongly united during the presidential campaign, it must take care not to splinter. Some are prioritizing the coming fight against mass deportations; others are doubling down on trans rights; attorneys are focusing on protecting the Justice Department from bringing wrongful prosecutions against Mr. Trump’s political opponents (and responding if it happens); former judges are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/opinion/judges-trump-rule-of-law.html" title="">focused</a> on judicial decision-making and appointments if the rule of law comes under attack.</p><p>But the unified purpose and energy that dominated the presidential campaign must be maintained, making political opposition resistant to a divide-and-conquer strategy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Lessons from other attempts at autocratic takeover provide more guidance for democratic self-defense.</p><p>In Poland, where the Law and Justice government also <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/poland/nations-transit/2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cemented</a> its power by law using the Orbán playbook, masses of Polish citizens <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/thousands-protest-against-polands-plan-to-discipline-judges-idUSKBN1ZA0PC/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">went to the streets</a> demanding protection of the judiciary. When the next election neared, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2024.2346436#abstract" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opposition parties</a> set aside their differences to establish a campaign that focused on the threats to constitutional democracy. They won, albeit narrowly, in 2023.</p><p>But the Polish electoral victory also shows how hard it is to un-entrench a government that has entrenched itself by law. With the holdover Law and Justice-affiliated president <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/how-donald-tusk-can-get-around-polands-president/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blocking new legislation</a> with his veto and the packed Constitutional Tribunal <a href="https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/12/15/constitutional-court-blocks-new-polish-government-from-making-changes-to-public-media/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overturning other initiatives</a>, the government that ran on a platform of restoring democracy can barely make headway and is already <a href="https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/12/13/most-poles-negatively-assess-work-of-tusk-government-after-one-year-in-power/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">falling in the polls</a> because it looks ineffective.</p><p>The lesson Poland teaches us is that would-be autocrats can be pushed back if the opposition is united, but also that a country stands a better chance of recovery if it blocks autocracy before it becomes legally entrenched. As in Poland, Mr. Trump was able to solidify a clear majority at the Supreme Court during his first term, and its rulings contributed to the delay for any possible reckoning by a federal court for his conduct.</p><p>In Brazil, where Jair Bolsonaro ruled like Mr. Trump with whim and revenge, the 2022 election narrowly toppled him, after he cast doubt on the process.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But because Mr. Bolsonaro, like Mr. Trump, did not fully entrench himself by law in his first term, the still independent Supreme Federal Court was able to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-66070923" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">disqualify Mr. Bolsonaro</a> from running for office for eight years, and the still-independent federal prosecutors are now examining overwhelming evidence that he had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/27/jair-bolsonaro-coup" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">planned a coup</a>. Here, too, however, democratic recovery depends on crucial institutions remaining independent and not packed with loyalists during the period of attempted autocratic capture.</p><p>Defenders of democracy will have to stay united, focusing on ensuring that checks and balances remain intact and that crucial democratic watchdog institutions elude capture. Otherwise, America will indeed find itself sleepwalking into autocracy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Kim Lane Scheppele, a professor of sociology and international affairs at Princeton University, lived and worked in Hungary for many years as a researcher at the Hungarian Constitutional Court and at Central European University.
