But they are also divided over free speech — with potentially far-reaching implications for how the digital world is regulated.</p><p>The E.U. has been investigating U.S. companies under the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Digital Services Act</a>, a new law meant to prevent illegal content and disinformation from spreading online. In the first major case to near a conclusion, regulators as soon as this summer are expected to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/technology/eu-penalties-x-elon-musk.html" title="">impose</a> significant penalties — including a fine and demands for product changes — on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/business/eu-investigation-x-musk.html" title="">Elon Musk’s social media platform, X</a>, saying the law was violated.</p><p>But Mr. Trump’s administration sees the law as a strike against his version of free speech: One that unshackles his allies to say what they want online, but restricts types of expression he does not agree with in the real world, like protests at universities.</p><p>The president <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qJC92chfls" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has argued</a> that Europe is at risk of “losing their wonderful right to freedom of speech.” Vice President JD Vance has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/us/politics/vance-far-right-germany-munich-afd.html" title="">accused</a> European nations of “digital censorship” because of its laws, which he argues restricts far-right voices on the internet.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And both administration officials and their allies at big technology companies have suggested that Europe’s rules for curbing disinformation and incendiary speech on the internet are an attack on American companies — one that the United States could fight back against.</p><p>Since Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Europe and the United States have clashed repeatedly. On Ukraine, Mr. Trump has dialed back support and threatened <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/trump-casts-doubt-on-nato-commitments-as-world-leaders-reconsider-sharing-intel-with-u-s-233691717720" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not to defend</a> European nations that do not invest enough in their own security. On trade, Mr. Trump this week announced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/world/europe/trump-tariffs-reciprocal-reaction-trade-war.html" title="">wide-ranging tariffs</a> on Europe. And as European regulators begin to enforce their new social media rules, free speech is becoming another flashpoint.</p><p>“We’re now at this impasse: The free speech debate is affecting every aspect of the trans-Atlantic relationship,” said David Salvo, a researcher at the German Marshall Fund who is an expert in democracy building. “It’s a mess.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>X’s European headquarters, in Dublin.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Even before the 2024 election, Mr. Vance argued in a podcast that America could consider tying its support for NATO to “respect” for American values and free speech. In February, Mr. Vance <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/world/europe/vance-europe-immigration-ukraine.html" title="">spoke</a> at the security conference in Munich and warned that “free speech, I fear, is in retreat.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Such comments come even as the American administration has itself <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/nyregion/columbia-trump-administration-funding-fight.html" title="">quarreled with</a> universities over speech on their campuses, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/nyregion/ice-arrests-palestinian-activist-columbia-protests.html" title="">arrested pro-Palestinian activists</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/politics/trump-white-house-press-policy.html" title="">ousted journalists</a> from the White House press pool, canceled identity-related holidays at federal institutions and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/trump-executive-orders-local-control-schools.html" title="">instituted policies</a> that led to banned books in certain schools — moves that have alarmed free speech <a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/watchlist-march-2025/USA/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">watchdogs</a>.</p><p>And in Europe, officials have firmly objected to criticism of their laws, arguing that they help protect free speech, for instance by making sure that some ideas are not secretly promoted by platforms even as others are suppressed.</p><p>“We’re not a Ministry of Truth,” said Thomas Regnier, a spokesman for the European Union’s executive branch, the European Commission, referring to the dystopian force responsible for state propaganda in George Orwell’s “1984.”</p><p>Still, some fret that Europe’s latest policies surrounding digital services could come under attack. In February, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-issues-directive-to-prevent-the-unfair-exploitation-of-american-innovation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published a memo</a> warning that E.U. tech laws were being scrutinized for unfairly targeting American companies.</p><p>“Of course our feeling is that they will use tariffs to push us to backtrack on tech regulation,” said Anna Cavazzini, a German representative from the Green party who was part of a trip to Washington for European lawmakers to meet with their American counterparts on the issues of digital policy and speech.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The tension goes back decades. Europe has long preferred more guardrails for speech, while America prioritizes personal rights over almost everything but <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/supreme-court-case-library/schenck-v-united-states#:~:text=In%20Schenck%20v.,conflict%20with%20the%20First%20Amendment." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">immediate public</a> safety. Germany has outlawed certain speech related to Nazism, while other countries restrict certain forms of hate speech toward religious groups. In Denmark, it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/07/world/europe/denmark-quran-burning-ban.html" title="">illegal</a> to burn the Quran.</p><p>But while those nuanced differences have long existed, the internet and social media have now made the issue a geopolitical pressure point.

European courts <a href="https://academic.oup.com/hrlr/article/14/4/761/644686" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have upheld</a> the idea that data about a person can be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/technology/right-to-be-forgotten-law-europe.html" title="">erased from the internet</a>, the so-called “right to be forgotten.” American legal experts and policymakers have viewed that as an infringement on free speech.</p><p>But the alliance between Mr. Trump and big technology companies — which have been emboldened by his election — is widening the gap.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>European officials have vowed that the Trump administration will not prevent them from standing by their values and enforcing their new legislation.
