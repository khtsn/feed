</span> have <a href="https://x.com/Sentinels/status/1983232664669958174" target="_blank">released</a> long-time player <span data-ref-id="1">Jordan		&#34;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/729/zellsis">Zellsis</a>&#34;
		Montemurro</span> after more than two years with the organization.</p>

<p>This is a major change for Sentinels, with Zellsis having acted as a face of the team for the past two years. Apart from his outward personality and incessant sale of the Sentinels bundle, He has also become known as a major emotional leader of the team, with former teammates speaking to the impact and care he has for the team.</p>

<p>When Zellsis <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/273817/zellsis-returns-to-sentinels-as-sixth-man" target="_blank">began his second stint</a> with Sentinels in 2024, he planned to do so not as a starting player, but as a substitute. However, his time to hit the stage came sooner than expected when <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/683/pancada">
		pANcada	</a>
</span> fell ill and was forced to sit out during portions of the off season. Zellsis&#39; impact on the server became immediately apparent, as the previously struggling team turned around and dominated the entire off season. This included wins at the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1868/sentinels-invitational/playoffs" target="_blank">Sentinels Invitational</a> and at the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1763/afreecatv-valorant-league/playoffs" target="_blank">AfreecaTV Valorant League</a> tournament against the likes of <span data-ref-id="3">

<p>With his performance in the off season, Zellsis became a permanent member of Sentinels&#39; starting roster, and pANcada moved to the role of sixth man. Having shown their potential, Sentinels did not disappoint heading into the VCT season. They found immediate success, taking home the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1923/champions-tour-2024-americas-kickoff" target="_blank">Americas Kickoff</a> title, and even winning <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1921/champions-tour-2024-masters-madrid" target="_blank">Masters Madrid</a>, crowning Zellsis a champion for the first time. They also capped off the season with a respectable top four finish at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2097/valorant-champions-2024" target="_blank">Champions</a>.</p>

</span> after 2024, the 2025 season was a bit more tumultuous for Sentinels, but they still remained as a top team in Americas, qualifying to all three international events. However, with a bottom four exit at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025/group-stage" target="_blank">Champions</a> this year, Sentinels is undergoing a roster reconstruction for 2026, having already <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/575624/sentinels-offseason-kicks-off-with-bangs-release" target="_blank">released</a> <span data-ref-id="8">
