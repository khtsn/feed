It had been only a few months since Dostoyevsky had played his first round of roulette at the casino in Wiesbaden, Germany, and already he had cycled several times through a sequence known to gamblers everywhere: Win big, and then lose bigger.</p><p>In the years that followed, Dostoyevsky traveled frequently between the flourishing German spa towns of Baden-Baden, Bad Homburg and Wiesbaden, trying his luck again and again in their opulent casinos, a stomping ground for Europe’s aristocracy. By 1866, he had entered into a perilous wager with his publisher to avoid debtor’s prison: Deliver a new novel by Nov. 1 or lose the publishing rights to his entire catalog.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/28/travel/00Dostoyevsky-historical/00Dostoyevsky-historical-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/28/travel/00Dostoyevsky-historical/00Dostoyevsky-historical-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/28/travel/00Dostoyevsky-historical/00Dostoyevsky-historical-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="An old black-and-white photograph from the 1860s shows a man with a beard seated against a blank wall, with a column on one side.

The novel follows Alexei Ivanovich, a young Russian tutor who travels with an imperious general to the fictitious German town of Roulettenburg and spirals into compulsive gambling.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>His only book set primarily in Germany, “The Gambler” is in many ways a repository for the acerbic disparagements of a writer who had a love-hate relationship with the country. “I sit brooding in this melancholy little town,” says Alexei, the book’s narrator, “and how melancholy the little towns of Germany can be!”</p><p>Though modeled most closely on Wiesbaden, Roulettenburg is most likely a composite of the three spa towns where Dostoyevsky gambled — and lost. Baden-Baden is still a tourist destination, but none of them are the hot spots they once were. Although they long remained popular with Russians, that all changed when Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 led to increased travel restrictions.</p><p>An admirer of Dostoyevsky’s work, I first read his books as a teenager, and then again while living in Moscow a decade ago. As a longtime expat living in Berlin — someone who has occasionally felt out of place in Germany — I am particularly drawn to “The Gambler,” which is told through the eyes of another out-of-place foreigner. I also wanted to see what remained of the once grand spa towns he described at a time when the aristocracy traveled across Europe to “take the waters,” to see and be seen.</p><p>And so last fall, I caught a train south in search of Dostoyevsky’s Roulettenburg.</p><h2 id="link-85b0cc7">Wiesbaden: A hot spot for Russian nobility</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Wiesbaden, the present <a href="https://kurhaus.wiesbaden.de/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kurhaus</a>, a neo-Classical spa structure, was built in the early 20th century.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Felix Schmitt for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>On the right bank of the Rhine, Wiesbaden reached its heyday in the late 19th century after its annexation by Prussia led to its rise as an international spa town, popular especially with the Russian nobility.

The casino inside bears little resemblance to the one where Dostoyevsky gambled, aside from an original roulette wheel enclosed under glass. But it wasn’t hard to draw a connection between the affluent players lazily staking bets and the gambling gentlemen Dostoyevsky depicts, who bet “only for amusement, only to watch the process of winning or losing. …”</p><p>After losing a small amount of money myself, I went looking for the most Wiesbaden of dinners, which I found up in the hills at <a href="https://www.apfelweinstube-im-himmelreich.de/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apfelweinstube im Himmelreich,</a> or Apple Wine Tavern in the Heavens.
