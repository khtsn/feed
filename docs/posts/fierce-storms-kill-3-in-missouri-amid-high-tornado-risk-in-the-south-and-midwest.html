From the afternoon into the evening, the storms are expected to sweep across Alabama and maybe into Tennessee before crossing into Georgia and northern Florida overnight.</p><p>According to the Storm Prediction Center, Saturday is likely to be the third time in history that the center has issued a high-risk warning on the second day of a storm.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Central Mississippi and Alabama face the highest risk level, five, in the center’s rating system. The Gulf Coast states and Georgia face a high risk level of four on Saturday.</p><p>Storms at this highest level of alert can often produce intense long-track tornadoes, meaning they stay on the ground for a very long time. A slow storm will typically only affect one or two communities, but a faster-moving storm such as this one can cross multiple states, leaving a long trail of damage.</p><p>Forecasters doubled down on their language on Saturday, saying they believed there was a high risk of violent, long-track tornadoes in the South.</p><p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency warned of excessive rainfall and flash flooding in the Southeast “with numerous significant tornadoes expected on Saturday afternoon and evening.”</p><p>The Storm Prediction Center received 23 reports of tornadoes since Friday across Arkansas, Illinois, Mississippi and Missouri, according to the FEMA, as well as nearly a dozen reports of hurricane-force winds.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In Missouri, tornado damage was reported in Bridgeton, Morse Mill, Perryville and Poplar Bluff, according to FEMA.
