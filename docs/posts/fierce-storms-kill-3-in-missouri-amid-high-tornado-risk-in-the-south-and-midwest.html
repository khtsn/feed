They have the potential to form numerous significant tornadoes, some of which could be potentially violent, damaging hurricane-force (greater than 74 miles per hour) winds and golf-ball- or even baseball-size hail.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A tractor-trailer overturned in high winds near Villa Ridge, Mo.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>According to the Storm Prediction Center, Saturday is likely to be the third time in history that the center has issued a high-risk warning on the second day of a storm. Central Mississippi and Alabama face the highest risk level, five, in the center’s rating system. The Gulf Coast states and Georgia face a high risk level of four on Saturday.</p><p>Storms at this highest level of alert can often produce intense long-track tornadoes, meaning they stay on the ground for a very long time. A slow storm will typically only affect one or two communities, but a faster-moving storm such as this one can cross multiple states, leaving a long trail of damage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Tornadoes typically occur across the South from the middle of March until late April, when the risk shifts to the Plains.</p><p>The threat of severe weather is expected to continue into the weekend, as the front pushes eastward.
