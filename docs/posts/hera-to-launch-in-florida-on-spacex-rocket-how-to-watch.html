In case of weather-related delays, the launch window will remain open until Oct. 27.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-1d6dc1b4">Where is Hera going?</h2><p>Hera is headed to an asteroid named Dimorphos, a 495-foot-wide object orbiting an even bigger rock named Didymos. About two years ago, NASA demonstrated for the first time <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/11/science/nasa-dart-asteroid-spacecraft.html" title="">that it was possible to alter the path of an asteroid</a> with the Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART. The mission’s primary spacecraft slammed into Dimorphos at more than 14,000 miles per hour, sending a dusty cloud of debris and boulders thousands of miles into space.</p><p>Hera is going back to the scene to determine what the properties of Dimorphos are, how efficient the DART mission was and how to make deflecting killer asteroids a regular tool in humanity’s planetary defense arsenal.</p><p>Hera is expected to reach Didymos and Dimorphos by October 2026, at which point the spacecraft will be 121 million miles from Earth.</p><h2 id="link-410865e2">What will Hera do when it reaches its destination?</h2><p>A primary goal of the mission is to learn what exactly DART did to Dimorphos. Did it leave a small crater, or was the asteroid completely reshaped, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/26/science/nasa-crash-asteroid-dart-study.html" title="">as one study suggests</a>?</p><p>While circling the two asteroids, Hera will spend up to six months gathering data about Dimorphos with optical cameras, a spectrometer to probe the composition of the asteroid and a thermal imager to measure its surface temperature.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Hera’s high-gain antenna will transmit this data back to Earth; small shifts in the frequency of these signals, caused by Dimorphos’s gravity, will aid scientists in determining the asteroid’s shape and mass.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Italian satellites captured a plume of debris emitted from the collision with the DART spacecraft in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">ASI/NASA</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The mission will also deploy two mini satellites, or CubeSats. One, Juventas, will use radar sounding to probe the interior of Dimorphos. A second, Milani, will image the asteroids and survey the dust surrounding the pair.</p><p>The measurements Hera takes will also lend insight into how binary asteroid systems form and what their environment is like.</p><h2 id="link-6b649c65">How else is humanity planning to avoid destruction from space?</h2><p>Sky trackers around the world have spotted nearly all near-Earth objects wider than about than about 0.6 miles in diameter, which are big enough to cause a global extinction event like the one that killed the dinosaurs. But only about a third of smaller bodies near Earth like Dimorphos — which can cause considerable damage to the planet on their own — have been discovered so far.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The <a href="https://rubinobservatory.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vera C. Rubin Observatory</a> in Chile, set to turn on next year, will help scientists complete that task, as will the <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/near-earth-object-surveyor/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Near-Earth Object Surveyor</a>, a NASA space telescope planned to launch in 2027.</p><p>Planetary defenders are also scrambling to build other spacecraft for more asteroid encounters. Ramses, a mission led by the European Space Agency, could visit Apophis, an asteroid that will come less than 20,000 miles from Earth’s surface in 2029. China’s space program is also planning <a href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/china-targets-its-first-planetary-defense-test-mission" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a DART-like mission</a> that could launch this decade.</p><p>A decade from now, scientists hope that the asteroid target practice, a comprehensive inventory of nearby space rocks and the ability for quick and early reconnaissance will converge into a well-rounded fortress for our cosmic home.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Katrina Miller is a science reporter for The Times based in Chicago.
