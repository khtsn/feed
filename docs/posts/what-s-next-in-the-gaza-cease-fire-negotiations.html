    <h1>What’s Next in the Gaza Cease-Fire Negotiations?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>By Adam Rasgon, Nikolay Nikolov, Laura Salaberry and Christina Shaman</p><!-- --> <p><span>•</span>January 27, 2025</p></div><h2>Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians trekked for hours toward their homes in northern Gaza on Monday, nearly 16 months after Israel launched an offensive there in response to Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks. The returnees confronted wastelands of rubble after the Israeli military destroyed entire neighborhoods and Hamas booby-trapped buildings. Adam Rasgon, a New York Times correspondent, explains why the road to permanent peace remains complicated and elusive despite significant progress in the temporary cease-fire.</h2></div></div>
