They waded through mud hoping to help clean up neighborhoods washed away by floodwaters that have killed at least 214 people.</p><p>Thousands of Spanish citizens made their way to flood-ravaged Valencia over the weekend after the country’s worst natural disaster in recent history left the nation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/world/europe/spain-flash-floods-photos.html" title="">shocked by images of overturned cars and brick homes torn apart by furious water</a>.</p><p>The devastation has become a political flashpoint and brought home fears over the effects of climate change. On Sunday morning, as King Felipe VI walked through a crowd in Paiporta, a town in Valencia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/world/europe/spain-flood-valencia-paiporta.html" title="">where more than 60 people died</a>, angry protesters shouted and threw mud.</p><p>“Killers!” the crowd shouted, according to video footage shared on Spanish news.</p><p>King Felipe was with Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, as well as Carlos Mazón, the regional president of Valencia, on whom many residents lay blame for the sending out of official alerts only after the flooding had reached dangerous levels.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Many people in Paiporta, an epicenter of the destruction, are still waiting for basic supplies from emergency services — and for news of their missing loved ones.</p><p>On Sunday, the grief, fear and anger erupted into frustration that resources were being used for an official walk-through, while emergency workers were still racing to try to find survivors.</p><p>“You abandoned us!” some protesters shouted at the officials, as the men who flanked the king opened black umbrellas to protect him from the mud. “Get out of here!”</p><p>But despite the anger at Spanish officials, for many, the most immediate and important response was to lend a hand.</p><p>While the military, the police and civil guard officers searched for survivors and cleared debris, civilians joined in the effort wherever they could, determined to help Valencia and surrounding regions rebuild and to help its citizens recover.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>On Saturday, a parade of tractors rolled into urban Valencia, a province on Spain’s eastern shoreline, driven by farmers from around the region who had come to help clear debris. “The countryside is once again showing its solidarity,” Valencia’s agricultural association <a href="https://x.com/ava_asaja/status/1852644768389505289" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Volunteers line up to learn how best to provide help to those affected by the floods, at the City of Arts and Sciences complex in Valencia on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nacho Doce/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>With major roads in the Valencia province closed to vehicles, many decided to walk, carrying brooms, rakes and buckets, according to footage aired by Spanish broadcasters. A sea of people crossed the bridge to Paiporta, where mud still clogged the streets after a river burst its banks.</p><p>In urban Valencia, the city’s celebrated soccer club offered Mestalla Stadium as an emergency center where citizens could drop off bags of food, clothes and bottles of water. City officials and volunteers also set up a food bank, serving food along the stadium’s main entrance.</p><p>“The image of Mestalla filled with people coming together, arriving to donate products, and applauding each time a truck leaves full of food and basic necessities, will be unforgettable,” Javier Solís, the club’s corporate director, said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Alongside star players like José Gayà and Jaume Doménech, fans and volunteers sorted and packed food destined for devastated neighborhoods. Candela Reig Moril, an industrial engineering student who lives in central Valencia, helped coordinate university students who wanted to help, and ended up working with hundreds of people who wanted to do something for their city.</p><p>“Many of them come crying because of this huge, unexpected catastrophe,” Ms. Reig Moril, 21, said. “The little children have even come to deliver their toys. It’s very touching to see everybody so willing to show solidarity.”</p><p>Volunteers have used social media or <a href="https://ayudadana.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">message boards</a> set up in response to the disaster to find out how they can help. They have offered beds for displaced families or shelter for pets and have volunteered their professional skills, from logistics management to cooking.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Two women clean inside a kitchen as volunteers help residents with recovery efforts after the flood, in Massanassa, just outside of Valencia, on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alberto Saiz/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Claudia Orts García, a nursing assistant, used a message board to collect food, medication and feminine hygiene products. On Sunday, she and her partner plan to drive from Dénia, a port town south of Valencia city, to the worst affected areas, where they will deliver the donated supplies. Some friends who also wanted to help have asked to ride along. Ms. Orts García said she will also offer medical assistance where possible.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“We will lend a hand in everything that is necessary,” she said.</p><p>Amid the rush to help those in need, there was also a wave of criticism directed at the Spanish government. Parts of Valencia were doused in a year’s worth of rain in just eight hours, and some said government warnings <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/world/europe/spain-floods-blame.html" title="">came too late</a>. Other victims said rescue workers and the police <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/world/europe/spain-rain-floods.html" title="">took too long</a> to respond to the disaster. Dozens were still missing by Saturday. </p><p>For Toni Zamorano, who was trapped on the roof of his car for hours as rain fell, the volunteers have become a lifeline. In the town of Sedaví, houses and businesses were completely flooded. Mr. Zamorano said he has lost everything.</p><p>Were it not for the volunteers who work from sunrise to sunset, he would not have clothes, food and water, he said. Not only have the volunteers provided the basic necessities, they have also restored his faith in humanity, he said.</p><p>“I feel that humanity is still capable of forgetting its differences. Here, race or economic level don’t matter,” he said. “This solidarity makes you feel great, then you close your eyes when you sleep, you remember everything you have seen and you understand the magnitude of this tragedy.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lynsey Chutel is a Times reporter based in London who covers breaking news in Africa, the Middle East and Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lynsey-chutel">More about Lynsey Chutel</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
