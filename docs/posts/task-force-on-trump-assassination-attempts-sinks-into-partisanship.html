Trump devolved into division on Thursday, after Republicans invited two members of Congress who have promoted conspiracy theories about the shooting to testify as witnesses during a hearing.</p><p>Democrats on the panel refused to attend its afternoon session during the testimony of the members, Representatives Eli Crane of Arizona and Cory Mills of Florida, both Republicans and former military snipers.</p><p>The two men have been conducting their own unauthorized investigation after they were not picked for seats on the official task force investigating the July 13 shooting at a Trump rally in Butler, Pa. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/us/politics/trump-assassination-republicans-conspiracy-theories.html" title="">They have promoted conspiracy theories</a> that the shooting was an inside job or that it was carried out by more than one person instead of a lone gunman, Thomas Crooks, 20.</p><p>On Thursday, they encouraged the task force to explore the theory that there was a second gunman working with Mr. Crooks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I challenge you to continue to go forward and to not be feared away from the idea of being labeled a conspiracist by looking into every possible outcome,” Mr. Mills told the Republicans who remained in the room.</p><p>Representative Laurel Lee, Republican of Florida and a task force member, assured the men that the panel would investigate “all of the relevant theories.”</p><p>Outside the hearing room, Representative Jason Crow of Colorado, the top Democrat on the task force, said Republicans surprised Democrats by inviting Mr. Crane and Mr. Mills to testify.</p><p>“We did not receive notice until late yesterday,” Mr. Crow said, adding that Democrats did not feel comfortable without having more time to discuss what the men planned to say.</p><p>Representative Madeleine Dean, Democrat of Pennsylvania, said she was aware of the theories Mr. Mills and Mr. Crane have been promoting. Even so, she said she believed Representative Mike Kelly, Republican of Pennsylvania and the committee’s chairman, would find a way to bring the spirit of bipartisanship back to the panel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I don’t want to be any part of spreading conspiracies,” Ms. Dean said. “I’m always somebody who wants to collect the facts first, not jump in with my own conclusion and try to make the ending meet my conclusion. So that’s why I think it’ll be best if they can say what they want, and I hope we do return to the bipartisan spirit and consensus spirit that brought us to this.”</p><p>The rift came during the first public hearing of the task force, which was approved by a unanimous vote of Congress and had prided itself on operating in a bipartisan manner until Thursday.</p><p>But Speaker Mike Johnson has come under withering criticism from the right wing of his party for declining to name Mr. Crane or Mr. Mills to the panel. In their own investigation, Mr. Mills suggested that “criminal gross negligence” and “criminal intent” might be at play.</p><p>Outside the hearing room, Mr. Kelly said he invited the men to testify based on their expertise as snipers. He said they were there to provide testimony about the law enforcement failures to secure the perimeter at the event in Butler.</p><p>“If you want to participate, you can participate,” Mr. Kelly said of the Democrats walking out. “If you decide not to, you can make that decision too.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The hearing began in a bipartisan manner with Democrats and Republicans alike condemning the failures of the Secret Service while calling for more funding to reform the agency.</p><p>“The Secret Service must be expected to accomplish its zero-fail protection mission without any errors,” Mr. Crow said. “But Congress must also ensure that the Secret Service has the resources it needs to accomplish that mission. It has become apparent since July 13 that the Secret Service is stretched too thin.”</p><p>The panel also presented a newly released video that showed a pivotal moment when an officer confronted the would-be assassin on the roof, before dropping down in apparent fear of being shot himself.</p><p>The testimony in the morning came primarily from Pennsylvania officials, including the medical examiner who performed an autopsy on Mr. Crooks.</p><p>The examiner, Dr. Ariel Goldschmidt of Allegheny County, Pa., told the lawmakers Mr. Crooks died from a single gunshot wound to the head that entered through his lip. He said a toxicology report showed slightly elevated levels of lead in Mr. Crooks’s system, but nothing else amiss.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Thursday was the first time local law enforcement had the chance to publicly explain what its roles were on July 13 and how the planning with the Secret Service in the days leading up to the rally unfolded.</p><p>Local officers had been rankled by the comments from Secret Service leaders in the weeks after the rally that appeared to blame them for security lapses, even as those leaders acknowledged the agency was ultimately at fault.</p><p>At the beginning of Thursday’s hearing, Mr. Kelly praised the local law enforcement members who helped with security on July 13.</p><p>“Local law enforcement has gone through way too much,” Mr. Kelly said. “The work you did that day was exceptional.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eileen Sullivan covers breaking news, the Justice Department, the trials against Donald J.
