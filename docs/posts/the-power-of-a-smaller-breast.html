Miley Cyrus. Keira Knightley. Bella Hadid. I want my breasts to look like this, they say. Theyâve already spent hours on YouTube watching plastic surgeonsâ infomercials, on Instagram poring over before-and-afters, and on TikTok, where an army of ordinary women post about their breast reductions. âAsk me,â they say. Whether their nipple sensation has changed. What their boyfriends said. Whether they cared.</p><p>Sometimes a woman walks into her initial consultation with the bralette she hopes to wear. Or sheâll say, âI canât wait for my braless summer.â Or that she looks forward to shopping for a $15 bikini top at Target, something cute and bright or floral, signaling a life so carefree its wearer might never need fat straps or eye hooks again. Breast reduction patients use words like âfitâ and âstrong.â They talk about âyoga boobs.â</p><p>Friends tell friends about their breast reductions. A surgeon named Donald Mowlds, in Newport Beach, Calif., sees a photo on his feed of a group of women at lunch and realizes heâs operated on all of them. Kelly Killeen, a surgeon in Beverly Hills, says one of her patients flashed her breasts to a friend at the makeup counter at Neiman Marcus and the friend walked across the street to make an appointment. Jamie Hanzo, who is 26 and lives in New Orleans, uses the same plastic surgeon as her mother.</p><p>Tiffany Dena Loftin, who is 35 and a labor organizer in Atlanta, was emboldened to undergo breast reduction after scrutinizing the naked breasts of her friend Jamira Burley, 36, over FaceTime: her bandages, her incisions, her bruised nipples. Loftin doesnât like hospitals. Needles terrify her. But, Burley said, âTiffany, the relief and the joy that Iâm feeling is also available to you on the other side of your fear.â</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>After liposuction, breast augmentation is the most popular cosmetic surgery procedure in the country, with about 300,000 women choosing implants each year. But the growth area in cosmetic breast surgery is in making them smaller. In 2023, more than 76,000 American women had elective breast-reduction surgery, a 64 percent increase since 2019, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. (That number doesnât include gender-affirming top surgeries or breast reconstructions after illness.)

Jerry Chidester, a plastic surgeon in Salt Lake City, said his patients used to ask for C cups. Now, they want Bs. He often does five breast reductions a week, mostly on young, postpartum mothers.</p><p>American women are perpetually at odds with their bodies, which reliably fall short of the perfection embodied by models and influencers. Seventy percent of women worldwide <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1740144519303900" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dislike the size of their breasts</a>. This may be because a womanâs breasts are subject to constant evaluation and critique. Always on view, breasts allude to a womanâs naked body. They evoke in others thoughts and feelings about her femininity, her sexual availability, her age, her weight, her attractiveness, her maternal role. Breasts can be objects of fascination, desire and fetishization. Also revulsion and derision. Large breasts draw more attention â positive and negative â than smaller ones. A 2013 market survey by a lingerie maker put the average American cup size at DD, a factoid that circulates widely online. The majority of breast-reduction patients are bigger than that. The weight of large breasts can cause back, neck and shoulder pain. They can impede mobility and fitness.</p><p>So to decide to reduce them, to make them lighter, smaller, easier to carry and cover â more discreet â can be seen as an act of self-love and empowerment, a womanâs prioritization, finally, of her own comfort and independence over what others have traditionally found sexy. Or it can be interpreted as self-loathing, an agreement with a sexist culture that can also regard larger breasts that arenât youthfully round and upright as repulsive: droopy, flabby, jiggly, hard to contain.</p><p>Or the choice to undergo breast reduction can be, in some paradoxical way, pragmatic. Perceiving, rightly, that she canât change the culture she lives in, a woman might find that the easier path to loving her body is to alter herself.</p><p>Doctors say their patients seem willing to live with the scars, which encircle the nipple, course down the lower part of the breast like a longitude line, and sometimes trace the ribs under the breast where an underwire might sit. During their FaceTime sessions, Loftin talked to Burley, who lives in Oakland, about what she was sacrificing â being conventionally pleasing to men â and about whether her boyfriend would recoil from the scars or privately resent the dramatic change in her shape. But Burley just seemed so much brighter, Loftin said, that she was inspired to call a surgeon, too. Loftin is grateful to her partner, who paid for her consultation and accompanied her to every appointment and through her recovery. If he had conflicting feelings, he kept them to himself.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>And many women are undeterred by the possibility that the surgery might impede breastfeeding.

He compared the effort to Leonardo da Vinciâs delineations of the human face into thirds and fifths. How could surgeons hope to reshape and upgrade womenâs breasts, Mallucci argued, without knowing what they were aiming for?</p><p>It was the era of aspirational voluptuousness: The Kardashians were peaking and the celebrity gossip site TMZ reported that âKate Uptonâs Boobs Defy Gravity!â In 2007, plastic surgeons performed nearly 350,000 breast augmentations, a record, and the procedure remained the most popular in the nation until 2021.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mallucci based his analysis on an examination of 100 photos of topless women that ran on the website of the tabloid The Sun, reasoning that their breasts reflected a consensus on attractiveness. Many Sun readers considered the photos to be soft porn (and The Sun later ceased publishing them), but Mallucci pushed back when I called him and pointed that out.</p><p>âThose girls were selected by an editorial board,â he said. âYou can critique, but all they represent are naturally attractive breasts.â</p><p>In his article, Mallucci described, in the language of poles, curves and angles, what these breasts had in common. They were rounded below the nipple, not too round above it and the nipple sat high on the breast. On âunattractiveâ breasts, he wrote, the nipples pointed downward.</p><p>Dr. Killeen remembers learning about Mallucciâs standard as a medical resident, and fuming. Most womenâs breasts just donât look like that. âI hate the word âideal,ââ she said in an interview. If an ideal breast is attainable only through surgery, she added, âShould it be ideal?â</p><p>âListening to men tell us what our body parts should look like was disgusting,â she said. âI was like, What is happening here?

On the Reddit board r/Reduction, women post about surgeons who make comments about their weight, express their own preferences for âcute and roundâ breasts and defer to husbands or partners in the examination room. Suma Kashi, who is 41 and lives in Los Angeles, recalled talking to a prospective surgeon who said, âI donât think your husband is going to like this.â</p><p>âWhat does my husband have to do with this?â Kashi said in an interview. âCome on, man.

After breast reconstruction she had Ds, which felt huge to her â âbulky and cartoony,â she wrote in âTits Up,â her recent social history of the breast. Eventually, she had another surgery to reduce the size of her implants. But she wouldnât call the decision a liberation, necessarily.</p><p>âI went from an uncomfortable implant that I really hated to a smaller one thatâs placed slightly differently,â she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Having immersed herself in womenâs ideas and feelings about their breasts during the four years she researched her book, Thornton supports whatever decision a woman wants to make about her top half. But she worries about casting breast reduction solely as feminist emancipation. For one thing, she said, âplastic surgery is a consumer option. Thereâs usually a lot of money involved.â For another, womenâs body dissatisfaction, circulating virally online, is âperniciousâ and âcontagious,â Thornton said, contributing to the idea that thereâs always something about women&#39;s bodies that needs to be fixed.</p><p>âNothing you do will ever be good enough, and if youâre doing anything for purely aesthetic reasons, youâre never going to be completely content with how you look,â said Rae Wolk, the college student.</p><p>Small breasts may not draw as much attention on the subway or the street as bigger breasts do, but they are also a fashion. Whereas big breasts signal motherhood and sexual availability, smaller breasts can convey youth, girlishness, puberty, thinness, androgyny. Bralessness, an uncovered nipple, can titillate as much as cleavage can. Wolk feels that her smaller breasts make her more feminine, more like a âcoquette,â she said.</p><p>They can also indicate class. In March, a meme circulated on X and has been viewed 32 million times. âMEN,â it said. âWhich do you prefer? The aristocratic elegance of the small breasted woman OR the Nietzschean pro-sex, pro-beauty large breasted woman?â Thornton agrees that smaller breasts signal the self-assurance of affluence whereas breast augmentation can signify social ambition â a desire to attain wealth and status via the attention of men.</p><p>âUpper middle class women have different kinds of value they can draw from,â she added. âThey may have a college degree.
