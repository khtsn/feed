As more Palestinians fled their homes in the area, international demands intensified on Friday for Israel to allow an urgent influx of aid to keep all of the territory from tipping into famine.</p><p>Tensions over getting food, fuel and other humanitarian supplies to desperate Palestinians in the enclave were heightened by the specter of a new Israeli military operation in the 20-month war against Hamas. Avichay Adraee, an Arabic-language spokesman for the military, <a href="https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1928188752137965694" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued the evacuation order late Thursday,</a> warning that these areas could become “dangerous combat zones” at any time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Maps show that only a few neighborhoods in northern Gaza City were still unaffected by evacuation orders over the past 10 days. The latest order urged residents of parts of northern Gaza to move west toward the Mediterranean coast.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Many in the north have already been displaced at least once during the war, and little humanitarian aid has been reaching the area, where hunger is widespread.</p><p>Israel has been fighting to uproot Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that has long ruled Gaza and which led the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and ignited the war. As a cease-fire agreement between the two sides was unraveling in March, Israel blockaded all humanitarian aid from Gaza’s two million people, accusing Hamas of siphoning it off, selling it for profit and using it as a tool to control the population.</p><p>This week, a new aid delivery system backed by Israel and the United States was launched with three distribution centers opening in southern and central Gaza. The agency running the centers, known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, said on Friday that it had delivered 2.1 million meals in its first four days. </p><p>But with insecurity and chaos around distribution sites and food storage areas growing, and aid quantities falling far short of needs, European allies warned Israel on Friday of consequences if it did not move quickly and decisively to alleviate the hunger.</p><p>“If there is not a response to the humanitarian situation in the next few hours today, we will have to harden the collective position,” President Emmanuel Macron of France <a href="https://x.com/BFMTV/status/1928312581241844139?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1928312581241844139%7Ctwgr%5E5449303330096475a4ddc6c7282498611a0c1f92%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.leparisien.fr%2Finternational%2Fgaza-emmanuel-macron-veut-durcir-la-position-contre-israel-sil-ny-a-pas-douverture-humanitaire-30-05-2025-TBYFKX7VBRA2BJHYK6TP3FFMUU.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Friday at a security forum</a> in Singapore. “It’s very clear today that we cannot let this situation last.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Germany’s foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, <a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-856099" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Berlin will weigh whether to continue new weapons shipments to Israel and questioned whether the campaign in Gaza adhered to international law. Britain and Canada also have threatened repercussions.</p><p>Israeli officials defiantly shot back, accusing Mr. Macron of playing into Hamas’ hands. Israel’s <a href="https://x.com/israelmfa/status/1928428248976834958?s=46" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Foreign Ministry</a> said the government was facilitating the entry of humanitarian aid. “The facts do not interest Macron,” it said.</p><p>The United Nations and other aid organizations have declined to cooperate with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, describing it as a militarized distribution operation that violates humanitarian principles.</p><p>On Friday, Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the U.N. humanitarian agency, called Gaza “the hungriest place on Earth,” and accused Israel of “drip feeding food into an area on the verge of catastrophic hunger.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A strike in Jabaliya, north of Gaza City, as Palestinians fled their homes on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Fueling the tensions is uncertainty over a new cease-fire proposal put forward by the Trump administration that would free a few dozen Israeli hostages, alive and dead, still being held in Gaza, and release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>On Friday, a Hamas official, Basem Naim, said his group was still reviewing the latest proposal offered by Steve Witkoff, the Trump administration’s chief envoy to the negotiations.</p><p>American and Israeli officials said Mr. Witkoff’s proposal, which has Israel’s support, would allow the flow of aid into Gaza through U.N.-run operations and an initial 60-day cease-fire as negotiations continued.</p><p>Hamas officials suggested it did not contain strong enough guarantees on ending the war — one of the chief sticking points in the cease-fire negotiations. But they have stopped short of rejecting it outright.</p><p>Israel is insisting on having the option to resume fighting if Hamas does not surrender and disarm. Hamas is demanding firm guarantees that a temporary cease-fire would lead to a permanent cessation of hostilities and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.</p><p>Nick Cumming-Bruce<!-- --> contributed reporting from Geneva.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lara Jakes, based in Rome, reports on diplomatic and military efforts by the West to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.
