When I looked at that — I said, that’s the way it was meant to be.” “As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale.” “That’s true.” “We’re sitting in one right now. Buckingham Palace that you visited as well.” “That’s true.” “And having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign, last several months, it’s not for sale. It won’t be for sale, ever. But the opportunity is in the partnership and what we can build together.” “It’s only time. But I say, never say never. I’ve had many, many things that were not doable, and they ended up being doable and only doable in a very friendly way. But if it’s to everybody’s benefit, Canada loves us and we love Canada. That’s I think the No. 1 thing that’s important. But we’ll see. I mean over time, we’ll see what happens.” “Respectfully, Canadians’ view on this is not going to change on the 51st state. Secondly, we are the largest client of the United States in the totality of all the goods. So we are the largest client of the United States. We have a tremendous auto sector between the two of us, and the changes that made have been helpful. You know, 50 percent of a car that comes from Canada is American. That’s not like anywhere else in the world. And to your question about is there one thing? No, this is a bigger discussion. There are much bigger forces involved. And this will take some time and some discussions. And that’s why we’re here.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/06vid-trump-carney-pkg-cov-hqtk/06vid-trump-carney-pkg-cov-hqtk-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">President Trump and Prime Minister Mark Carney, Canada’s newly elected leader, went back and forth on the prospect of the U.S. making Canada the 51st state.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><p><time datetime="2025-05-06T15:50:20-04:00"><span>May 6, 2025</span><span>Updated <span>3:50 p.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada had one key goal in his high-stakes meeting with President Trump on Tuesday: say, in no uncertain terms, that Canada is not going to become the 51st state, while avoiding a public fight.</p><p>And he succeeded.</p><p>“As you know from real estate, there are some places that are not for sale,” Mr. Carney said solemnly. “It’s not for sale. It won’t be for sale, ever,” he added.</p><p>“Never say never,” Mr. Trump replied. But the moment’s potency had been defused, and Mr. Trump clearly was not interested in having a fight with Mr. Carney, whom he praised for a stunning electoral victory just a few days ago.</p><p>The relationship between the next-door neighbors, allies and top trading partners has been at a historic low since Mr. Trump’s re-election, because of his decision to impose tariffs on Canadian goods and his constant refrain that he wants to make Canada part of the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Less than an hour before Mr. Carney arrived at the White House, Mr. Trump unloaded on Canada in a bellicose post on Truth Social, repeating his frequent criticisms that the country was too dependent on the United States.</p><p>“We don’t need ANYTHING they have, other than their friendship, which hopefully we will always maintain,” Mr. Trump wrote. “They, on the other hand, need EVERYTHING from us!”</p><p>But Mr. Trump struck a much more conciliatory tone once the two leaders sat down together in the Oval Office. Mr. Trump congratulated Mr. Carney on his election, praising the campaign he ran as “one of the greatest comebacks in the history of politics.” (He did not mention that Mr. Carney won on an anti-Trump platform).</p><p>“We have some tough points to go over, and that’ll be fine,” Mr. Trump said.</p><p>As the public portion of the meeting came to a close, Mr. Trump contrasted this meeting with the disastrous one that Mr. Carney took pains to avoid: the Oval Office meeting in February between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.</p><p>“We had another little blow up with somebody else,” Mr. Trump said. “That was a much different. This is, this is a very friendly conversation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Carney spoke just three times over the course of a half-hour meeting in front of the cameras. Mr. Trump dominated the airtime, mostly with comments that veered off topic.</p><p>After their public remarks in the Oval Office, the two leaders went on to a private working lunch, flanked by some of their top advisers and ministers. That is most likely be where the substantive conversation about the future of the relationship would begin, although there were no expectations that a breakthrough would be reached in Tuesday’s meeting.</p><p>Canada and the United States share, together with Mexico, a free-trade agreement that now lies in tatters; Mr. Trump has said that trade with Canada overly favors Canada and hurts the United States.</p><p>Mr. Carney said that the discussions between the two of them would take time, and would extend well beyond trade issues to encompass other areas such as security and defense.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matina Stevis-Gridneff is the Canada bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the country.</p></div><div><p>Tyler Pager is a White House correspondent for The Times, covering President Trump and his administration.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>States Sue Administration Over H.H.S.</strong><strong>:</strong> The lawsuit, led by New York, argues that the slashing of grants and staff at the Department of Health and Human Services <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/states-lawsuit-trump-administration-hhs-cutbacks.html">amounts to the “illegal dismantling” of the agency.</a></p></li><li><p>‘<strong>Canada Is Not for Sale’</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>President Trump and Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada, in the first meeting between the two leaders, sparred over the president’s talk of making Canada the 51st state.
