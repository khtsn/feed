Around him, he said, windows were shattered and cars were damaged. “The ground is full of sparrows,” he said, “dead on the sidewalks.”</p><p>Mr. Yerai is one of millions of people in southern and eastern Spain — including cities such as Valencia, Murcia and Malaga — hit by the immense deluge, which began in earnest on Monday night. In some areas, more than a month’s worth of rain fell in a day. In the region of Andalusia, it was four times the amount of rain that usually falls in all of October.</p><p>Early Wednesday morning, Reuters reported, the leader of the Valencia region said that bodies had been found after flash flooding, though he didn’t say how many.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p> “Out of respect for the families, we are not going to provide any further data,” the leader, Carlos Mazón said.</p><p>Spain’s meteorological agency said that between 150 and 200 liters per square meter, or roughly 40 to 50 gallons per square yard, <a href="https://x.com/GVA112/status/1851192795706368115?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1851192795706368115%7Ctwgr%5E620405a247e22f4985ff650e9115c71a9868eb07%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.larazon.es%2Fel-tiempo%2Fultima-hora-dana-espana-aemet-eleva-naranja-alerta-fuertes-lluvias-tormentas_2024102967208ae0d058410001c7dc73.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fell in some areas</a> over a two-hour period.

That produces robust rain clouds. Then, the storm system pushes these moisture-rich clouds into Spain.</p><p>“These episodes have become more extreme in recent years, causing severe damage,” said Mar Gómez, a Spanish physicist and meteorologist.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Clearing debris in Valencia, Spain, on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Natxo Frances/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>That’s partly because warmer air can retain more water vapor, Mr. del Campo, of the meteorological agency, said, which means that when it rains, there is more to fall. The Mediterranean is also getting hotter, which is making such rainfalls more violent and more frequent. In August, the sea <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/climate/central-europe-floods-global-warming.html" title="">hit its highest ever recorded</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/climate/central-europe-floods-global-warming.html" title="">temperature</a>.</p><p>“This is created by cold air interacting with a hotter surface, and the hotter surface is becoming hotter,” said Miriam Zaitegui Pérez, the Spanish director of the European Climate Foundation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>In 2019, a river in Valencia <a href="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2019/09/12/album/1568296662_104425.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">burst its banks</a> after a cold drop, and many residents were evacuated. At least six people died in that storm, which was the worst in eastern Spain in 140 years, <a href="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2019/09/16/inenglish/1568618372_639259.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">El País newspaper reported</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A flooded parking area in Valencia, Spain on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ana Escobar/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The phenomenon has also become more geographically spread, Mr. del Campo said. The rains caused by a cold drop no longer just hit the coast, but also cities like Madrid, “where it is not usual to have this type of abundant rainfall.”</p><p>For now, Mr. Yerai, the farmer, is assessing the damage. He has lost some of the investments that he made for his crops — green and red peppers bound primarily for northern European markets — and will have to move quickly to repair the greenhouses before winter. No one in his family was injured.</p><p>“We farmers have a similar philosophy to fishermen: We have to go out to work, keep moving on and do what we can to survive,” he said.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
