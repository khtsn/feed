But photos of the group later shared to social media by Vice President Kamala Harris and the Carter Center left one of them out of frame: President-elect Donald J. Trump.</p><p>Ms. Harris, who lost a bitterly fought campaign to Mr. Trump, and Mr. Carter had both been harshly criticized by the president-elect, who attended the funeral at Washington National Cathedral with his wife, Melania Trump.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEsBtwZzPSp/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">photo</a> shared from the vice president’s official social media accounts on Saturday featured the three Democrats the most prominently.</p><p>It showed President Biden, along with former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, standing with their hands over their hearts. Former President George W. Bush, a Republican, was obscured by Doug Emhoff, Ms. Harris’s husband, who was standing next to her in the front pew.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump was next to Mr. Obama. In the photo, a large pillar appeared to block both Mr. and Mrs. Trump, who were at the end of their row.</p><p>“President Jimmy Carter loved our country,” Ms. Harris wrote in her post. “He lived his faith, served the people, and left the world better than he found it.”</p><p>The Carter Center a nonprofit started by Mr. Carter after leaving the White House, shared a <a href="https://x.com/CarterCenter/status/1877417019722657942/photo/3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">different photo</a> on Thursday of the funeral scene. Shot from a lower vantage point, it shows the attendees seated, with the president and vice president and their spouses clearly visible in the front row. In the second row, Mr. Clinton, Laura Bush and Mr. Obama are visible. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Mr. Bush are partly obscured, and the Trumps cannot be seen at all.</p><p>It was not clear whether the omissions of Mr. Trump were intentional. Other photos taken by the news media during the funeral showed all five presidents in the same frame.</p><p>A representative for Ms. Harris’s office declined to comment on Saturday.</p><p>The Carter Center and Mr. Trump’s White House transition team did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The state funeral service for Mr. Carter, who was the nation’s oldest living former president when he died at age 100, was marked by rare displays of bipartisanship at a moment of deep political divisions. Mr. Obama chatted amiably with Mr. Trump, who had spent years trying to undermine the legitimacy of Mr. Obama’s presidency with baseless claims about his citizenship.</p><p>Other Republicans in attendance included Mr. Bush and Mike Pence, who was Mr. Trump’s vice president during his first term and was the target of rioters during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. During the election, Mr. Pence refused to endorse Mr. Trump because of his actions during the riot. At the funeral, they came together awkwardly for a handshake.</p><p>Some other dignitaries did not shake Mr. Trump’s hand and appeared to avoid him, including Karen Pence, Mr. Pence’s wife, and Mr. Bush.</p><p>Michelle Obama, the former first lady, did not attend the service.</p><p>Eli Cohen<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Neil Vigdor covers politics for The Times, focusing on voting rights issues and election disinformation.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/neil-vigdor">More about Neil Vigdor</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
