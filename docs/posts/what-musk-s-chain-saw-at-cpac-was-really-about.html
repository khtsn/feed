    <h1>What Musk’s Chain Saw at CPAC Was Really About</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The music was booming. The ballroom was packed. And Elon Musk was onstage, waving a chain saw in the air.</p><p>I had already seen other surreal sights at the Conservative Political Action Conference — a man with a cat on his shoulder, freshly pardoned Proud Boys <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/us/cpac-january-6-proud-boys.html" title="">roaming around</a> — but it was clear that this would be one of the indelible images of the annual MAGA confab.</p><p>Musk roared — or was he just making a chain saw noise? This, he said, was the chain saw he was taking to the bureaucracy. “Chain saw,” he repeated for effect. He did not turn it on.</p><p>It was a gift from Javier Milei, the far-right Argentine president who stormed to power in 2023 and who has drawn effusive, at times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/technology/elon-musk-world-leaders.html" title="">almost graphic</a>, praise from Musk.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The episode showed how Musk doesn’t just cozy up to right-wing leaders — he also seems to copy them.</p><p>In 2022, Milei, an economist and former media personality, released a “chain saw plan” that would have cut public spending and sharply reduced the number of ministries in Argentina’s government. Milei showed up to campaign rallies with a functioning chain saw — and his supporters followed suit with replicas — that represented his demonization of a group he called “the political caste.”</p><p>Once Milei took office, Musk showered him with online compliments and talked business with him behind closed doors, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/technology/elon-musk-world-leaders.html" title="">as my colleagues wrote last year</a>. He has done the same with right-wing leaders in India and Brazil, in a convenient marriage of his political beliefs and his desire to make more money for his companies.</p><p>And Musk has made a point of talking up Milei’s approach to government cuts, calling them “awesome” in a January post on X and praising Milei for “deleting entire departments.” He’s now calling for the United States government to do the same.</p><p>Musk’s embrace of the global right delighted the CPAC attendees, who welcomed him as one of their own even though it wasn’t so long ago that he was a Democrat warning the world about climate change. Everybody was on the same page about what really mattered.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I don’t really approve of his, like, family situation, where he’s got so many kids,” said Pam Roehl, 59, referring to Musk’s 12 children with several different women.</p><p>But Ms. Roehl, a retiree who splits her time between Chicago and Nashville, loves the X platform. And she loves what Musk is doing in the government.</p><p>“Getting to the bottom of, like, government waste, I think, is phenomenal,” she said.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-19310397">The latest Musk news</h2><ul><li><p>In the latest clash over the Musk team’s quest for Americans’ personal information, the Internal Revenue Service <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/us/politics/irs-doge-gavin-kliger.html?smid=url-share" title="">barred an ally of the billionaire from seeing individual tax returns</a>, Andrew Duehren writes.</p></li><li><p>The Justice Department is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/us/politics/spacex-elon-musk-discrimination-doj.html" title="">dropping a case</a> against SpaceX, which had been accused of discriminating against refugees and people who had been granted asylum. The department did not give a reason for the move.</p></li><li><p>Musk seems set to keep pouring his fortune into politics: His super PAC <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/us/politics/elon-musk-wisconsin-supreme-court.html" title="">has spent $1 million</a> to support the conservative candidate in an important race for the Wisconsin Supreme Court.</p></li><li><p>Musk’s father, Errol Musk, who recently called his son a bad parent of his many children, wants the world to know that the two men are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/style/elon-musk-father-errol-comments.html" title="">actually on very good terms</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Over in the Opinion section</strong>, Zeynep Tufekci <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/opinion/musk-doge-personal-data.html" title="">argues that Musk is exploiting technological vulnerabilities</a> in the U.S. government.</p></li></ul><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Agency status report</p><h2 id="link-78ebbaf8">A crisis at the F.D.A.</h2><p><em>In recent years, the Food and Drug Administration scooped up experts in robotics and artificial intelligence and put them to work keeping up with advances in medical technology. My colleague </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/christina-jewett" title=""><em>Christina Jewett</em></a><em> reports that layoffs at the agency that might have seemed small — 700 people on a staff of 18,000 — </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/health/fda-trump-layoffs-device-and-food-safety.html" title=""><em>wiped away many of those efforts</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Staff cuts have taken a major toll on the Food and Drug Administration, gutting some teams that oversee the safety of medical devices that can be lifesaving, or deadly.</p><p>One such team reviews devices for people with diabetes. New products dip under the skin to read glucose levels and deliver insulin automatically. About half of the team is gone after the firings, even though the team reviews applications for new devices and field complaints when patients are hospitalized or die.</p><p>A similar level of cuts hit the team that regulates the surgical robots that operate on the heart and reproductive organs. Albert Yee was among those who were fired — but he got a call from the F.D.A. about four hours after my article ran, offering him his job back. He plans to return on Monday morning.</p><p>Some experts who have had a hand in looking at Musk’s Neuralink brain implant were fired. The device is the size of a small stack of half-dollars and is installed by a surgical robot that cuts a hole in the skull and implants it along with tiny threads meant to read brain activity. The F.D.A. is now overseeing the study of the device. It’s been implanted in three people so far, including one we <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/health/elon-musk-brain-implant-arbaugh.html" title="">profiled last May</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Musk onstage at CPAC on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>meanwhile on x</p><h2 id="link-38147fe5">The making of a human meme</h2><p><em>My colleague </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kate-conger" title=""><em>Kate Conger</em></a><em> is keeping an eye on Musk’s X posts, and on how he’s blending his online persona with his new role in Washington.</em></p><p>On his social media site, X, Musk celebrated his CPAC appearance and shared video clips from his interview there. The images and videos lend themselves to Musk’s mythmaking project, as he tries to build an image of himself as a creature of the internet who is now raiding the federal bureaucracy.</p><p>These posts help Musk translate his work across two cultures — his chronically online fan base and his new government policy circles. By memeing his work in Washington, he makes it accessible to his followers and encourages them to keep cheering him on.</p><p>One of the first things Musk said at CPAC was “I am become meme,” which is a meme itself. The phrase refers to a quotation from J. Robert Oppenheimer — “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds” — and it has been endlessly recycled and remixed online.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But Musk was also apparently referring to an image of himself that was generated last year by artificial intelligence. It shows him shrouded in a leather jacket and square-framed black glasses, sitting behind a gold-plated sign that reads “DOGE.” Musk wore a remarkably similar outfit at CPAC, down to the thick gold chain around his neck, and when his followers noticed this, he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1892781703317389345" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">re-shared the A.I. image</a> and commented, “I am become meme.”</p><p>At CPAC, Musk talked about making memes a reality. “There’s living the dream and then there’s living the meme, which is pretty much what’s happening, you know?” he said. “I mean, DOGE started out as a meme — think about it.”</p><p>His so-called Department of Government Efficiency borrows its name from the Dogecoin cryptocurrency. Some of Musk’s X followers suggested the name DOGE to him last year, and Musk ran with it, turning the online joke into a transformative force in Washington.</p><p>All of this gives Musk’s followers the intoxicating feeling of being in on the joke, and a sense that they’re adjacent to power. For all they know, one of their replies to Musk on X could become the next idea for his Washington takeover.</p><p>— <!-- -->Kate Conger</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><hr/><p>BY THE NUMBERS</p><h2 id="link-2ef1912e">The head count</h2><p>My colleagues are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/11/us/politics/trump-musk-doge-federal-workers.html" title="">tracking the numbers</a> behind Trump and Musk’s attempts to shrink the government payroll.
