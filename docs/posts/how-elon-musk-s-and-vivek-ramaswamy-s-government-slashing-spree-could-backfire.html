Ramaswamy said on a September <a href="https://x.com/lexfridman/status/1839011666534490525?t=1356" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">podcast</a> that if the federal government fired 75 percent of its employees, “not a thing” would change “for the ordinary American, other than the size of their government being a lot smaller and more restrained, spending a lot less money to operate it.”</p><p>Um, guys? Take a look at this chart of people directly or indirectly working for the federal government as a share of the U.S. population age 16 and older. It’s lower now than when President Reagan was in office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Yes, there is a lot of waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government. But overstaffing should not be the first thing on the agenda of the Department of Government Efficiency, which Donald Trump has said he will create and appoint Musk and Ramaswamy to lead.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>If anything, the problem may more often be understaffing in key positions: The federal government doesn’t have the people it needs to adequately monitor and vet its enormous streams of payments to defense contractors, hospitals and individuals. For example, administrative expenses <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/admin.html#:~:text=The%20table%20below%20shows%20Social,cost%20from%20the%20trust%20funds." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">account</a> for only half a percent of the budget of the Social Security Administration. Trying to squeeze down that half percent by cutting personnel could lead to misspending of the other 99.5 percent of the budget.</p><p>I interviewed three Republicans who have spent parts of their careers trying to curb waste, fraud and abuse in government. All three said they applaud the mission of the Department of Government Efficiency, but all three also said that the job requires on-the-ground knowledge and finesse.</p><p>“I doubt if a C.E.O. or anyone outside of government has the attention span or the interest to truly go into the weeds,” Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, told me. Riedl worked for six years as chief economist to former Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio.</p><p>Dan Lips, the head of policy at the Foundation for American Innovation, who was a Senate Republican staffer from 2011 to 2019, told me that “having very animated, high-profile leaders looking at these issues with a fresh perspective will be helpful.” But Lips recommended that rather than start from scratch, Musk and Ramaswamy should draw on the detailed work on improving efficiency that has already been done, including by the Government Accountability Office, the inspectors general in each department and various congressional committees.</p><p>The Government Accountability Office in particular already does a lot of what Musk and Ramaswamy have in mind, except with the advantage of deep institutional knowledge. By its <a href="https://www.gao.gov/about" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">own accounting</a>, it has produced benefits of $123 for every dollar put into it over the past six years on average.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Musk and Ramaswamy have lost some credibility with potential allies by lobbying for ideas that are clearly impossible, such as ditching three-quarters of the federal work force or, as Musk has floated, cutting $2 trillion out of the federal government’s nearly $7 trillion budget. (That would be more than everything the government spends on stuff other than defense, interest and transfer payments such as Medicare and Social Security.)</p><p>The $2 trillion figure “makes no sense whatsoever,” William Hoagland, a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told me. As a Republican staffer in the Senate for 25 years, Hoagland participated in major federal budget negotiations, including the 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit reduction act and the 1997 balanced budget agreement.</p><p>I realize that to Americans fed up with paying taxes they think are too high, it’s frustrating to hear from Beltway insiders — Republicans no less — that the job of cutting fat and fraud is harder than it seems. Ramaswamy, the biotech entrepreneur who sought the Republican nomination for president last year, said on the September podcast that cutting judiciously never works because it’s like chopping one of the heads off an eight-headed hydra: “It grows right back.”</p><p>But the people I interviewed, Riedl in particular, made a strong case that there is no swift, sweeping solution. A lot of what the government does is hand out money, but its online payment systems are antiquated, making them ripe for mistakes and abuse, Riedl said. In fiscal year 2022, “18 agencies reported an estimated $247 billion in improper payments across 82 programs,” according to a Government Accountability Office <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-106285.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>.</p><p>To fix such problems, Riedl said, “you need G.A.O. and other government experts and others who have done auditing to do most of the legwork.” There is no single easily repeatable fix: “Every program, every program failure and example of mismanagement has its own story.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Typically, Riedl said, outsiders who write reports about waste, fraud and abuse “are much better at diagnosing than coming up with new systems to solve it.”</p><p>Even at X, the 80 percent staff reduction was no miracle solution. Dropping almost all content moderation alienated advertisers, for one thing. The mutual fund company Fidelity <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/02/business/elon-musk-twitter-x-fidelity/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimates</a> that X is worth barely more than a fifth of the $44 billion that Musk spent on it.</p><p>Indiscriminate cuts could be even more counterproductive in the case of Musk’s and Ramaswamy’s new initiative if it leaves too few people to keep track of the checks that the government writes. Paul Light, a New York University professor emeritus who did the calculations in the chart above, told me Monday, “There are a lot of paths to reducing capacity — and undermining performance.”</p><hr/><h2 id="link-45a06fbe">Elsewhere: Well, So Much for Facts</h2><p>Information that highlights benefits from international trade can backfire by making people support it less, particularly if they’re Republicans, a study has found. Showing people research that demonstrates gains such as lower consumer prices “induces protectionist policy choices,” Laura Alfaro of Harvard Business School, Maggie Chen of George Washington University and Davin Chor of Dartmouth College wrote in a <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31240" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">working paper</a> released last month.
