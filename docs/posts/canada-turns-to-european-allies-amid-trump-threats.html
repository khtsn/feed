Canada has retaliated with its own tariffs on American goods.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But Mr. Trump has also repeatedly declared that Canada should become a U.S. state, and has suggested that he wants to scrap the treaty that demarcates the border between the two nations.</p><p>The menacing attitude from Mr. Trump has enraged Canadians, and given Mr. Carney a boost that’s landed him at the helm of his party and his country.</p><p>His Europe trip did not yield any specific new commitments but it was an opportunity for Mr. Carney to advance two goals: to reach out to key allies in Europe, showing that Canada has more friends than just the United States, and to display his gravitas on the world stage as he prepares for an election.</p><p>Mr. Carney was elected leader of Canada’s Liberal Party on March 8 and was sworn in as prime minister on Friday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>He is expected to call an election as early as this week. He is not an elected member of Canada’s Parliament, and his party operates a minority government, putting him under pressure to seek a mandate to govern. </p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Carney also met earlier on Monday with President Emmanuel Macron of France in Paris.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Carlos Osorio/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h3 id="link-1365e179"><span>At Home In The World</span></h3><p>A career banker who served in two high-profile positions — as governor of the Bank of Canada and then of Bank of England — Mr. Carney is running Canada amid existential threats from its closest ally, neighbor and trading partner, while also launching a political campaign, something he has never done.</p><p>Against this backdrop, his European trip played to his strengths at a time when many Canadians are yearning to see their allies step up for them.</p><p>Mr. Macron greeted Mr. Carney as an old friend, boosting his image as someone who is at home on the world stage, familiar with its leaders and its problems, at a time of geopolitical and economic turmoil because of Mr. Trump’s revision of America’s alliances and policies.</p><p>“Given that we’ve known each other for many years, I know that we are receiving a man who loves his country, who is committed to his country,” Mr. Macron said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>France and Britain are foundational to Canada, having led its settlement by Europeans centuries ago.</p><p>Mr. Carney’s personal ties to Britain run deep. His wife is British and he studied at the University of Oxford. In 2013 he became the first foreigner ever to be chosen governor of the Bank of England and he gained British citizenship in 2018. He has moved to renounce his British citizenship, and the Irish citizenship he holds through ancestry, because of his position as prime minister, a spokeswoman said.</p><p>His political opponents have sought to paint him as a globalist with little real attachment to serving his home country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Ambassador Bridge, where $400 billion in trade crosses between Canada and the United States each year, connects Detroit with Windsor, Ontario.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ian Willms for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h3 id="link-42b9c06a"><span>Reality Check</span></h3><p>Despite the symbolism of Mr. Carney’s welcome on his quick European tour, the reality is that Canada’s relationship to the United States is inescapable and irreplaceable.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The United States is Canada’s top trading partner; about 80 percent of Canadian exports go to the United States and the trade volume between the two nations is nearly one trillion dollars.</p><p>By contrast, last year, trade between Canada and Britain was worth about 61 billion Canadian dollars ($43 billion). Canada’s trade with the European Union as a bloc was more significant, growing to over $100 billion last year, making the E.U. Canada’s second-largest trading partner.</p><p>On Monday evening Mr. Carney said that the tariff and counter-tariff pattern was not sustainable, and he expressed an interest in having serious negotiations with the United States.</p><p>“What we’re looking for with respect to the United States, is to have a more comprehensive discussion of a negotiation of our overall commercial and security relationship,” Mr. Carney told the news media in London, adding that there were limits to the retaliatory tariffs Canada could impose on the United States.</p><p>Pressed to respond to Mr. Trump’s rhetoric about annexing Canada, Mr. Carney said it was “unthinkable” that the United States would make such a move on Canada. “Let me state the obvious, which is that both of us are members of NATO,” he added.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
