    <h1>Israeli Strikes in Beirut’s Center Shatter a Tenuous Sense of Security</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Zahwi had rented an apartment on the third floor of this building with his wife and three children weeks earlier, after Israeli airstrikes began raining down near his home in the southern suburbs of Beirut. The cramped collection of neighborhoods there, known as the Dahiya, is effectively governed by Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group and political party in Lebanon that is at war with Israel.</p><p>His three children were shaken but not injured when the strikes tore through the building in Mar Elias on Sunday evening, Mr. Zahwi said. But now, with the Dahiya still too dangerous to return to, he was at a loss for where his family might go, and wondered if anywhere was really safe.</p><p>“Before I was in Dahiya. Now I’m here. The question is, where can I go next?” he said.</p><p>The strikes on Sunday were the first in Beirut proper in weeks, and came amid a new escalation in the war over the past week. In that time, Israel has unleashed its most intense bombardment yet of the Dahiya, hitting the area both day and night. In the south, Israeli forces appear to be making incursions deeper into Lebanon, moving beyond border villages that have been left in ruins.</p><p>Hezbollah said on Monday that it had repeatedly attacked Israeli forces near Khiam, a large town in southern Lebanon that Israeli troops have been pushing toward in recent days. Lebanon’s state-run news agency reported heavy airstrikes on the town and the wider province.</p><p>Israel’s intensified push on the battlefield appears aimed at pressuring Hezbollah to accept the terms of a cease-fire for Lebanon devised by Israeli and American officials, analysts say. But within Lebanon, it has stoked concerns that Israel may have been emboldened by the incoming administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump, whose nominees for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/middleeast/huckabee-israel-witkoff-middle-east-us.html" title="">top diplomatic envoys to the Middle East</a> have signaled fervent support for Israel.</p><p>Euan Ward<!-- --> contributed reporting from Beirut.</p></div></div>
