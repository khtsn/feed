It’ll feature a eulogy by President Biden and culminate more than a week of ceremonies and remembrances.</p><p>Carter, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/us/politics/jimmy-carter-dead.html" title="">died at his home in Plains, Ga., at 100 on Sunday</a>, will lie in repose this weekend in Atlanta at the Carter Center, home of his post-presidential humanitarian work. He will then be flown on Monday to Washington, where he will lie in state at the Capitol. Thousands of people are expected to file through the Rotunda to pay their respects.</p><p>Carter rose from Georgia farmland to become the 39th U.S. president on a promise of healing the nation after the wounds of Watergate and Vietnam. He then lost the White House while dealing with economic turmoil at home and a hostage crisis in Iran.</p><p>Holding the “title of citizen,” Carter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/us/politics/jimmy-carter-post-presidency.html" title="">redefined what a former president can do</a>. While others generally held their tongues out of deference to the occupant of the Oval Office of the time, Carter rarely stood on ceremony and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/us/politics/jimmy-carter-successors.html" title="">was a thorn in the side of many of his successors</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A memorial for those killed in the plane crash at Muan International Airport in South Korea.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.

The House is set to choose a speaker on Friday. Given Republicans’ slim margin of control, his re-election is no sure thing.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ahmed al-Shara in Damascus, Syria.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ali Haj Suleiman/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-f2eadcf">Syria’s rebel leader hinted at a timetable for potential elections</h2><p>Syria’s de facto new leader <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-leader-elections.html" title="">said it could take up to four years to draft a constitution and hold elections</a>, offering the first potential timetable for a transition of power after the overthrow of the country’s longtime ruler, President Bashar al-Assad.</p><p>Ahmed al-Shara, who has been setting up an administration in Damascus after leading the rebel offensive that toppled al-Assad, reiterated that committees would be formed and specialized experts would be consulted.
