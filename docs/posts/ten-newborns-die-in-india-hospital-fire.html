Flames quickly engulfed the ward, which held 49 infants, Mr. Mahur said, speaking via telephone from the hospital. All the victims were less than a year old and on life support. Of those saved from the fire, 17 remained at the hospital, while others went home to their parents or were moved to another hospital, he said. A nurse also suffered burns.</p><p>“Some of the newborns who died were under observation after their treatment was over and to be sent home in the next day or two,” Mr. Mahur said. But the fire spread so quickly that it was impossible to save them, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Hospital fires are not uncommon in India. In May, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/26/world/asia/india-fire-death-infants-safety.html" title="">seven newborn babies lost their lives</a> in New Delhi when a fire broke out at the private neonatal clinic. In one of India’s worst such fires in 2011, 93 people died in a private hospital in Kolkata.</p><p>“Even though over a decade has elapsed since that disaster, no lessons seem to have been learnt because the frequency with which accidental fires keep breaking out in hospitals has not reduced,” wrote the authors of a 2023 study on fire accidents in India. The study found that despite new building codes and safety systems to prevent fires or reduce their severity, implementation remains lax.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Benarasiyaa/status/1857507153524736122" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Images</a> of the charred ward in Jhansi and of distraught parents were shared on social media. “Who will return my baby?” <a href="https://x.com/Benarasiyaa/status/1857499716692451623" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one cried</a> in front of TV cameras.</p><p>The government announced compensation of five hundred thousand rupees, or about $6,000, for <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/india/uttar-pradesh/jhansi-hospital-fire-up-govt-announces-financial-assistance-of-rs-5-lakh-for-parents-of-deceased-3279092" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">those parents who had lost their babies</a>.</p><p>India is woefully understaffed and underequipped to manage fire outbreaks. <a href="https://www.mha.gov.in/MHA1/Par2017/pdfs/par2019-pdfs/rs-26062019/516.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Data provided to the Parliament</a> in 2019 showed that the country had only 3,377 fire stations when regulations called for 8,559.
