When they get home, they share their photos and the positive information they found in Afghanistan.”</p><p>Taliban officials said they relied on tourists, especially bloggers and YouTubers, to extol the virtues of visiting Afghanistan. The Taliban government promotes tourism on its official websites and on social media, and Afghanistan’s 3,000 tourism agencies advertise overseas, they said.</p><p>Despite painful memories among Afghans of U.S. aerial bombings and night raids, American tourists are as welcome as anyone else, Mr. Ghofran said.</p><p>He said that guards were provided for tourists who requested security, but that visitors were not required to be accompanied by government escorts, as in North Korea.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>However, foreign businessmen and journalists — and many Afghans — are routinely monitored by agents of the General Directorate of Intelligence.</p><p>A small percentage of foreign visitors are women, tourism officials said. Both Mr. Ghofran and Mawlavi Ahmadullah Muttaqi, the information and culture director for Herat Province, said there were no written strictures governing how female tourists should dress and behave in public.</p><p>“They can see for themselves our culture here,” Mr. Muttaqi said, adding that female visitors should respect it by wearing long, concealing garments and covering their hair with a head scarf. They are not required to wear burqas or cover their faces, according to Mr. Muttaqi and Mr. Ghofran.</p><p>The distinctions between Afghan women and female tourists can be startling.</p><p>“I know <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/world/asia/afghanistan-taliban.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">women</a> are treated bad in Afghanistan, but as a woman, I see that everyone acts very nice to me,” said Marino Sakata, 23, a tourist from Japan who was traveling alone in Kabul and said she planned to return next year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Marino Sakata, a Japanese tourist, at the Sakhi Shah-e Mardan Shrine in Kabul.

She said she was considering buying a head scarf to better adhere to Afghan customs.</p><p>Pausing in conversation, she held up her smartphone to show a message through Google Translate: “Being a foreigner, I find it difficult that people stare at me.”</p><p>Male tourists, too, are expected to dress modestly, but they do not face the same intense scrutiny as women.</p><p>Greg Ernest, 67, a retired British consultant who visited Afghanistan for nine days last month, said the Afghan guide he hired told him to wear a shalwar kameez, the traditional clothes worn by Afghan men.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Ernest, who said he had visited every country in the world except Afghanistan before reaching Kabul, explained that he had been concerned about his safety when he arrived.</p><p>“I was slightly worried as a Brit,” he said, citing Britain’s prominent military role in the U.S.-led coalition. “But I was surprised at how well I was received. People were very hospitable.”</p><p>Tourists have visited from China, Russia, Ireland, Poland, Canada, Taiwan, Germany, France, Pakistan, Estonia, Sweden and elsewhere, tourism officials said. Travelers typically get their visa en route to Afghanistan, often at the Taliban-run consulates in Dubai or Peshawar, Pakistan.</p><p>Many venture to Bamiyan Province, west of Kabul, to see the remnants of the Buddha statues. Most tour the area uneventfully, but in May, three Spanish tourists and one Afghan were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/17/world/asia/spanish-tourists-killed-afganistan.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">killed</a> in the province.

Asked about the Buddhas, Hurmatullah Fazli, the acting tourism director in Bamiyan, replied, “Next question.”</p><p>Jin, a Chinese tourist who asked that his surname not be published, said the Buddhas held deep emotional resonance for many Chinese, who represent the world’s largest population of <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2015/04/02/buddhists/#:~:text=By%20a%20wide%20margin%2C%20China,people%20(18%25)%20were%20Buddhist." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Buddhists</a>, at 244 million.</p><p>He said he had dreamed for years of visiting the statues — and “then my heart was broken” when they were destroyed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Jin fought back tears as he stood amid the rubble of the Buddhas last month. “This place is sacred to us,” he said.</p><p>The Taliban’s <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1363272/Taliban-destroyed-museum-exhibits.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">destruction</a> of archaeological artifacts and ancient artworks at the National Museum of Afghanistan in Kabul in early 2001 is also a sensitive topic.
