He is expected to use the moment to make the case that his tariff policies, immigration crackdown and efforts to dismantle the federal bureaucracy are setting the country on a better path.</p><p>Not everyone sees it that way: The president’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/donald-trump-approval-rating-polls.html" title="">approval ratings</a> have steadily fallen. But there is no doubt that Trump’s return to the Oval Office has already been hugely consequential. “He has already changed the way America is perceived more than any president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt,” said Maggie Haberman, our White House correspondent.</p><p>Trump has proudly been a president of action. He has not allowed the traditional checks and balances of Congress and the courts to slow him down, issuing nearly as many executive orders in three months as Joe Biden did over four years. The result has been a chaotic blur of activity, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/us/trump-agenda-2025.html" title="">which we’ve tracked here</a>. We’ve also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/trump-100-days-fact-check.html" title="">fact-checked the president’s often-repeated claims</a>.</p><p>Trump’s reliance on executive orders has allowed him to move quickly, but at a risk. They can be overturned by a future president, and more easily challenged in the courts. In 100 days, his actions have prompted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/us/trump-administration-lawsuits.html" title="">well over 100 legal clashes</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>My colleagues in Washington took the president’s 100-day mark as an opportunity to reflect on what Trump’s presidency means so far. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/28/us/trump-100-days-actions.html" title="">Here’s where he has already made his mark</a>:</p><p><strong>Immigration: </strong>Trump fulfilled a signature campaign promise, essentially sealing the southern border with Mexico.
