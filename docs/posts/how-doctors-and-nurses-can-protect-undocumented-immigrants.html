It brought back the tumultuous months of 2017, defined by the first Trump administration’s travel bans and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/27/trumps-dangerous-scapegoating-immigrants" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vitriol against immigrants</a>. So many of our patients were terrified by the rhetoric; anxiety levels and blood pressure skyrocketed. But what seemed like an electoral aberration now feels like an American retrenchment. Tom Homan, tapped to become the so-called border czar, has promised “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/shock-awe-trump-border-czar-tom-homan-plans/story?id=115972346" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shock and awe</a>” on Day 1.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>To be sure, <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/biden-deportation-record" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">every presidential administration for the past 30 years has deported undocumented immigrants</a>, though mostly at or near the border. What feels different about this upcoming term — and why medical professionals will need to play a more active role in protecting their patients — is the scope. The specter of mass and potentially indiscriminate roundups feels more akin to the shameful internment of Japanese immigrants and Japanese American citizens during World War II.</p><p>Historically, health care workers have not always risen to the occasion when our patients have been targeted. Our recent history is tarnished by failures to report abuses or intervene at <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp048065" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay</a>, as well as by forced sterilizations of <a href="https://revealnews.org/article/female-inmates-sterilized-in-california-prisons-without-approval/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prisoners</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/08/magazine/eugenics-movement-america.html" title="">women of color</a> and <a href="https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/%C6%92.NWLC_SterilizationReport_2021.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">people with disabilities</a>.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
