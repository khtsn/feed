It also called for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/world/middleeast/pkk-leader-abdullah-ocalan.html" title="">Abdullah Ocalan</a>, the P.K.K.’s founder and leader who has been in a Turkish prison for a quarter-century, to be freed so he can oversee the group’s dissolution.</p><p>The P.K.K. announcement came two days after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/world/middleeast/turkey-pkk-abdullah-ocalan.html" title="">Mr. Ocalan said</a> that the group had outlived its life-span and should dissolve itself, a rare message from a leader with broad influence over Kurdish fighters in Turkey, but also around the region, including in Syria and Iraq.</p><p>The P.K.K. said in a statement carried by Firat News Agency, a P.K.K.-linked news site, that “none of our forces will take armed action unless attacked.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>If the P.K.K. does cease fighting, lay down its arms and disband, it would resolve a major domestic security threat and mark a political victory for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/world/middleeast/turkey-pkk-peace-deal-ocalan-erdogan.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a>. But there are still many unanswered questions about who would monitor a truce or what would happen to fighters who lay down their arms — or whether the government has offered the Kurdish fighters anything in return.</p><p>The Turkish government did not immediately comment on the P.K.K. statement or on the group’s call for Mr. Ocalan to be released.</p><p>Mr. Ocalan made his appeal after a series of talks between the main pro-Kurdish party in Turkey and Turkish officials. Mr. Erdogan said in January that the government had offered the P.K.K. no concessions.</p><p>The P.K.K. began as a secessionist group that sought to create an independent state for Turkey’s Kurdish minority, but more recently it has said it was seeking greater rights for Kurds inside Turkey.</p><p>Many Turks see Mr. Ocalan as one of the country’s biggest enemies. Turkey, the United States and other countries classify Mr. Ocalan as a terrorist and the P.K.K. as terror group for its attacks that have killed Turkish security forces and civilians.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Ocalan was convicted in 1999 of leading an armed terrorist group.</p><p>In recent years, Turkey’s military has degraded the P.K.K.’s fighting abilities, which analysts say may have contributed to its willingness to stop fighting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
