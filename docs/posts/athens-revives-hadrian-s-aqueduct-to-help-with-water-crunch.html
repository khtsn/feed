It also basically still works, carrying water from riverbanks and aquifers along a sloping route.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But after Athens’s first major dam was built in the early 20th century to meet a growing demand for water, the aqueduct was largely abandoned.</p><p>“It still works, but the water is wasted,” said Christos Giovanopoulos, a project manager at the local authority of Halandri, an Athens suburb that is a testing ground for the initiative. “It flows all the way to the central reservoir and then joins the sewage system and is expelled into the sea.

The eventual aim is to extend the project to another seven municipalities under which the aqueduct runs, saving over 250 million gallons of water per year, Mr. Giovanopoulos said.</p><p>This is a fraction of the more than 100 billion gallons of water used annually in Athens, those behind the pilot project acknowledge.

Its central reservoir is in a public square called Dexameni — Greek for reservoir — which draws crowds for an open-air cinema and a cafe that was a meeting point for Greek writers in the early 20th century.</p><p>“Ninety-five percent of customers don’t know the aqueduct exists,” said Nektarios Nikolopoulos, 48, the cafe’s owner. “They know Dexameni for the cafe, not its history.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A cafe at the Dexameni public square near the aqueduct’s central reservoir has long been a popular gathering spot.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Byron Smith for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“It still works, but the water is wasted,” Christos Giovanopoulos, a project manager working on the initiative, said of the aqueduct.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Byron Smith for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>So the local authorities partnered with a nonprofit group to raise awareness about the aqueduct by <a href="https://www.urbandigproject.org/single-post/%CF%80%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%80%CE%AD%CF%84%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF-%CE%B1%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%AC%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%BF-%CF%85%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%AF%CE%BF" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">leading tours of ground-level landmarks</a> like the central reservoir, which visitors can view through windows on its facade.</p><p>Yet hundreds of Halandri residents have been instrumental in getting the project off the ground.</p><p>Christina Christidou, 56, is one of about 250 residents who have applied to have their homes connected to the aqueduct water.
