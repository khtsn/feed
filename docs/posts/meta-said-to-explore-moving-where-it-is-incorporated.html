The process is at an early stage and no decision has been made, they added, and Meta’s corporate headquarters would remain in Menlo Park, Calif.</p><p>A spokesman for Meta declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/meta-incorporation-texas-delware-f06e8bab?mod=hp_lead_pos1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earlier reported</a> that the company might exit Delaware and reincorporate in Texas or elsewhere.</p><p>Since Meta was founded as Facebook in 2004, it has been incorporated in Delaware. Many shareholder lawsuits are filed in Delaware courts and Meta faces litigation there from a number of cases, including one stemming from a scandal over user privacy involving the voter profiling firm Cambridge Analytica in 2018.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Incorporating in another state that might be more favorable to companies rather than plaintiffs in class action lawsuits could help Meta in future shareholder litigation, the people said.</p><p>Last year, Elon Musk’s private rocket company, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/15/business/spacex-delaware-texas.html" title="">SpaceX</a>, switched where it was incorporated to Texas from Delaware. Mr. Musk made the move weeks after a Delaware judge voided his pay package at Tesla, the electric vehicle maker that he leads.</p><p>That case was brought by Tesla shareholders who were challenging a stock options package that allowed Mr. Musk to acquire about 304 million Tesla shares at a preset price if the company achieved certain goals. The judge ruled that Mr. Musk had effectively overseen his own compensation plan, valued at more than $50 billion at the time, with the help of compliant board members.</p><p>This is a developing story.
