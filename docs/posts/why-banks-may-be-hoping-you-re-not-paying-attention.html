A <a href="https://www.capitalone.com/about/newsroom/national-savings-day-2022/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> commissioned by Capital One found that many people check their savings account less than once a month, and about half don’t know what interest they are earning.</p><p>Is making a profit from customers’ inattentiveness illegal? Or just the normal business of being a bank?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Christopher Peterson, a law professor at the University of Utah who has worked for the consumer bureau on previous cases, said specific claims Capital One made on its original 360 Savings account, like advertising the account had a “top savings rate,” may mean the bank is liable for damages. By 2023 the rate was lower than the national average and one-tenth the rate of the 360 Performance Savings account.</p><p>One question raised by this case is whether Capital One<strong> </strong>had an obligation to continue offering a “top savings rate” on the original account years into the future. The bank’s advertising did not mention future rates. But the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, Mr. Peterson said, established that “a financial service provider could be held liable for taking unreasonable advantage of consumers’ inability to understand the products that they are being offered.”</p><p>The consumer bureau alleges that the bank instructed its branch employees not to volunteer information about the new account. And although customers were able to switch accounts at any time with no fee, the bank didn’t email its existing customers about the new account until the agency began its investigation.</p><p>Many customers probably don’t compare their savings account rates against what the Federal Reserve is doing. When the federal funds rate fell in 2020, Capital One’s 360 Savings rate fell along with it. But in 2022, when interest rates started to rise again, the 360 Savings rates never came close to highly competitive levels again. (The 360 Performance Savings account did increase its rates substantially.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-11"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="blatt-graphbank3" data-id="100000009965029" data-source-id="100000009965029"><div slug="blatt-graphbank3" data-sourceid="100000009965029" id="embed-id-100000009965029">

Scott Pearson, a lawyer who represents banks in regulatory matters, said the agency had “overstepped their authority” by suing Capital One.</p><p>Mr. Pearson noted that banks aren’t expected to alert customers every time they are eligible to refinance a mortgage. “There’s lots of case law saying that financial institutions don’t owe fiduciary obligations to their customers,” he said. “I don’t know why anyone would think that it’s the bank’s job to tell you that you can get a better deal somewhere else or that they’ll give you a better deal. That is just kind of a shocking and unprecedented theory in my view.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>For now, most of the largest banks feature nebulous advertising about saving for the future while offering extremely low interest rates.
