Their latest offensive has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/card/2025/01/27/world/africa/photos-rebels-goma-congo" title="">displaced over 500,000 people</a> since the beginning of the year, according to the United Nations refugee agency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>As the angry protests erupted in Kinshasa, gunshots rang out across Goma, 1,000 miles to the east, an area that was once a refuge for people fleeing M23’s advance as well as violence from other armed groups. Many are now fleeing again amid the M23 rebels’ fight to completely capture the city.</p><p>Rwanda denies supporting M23. Instead, it has accused Congo of failing to maintain peace in its eastern regions and threatening Rwanda’s own security by amassing troops near their border.</p><p>In a call on Monday with Congo’s president, Félix Tshisekedi, Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the M23 assault on Goma and affirmed U.S. respect for Congo’s sovereignty, according to Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokeswoman.</p><p>Amid widespread expectations that President Tshisekedi would address the nation on Tuesday and announce measures against the rebel offensive in the east, protesters voiced their anger at their leader, too, over what they perceived as his lack of strong reaction to the Rwanda-backed assault. “We’re wondering if there’s a president in our country,” said a protester, Dedieu du Ciel, who had broken into the Rwandan Embassy.</p><p>The U. N. Security Council was scheduled to hold an emergency meeting about the conflict on Tuesday. After an earlier emergency meeting on Sunday about the conflict, the council’s members did not mention Rwanda by name in their statement condemning the insurgency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The scene as protesters attacked the Rwandan Embassy in Kinshasa on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Samy Ntumba Shambuyi/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
