And by January, the Russian officers will start leaving.</p><p>This is the border between Iran and Armenia, a 30-mile strip that is a pivot point of a head-spinning geopolitical shift. Here in the Caucasus, the mountainous region where Europe meets Asia, Russia and Iran are increasingly seen as rivals, while Western countries are — surprisingly — finding some common cause with Tehran.</p><p>This complex, multicountry knot of interests and influences challenges Western conventional wisdom about alliances and could be upended yet again by the re-election of Donald J. Trump in the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a rare interview last week, Iran’s ambassador in Armenia, Mehdi Sobhani, acknowledged the diverging interests of Russia and Iran in the region, rather than the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-comprehensive-treaty-with-iran-will-include-defence-lavrov-says-2024-10-31/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“strategic partnership”</a> they often profess, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/19/world/europe/putin-ayatollah-erdogan-summit.html" title="">banding together</a> against the United States.</p><p>“We are not allies,” Mr. Sobhani said. “We have some differences, and we have some mutual interests. It doesn’t mean that we are allied.”</p><p>Armenia, a majority-Christian democracy, is at the center of the Russia-Iran rivalry. It is also unsettled by the prospect of renewed war with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/armenia-azerbaijan-clashes.html" title="">its archenemy, Azerbaijan</a>, which is taking a major step on the world stage this week by hosting global leaders for the annual United Nations climate conference <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/climate/cop29-baku-azerbaijan.html" title="">known as COP</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Armenia’s capital, Yerevan.

Complicating matters, some Western countries currently in conflict with Iran see their interests in the Caucasus — preventing war and reducing Russian influence — aligned with those of Tehran.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Markus Ritter, who heads a European Union mission monitoring Armenia’s borders, said the Iranians “are here in the region, the best friends of the Armenians.” While Russia and Azerbaijan bristle at the European presence, he said, Iran seems to accept it.</p><p>“It’s very complicated here,” he notes.</p><p>In the coming Trump presidency, Armenians fear, a harsher U.S. policy toward Iran could ricochet against their country and embolden Azerbaijan. If the current conflict between Iran and Israel, fueled by the fighting in Gaza and Lebanon, escalates into a full-scale war, they also worry that Tehran would be less able to protect Armenia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Until recently, many Armenians saw Russia as their guarantor. Russia was a haven during <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/23/world/europe/armenia-genocide-turkey-biden.html" title="">the Armenian genocide</a> a century ago. After the Soviet Union’s fall, Russia kept a military base in Armenia and guards at its borders. In 2020, when Azerbaijan waged a 44-day war against Armenia to retake the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/world/europe/nagorno-karabakh-putin-armenia-azerbaijan.html" title="">the mediation of President Vladimir V. Putin</a> and the deployment of Russian peacekeepers brought the fighting to an end.</p><p>But then Russia invaded Ukraine, leaving it distracted and weakened in the Caucasus. When Azerbaijan last year again attacked Nagorno-Karabakh — a breakaway Armenian enclave within Azerbaijani territory — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/21/world/europe/russia-armenia-azerbaijan-karabakh.html" title="">Russian forces stood by</a> and later departed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A military cemetery in Yerevan, where soldiers killed during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict are buried.

The road from Yerevan, the capital, passes berms, machine gun nests and Armenian flags on hilltops. It is bounded on both sides by Azerbaijani territory.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Clogging the winding road is a stream of Iranian trucks.</p><p>For the moment, the road is a key route north from the Persian Gulf and critical for exporting Iranian goods to Russia and to Europe. But it is also where Russia and Azerbaijan want to establish an east-west route toward Turkey that would be outside Armenia’s control — a route that Armenians fear Azerbaijan could take by force.</p><p>“It’s quite the peculiar situation,” said Alen Shadunts, an Iran specialist at the American University of Armenia. “Iran, on the one hand, is moving towards a strategic partnership with Russia in other areas, but in the South Caucasus, there is an evident disalignment of interests and positions.”</p><p>Armenia rejects the idea of any road or rail corridor on its territory that it does not control. Iran is also opposed, fearing the blocking of its northern border. When Russia’s foreign minister called on Armenia to accept the corridor in August, Iran summoned Russia’s ambassador in protest — a rare display of discord between Moscow and Tehran.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Trucks waiting to cross the Armenia-Iran border.

Still, officials in Moscow insist that the two countries remain united in opposing what both see as Western hegemony.</p><p>“Russia and Iran are allies in the broad sense of the word,” said Konstantin Zatulin, a Russian lawmaker, “which does not at all exclude some differences in the details.”</p><p>On Armenia’s southern border, however, the competition between Russia and Iran is playing out in real time. Russia’s domestic intelligence agency, the F.S.B., still patrols the frontier.</p><p>When a Times reporter and photographer visited this month, the border settlement of Agarak was celebrating its 75th anniversary.

Some current and former Armenian officials said there had been progress recently, but that Mr. Trump was a wild card.

E.U. leaders have been deepening ties with Azerbaijan, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/world/europe/azerbaijan-climate-summit-arrests.html" title="">despite human rights concerns</a>, because the oil- and gas-rich country provides alternatives to Russian energy. They also recognize the country’s importance to Israel, which gets much of its oil from Azerbaijan, sells weapons to Azerbaijan, and sees strategic value in having close ties with a neighbor of Iran.</p><p>Mr. Ritter, the E.U. mission chief, said that both Armenia and Azerbaijan were building bunkers, trenches and artillery positions “to prepare for the worst case.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Midway along Armenia’s narrow border with Iran, with Azerbaijan roughly 10 miles away, is the abandoned Soviet-era station of Meghri, where rusting train cars stand in the weeds, frozen in time.
