    <h1>Trump Media Stock Price Down 70% From March Peak</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The stock is also falling in advance of a pivotal date — the expiration of a contractual lockup that has precluded Mr. Trump from selling any of his shares. But on Sept. 19, he and other early investors can start selling shares, which could further depress Trump Media’s stock price.</p><p>Trump Media’s shares are now trading below the $17.50 price that the shell company it merged with, Digital World Acquisition Corporation, had at the start of the year. In January, investors began buying shares of Digital World in anticipation of the merger’s completion.</p><p>By the time the merger with Trump Media closed on March 25, Digital World shares had risen to nearly $40, and they peaked two days later above $66. But the shares, even at their current level, still trade at a sky-high valuation given that Trump Media is losing tens of millions of dollars each quarter and Truth Social is taking in meager advertising revenues.</p><p>Many of Trump Media’s shareholders are individual investors and supporters of the former president who originally bought shares of Digital World after the two companies announced plans for a merger in October 2021. Some bought in when shares of Digital World were trading near $90 in the initial wave of exuberance surrounding the deal.</p></div></div>
