    <h1>Geriatric Penguins Get a ‘Retirement Home’ at New England Aquarium</h1>

Their relocation is meant to address the large number of penguins at the aquarium who are living well beyond the age they would be expected to reach in the wild. About half of the aquarium’s 40 African penguins are older than the bird’s life expectancy of 10 to 15 years, Ms. McMahon said, and some have doubled it.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/17/multimedia/17xp-penguins-01-blpq/17xp-penguins-01-blpq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/17/multimedia/17xp-penguins-01-blpq/17xp-penguins-01-blpq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/17/multimedia/17xp-penguins-01-blpq/17xp-penguins-01-blpq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Penguin trainers in wet suits in the water with penguins and rocks in the background.

They are fed fish that have been injected with extra water to promote kidney health, and they get treatments such as eye drops and physical therapy. Some even get acupuncture.</p><p>“We wanted a space that was a little bit lower paced and more easily observed by the veterinarian team and our training team on a daily basis,” Ms. McMahon said.</p><p>African penguins are a critically endangered species, and conservationists say that they <a href="https://theconversation.com/african-penguins-could-be-extinct-by-2035-how-to-save-them-243384" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">could become extinct by 2035</a>. Wild penguins are found in the coastal waters of South Africa and Namibia, where they face threats that include the depletion of food from overfishing, climate change and pollution.</p><p>The life expectancy for wild African penguins likely does not reflect the reality for the species today, said Christina Hagen, the Pamela Isdell Fellow of Penguin Conservation at the organization BirdLife South Africa. (The group <a href="https://www.birdlife.org.za/what-we-do/seabird-conservation/what-we-do/coastal-seabird-conservation/creating-penguin-colonies-2/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is attempting to establish</a> an African penguin colony in the wild.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“The population is experiencing a high level of adult mortality,<em> </em>so<em> </em>it’s<em> </em>likely that they aren’t living that long,” Ms. Hagen said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>About half of the New England Aquarium’s 40 African penguins are older than the bird’s life expectancy of 10 to 15 years, and some have doubled it.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-13"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/14/17xp-penguins-kbhw-cover/17xp-penguins-kbhw-cover-square640.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/14/17xp-penguins-kbhw-cover/17xp-penguins-kbhw-cover-square640.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/03/14/135840_1_17xp-penguins-kbhw_wg_mobile_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The penguins are able to live so much longer because they do not face the same threats as wild birds and receive specialized care.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The New England Aquarium, a nonprofit conservation and research institution that is home to more than 10,000 marine animals, participates in efforts to protect and restore the wild African penguin populations. They sent one of their trainers to South Africa last year to help rehabilitate rescued wild African penguins and plan to send another trainer this year.</p><p>The penguins at New England Aquarium are able to live so much longer because they do not face the same threats as wild birds and receive specialized care, such as acupuncture.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Dr. Melissa Joblon, the aquarium’s director of animal health, said the acupuncture treatments, which are rare, are for penguins with arthritis in their spines, which causes them to stiffen and walk less.</p><p>The penguins are placed on a small table in a room with the lights turned down. The acupuncturist, who also does work on humans, places the needles on the penguin’s backs, hips and sometimes on the tops of their heads. “Some of them just go right to sleep with that<em>,” </em>Dr. Joblon said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-17"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>African penguins are a critically endangered species.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Conservationists say that they could become extinct by 2035.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>One of the penguins on the retirement island, and another who is about to move in, have undergone surgery to remove one of their eyes.</p><p>Dr. Joblon said the penguin Lambert, 32, had glaucoma that was causing pain and not getting better before his surgery. On the island for retired penguins, he has been able to chase his partner, Dyer, 14, around and become more comfortable navigating. “He’ll kind of bounce around the island like a younger bird,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>One other couple lives on the island (Harlequin, 32, and Durban, 31) and so do two females without mates (Boulder, 34, and Isis, 29). One of the females, Isis, had struggled to find her own space on the main colony while getting pushed around by more dominant birds. “This is an area that she can build her own space and feel more comfortable, hopefully, in her own home,” Dr. Joblon said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The penguins get special treatments, such as physical therapy and even acupuncture. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Aquarium workers are looking at ways to modify the island to make it easier for penguins with limited mobility to get around. They also hope it can be a useful space for younger birds to recover from medical issues.</p><p>The aquarium’s oldest African penguin, Good Hope, 35, and his mate, St. Croix, 23, are set to move to the island soon. After that, the aquarium does not have plans to move in other birds, Ms. McMahon said, and the plan is to let this group “live in harmony.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Amanda Holpuch covers breaking news and other topics.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div>
