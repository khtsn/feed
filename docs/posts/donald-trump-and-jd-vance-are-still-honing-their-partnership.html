Trump, has long kept for himself.</p><p>But instead of admonishing Mr. Vance, the former president has cheered him on.</p><p>When Mr. Vance botched a detail of one of the central issues of the 2024 election — incorrectly asserting that Mr. Trump would veto a national abortion ban — the former president calmly corrected the record and quickly moved on.</p><p>Mr. Vance eagerly welcomed the idea of a potential second debate with his Democratic counterpart, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, telling a rally crowd in Pennsylvania that debates showed which candidates were willing to work to earn the job. Mr. Trump, speaking at his rally in North Carolina about an hour earlier, flatly rejected an invitation for a rematch with Vice President Kamala Harris, unspooling a series of excuses including the <a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/pl4stRTbM2KlanTQvZyWHq_8IDv8ivp2LKJOU8u9uZql5K_CH9ciqnp_B9JG-zdsphKEhYPEuiB2EDQUtVqQqY83Aag?loadFrom=SharedClip&amp;ts=639.69&amp;te=644.85" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">time</a>, the <a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/SbiQ97zGNxbGoN69JvH5li3k06K0JkPpCVA22wdt2wzqywKOxitw7O8auaqESYKQFTfcCIhBRk4h3dtOgInTrrS8A3k?loadFrom=SharedClip&amp;ts=604.86&amp;te=625.56" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">place</a> and his unresolved <a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/FH-0wYYcUQ44NSTv8zhO_IEB7PLNcA3cS7BQ3EVuIz2UF2IhrbSq6yVB5J3S45gO92oosmgyeWU5-_cfuSiy37-fQYU?loadFrom=SharedClip&amp;ts=625.56&amp;te=634.71" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grievances</a> from their first meeting.</p><p>Again, no public shaming. No punishment. Not a hint of anxiety over the dichotomy.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s unusual willingness to overlook his apprentice’s missteps is an early indication of a unique partnership developing with Mr. Vance. The former president seems to be enjoying a more collaborative role with someone he views as a kindred political spirit to help lead his MAGA movement back into the White House — even as the number of Americans <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/jd-vance/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who say they dislike Mr. Vance</a> continues to climb.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>This account of their relationship is based on interviews with aides for both men, their allies and other Republicans who have witnessed recent interactions between the party’s presidential and vice-presidential nominees.</p><p>Mr. Vance’s role in this relationship will be on display Tuesday when he meets Mr. Walz for the only scheduled vice-presidential debate of the year — and the stakes couldn’t be higher. It will likely be the largest single audience Mr. Vance will address this campaign, and yet, for him, only one spectator will truly matter.</p><p>Mr. Vance, 40, has spoken of Mr. Trump, 78, as a kind of father figure, albeit one who can call multiple times in a day and at any hour.</p><p>Some of those calls from Mr. Trump were check-ins and encouragement during the onslaught of criticism over Mr. Vance’s complaints of too many “childless cat ladies” among American leaders, including Ms. Harris. Mr. Trump urged Mr. Vance to hold his ground and fight through the attacks. Democrats have seized on Mr. Vance’s socially conservative views to paint the Republican ticket as weirdly out of touch, while Mr. Trump and his team view him as an ideal messenger to motivate the working-class base of voters they need to win in November.</p><p>Mr. Vance has spoken publicly about another call in which Mr. Trump heard him trying to quiet his 7-year-old son, Ewan, and asked to speak with the boy. When Mr. Vance put his eldest child on the phone, the former president asked the youngster for feedback on a campaign statement he was preparing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Vance has also hinted, albeit jokingly, at what would be an understandable fear of Mr. Trump’s demanding style and hair-trigger wrath, while recounting how he initially missed the call when the former president phoned to offer him the V.P. slot.</p><p>“I call him back, he answers the phone and says, ‘JD, you missed a very important phone call — and now I might have to pick somebody else,’” Mr. Vance recalled last week in North Carolina. “So I almost have a heart attack right there.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Vance and Mr. Trump talk frequently, but Mr. Vance does not check each decision with Mr. Trump.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jenn Ackerman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Trump-Vance partnership remains, undoubtedly, a fledgling one. The two men first met only a few years ago, when Mr. Vance commenced a political career and needed to make amends for his venomous past as a Never Trumper.</p><p>Long-term security is more of a bug than a feature in any Trump relationship. The former president has treated his closest family and friends mercurially and has a history of dispassionately abandoning longtime allies — including his previous running mate, former Vice President Mike Pence — when it suits his political purpose.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Lee Zeldin, a Republican and former congressman from New York who is close with both men, said Mr. Trump easily jelled with his running mate thanks in part to personal testimonials from family and longtime advisers who attested to Mr. Vance’s political conversion and reliability.</p><p>Their trust quickly deepened, Mr. Zeldin said, over a mutual affection for economic populism, staunch anti-immigration policy and a restrained approach to international affairs — plus a similar instinct for the jugular on the campaign trail.</p><p>“They’re friends, and they have a very strong relationship,” Mr. Zeldin said. “They’re more like buddies or confidants who can be frank with each other and enjoy the time they spend together.”</p><p>But while Mr. Trump has not publicly crowned Mr. Vance as the heir apparent to his red-capped conservative movement, he has never stopped his campaign from describing his running mate that way since joining the ticket two months ago.</p><p>“Senator Vance reinforces President Trump’s worldview and shows there is a strong carrier of this movement to fight for American workers and take away the power from the entrenched elites,” said Jason Miller, a senior adviser for the Trump campaign. Mr. Trump also has a deep respect for Mr. Vance’s willingness to fight for the ticket on television, Mr. Miller added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Trump has let Mr. Vance freelance in ways he has rarely entrusted to other allies. The two men talk frequently, but Mr. Vance does not check each decision with Mr. Trump — the former president values that as a sign that Mr. Vance has confidence and that he’s not “needy and high maintenance,” according to one Trump aide.</p><p>But the latitude Mr. Trump has afforded his running mate has led to some potentially uncomfortable moments, most recently over the Vance-led offensive against Haitian migrants.</p><p>The attacks drove headlines for days and threatened to make a Trump campaign that has promised to prioritize mass deportations from the White House appear even more radical and extreme. The Haitian migrants who suddenly found themselves the target of baseless claims that they were eating their neighbors’ pets are not an example of illegal border crossings. They are lawfully living in the United States with Temporary Protected Status, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/us/haitian-migrants-springfield-ohio.html" title="">a federal designation</a> to protect people from a country in crisis.</p><p>But Mr. Trump was never remotely upset. Instead, he joined in. In front of a televised audience of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/business/media/harris-trump-debate-ratings.html" title="">67 million people</a> who tuned in two weeks ago for his debate with Ms. Harris, he pushed the attacks even further than Mr. Vance.</p><p>“They’re eating the dogs, the people that came in — they’re eating the cats, they’re eating the pets of the people that live there,” Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/podcasts/the-daily/ohio-immigrants-pets.html?showTranscript=1" title="">said</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>After the debate, Mr. Vance left the media filing center in Philadelphia and inadvertently encountered Mr. Trump. Standing amid lighting fixtures and boxes of unused equipment stacked on the back side of a blue curtain, the two men briefly huddled, as if they were a pair of everyday buddies.</p><p>Mr. Trump noted that he was going to talk to reporters. Awesome, Mr. Vance told him, adding that he was heading to a cable news interview. Awesome, Mr. Trump responded. They compared notes on the debate and incoming questions from the media. When they parted ways, Mr. Trump gave his running mate an encouraging pat on the shoulder.</p><p>“Go get ‘em,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Vance.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael C.
