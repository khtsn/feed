But during that time, the company will carry out a restructuring plan that will include the loss of more than 35,000 jobs through retirement and attrition.</p><p>In exchange, the union, IG Metall, which represents most of Volkswagen’s workers, withdrew its demand for a wage increase until 2031 and agreed to cuts in bonuses and reductions in production of hundreds of thousands of cars across several plants.</p><p>“No site will be closed, no one will be made redundant, and our company wage agreement will be secured for the long term,” Daniela Cavallo, the head of the works council at Volkswagen, said in a statement announcing the agreement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At stake was not just wages but Volkswagen’s plans to solve the problem of too many workers and too few orders, amid slumping demand in Europe and abroad and increasing competition from Chinese automakers.</p><p>Volkswagen’s woes have mirrored <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/world/europe/germany-government-collapse-economy.html" title="">Germany’s economic malaise</a>. Officials in the country have forecast that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/business/germany-economy-budget-elections.html" title="">the economy will contract in 2024</a>, for the second consecutive year. Economists do not expect to see a significant return to growth in 2025.</p><p>The extended wage dispute had strained the 87-year-old automaker’s strong ties with its roughly 120,000 workers in Germany, who said management had betrayed the social pact of the country’s traditional collective bargaining system, where the welfare of the company and its employees are given equal weight.</p><p>Some 100,000 IG Metall members staged brief walkouts in December. The union had threatened to start longer strikes starting in January if an agreement had not been reached.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>That pressure, combined with Volkswagen’s plunging share price, which has fallen by more than a third over the past 12 months, was enough to force the company to back down from its threats to close as many as three plants. Volkswagen had also initially sought a 10 percent wage cut.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Volkswagen plant in Emden, Germany.

The fund can be drawn from to compensate those employees whose hours are reduced or who are forced into early retirement through the restructuring.</p><p>Volkswagen said the deal would save more than 4 billion euros, or roughly $4.2 billion, annually in the coming years. It would also reduce its production capacity by 734,000 cars over the coming five years, allowing the company to invest in new products that it hopes will restore its ability to compete.</p><p>“I think it sends a good signal to the work force and creates confidence that the employees are valued,” said Beatrix C. Keim, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Duisburg, adding that it was good for Germany’s auto industry because many suppliers and their employees depend on Volkswagen’s success.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The agreement was a sorely needed positive end to a difficult year, coming days after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/europe/germany-scholz-no-confidence-vote.html" title="">Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany lost a vote of confidence</a> in Parliament, setting off new elections in February that are shaping up to focus largely on how to jump-start the country’s stagnant economy.</p><p>High energy prices, a complex bureaucracy, aging public infrastructure and geopolitical developments have hurt exports, while political paralysis under Mr. Scholz’s government exacerbated the situation.</p><p>The threat of further protectionism from the administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump in the United States has economists worried that the coming year could be more challenging, even if a new German government is able to quickly enact some badly needed reforms.</p><p>Volkswagen is struggling against falling demand in Europe and China, the world’s largest car market, and is burdened by high costs for labor and electricity, especially in Germany. In October, the company reported that profit fell to €2.86 billion, or $3.1 billion, for the months from August to September, its lowest level in three years.</p><p>On Friday, Volkswagen’s top shareholder, Porsche, said it might have to write down the value of its 31.9 percent stake in the company by as much as €20 billion, or $21 billion, creating extra pressure on Volkswagen’s management to reach an agreement that included cost cuts.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Melissa Eddy is based in Berlin and reports on Germany’s politics, businesses and its economy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/melissa-eddy">More about Melissa Eddy</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
