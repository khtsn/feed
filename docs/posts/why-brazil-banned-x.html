When his online crackdown helped stifle far-right efforts to overturn Brazil’s election, <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2023/11/celso-rocha-de-barros-diz-na-flip-que-stf-ajudou-a-salvar-o-futuro-da-democracia.shtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">academics</a> and <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/joel-pinheiro-da-fonseca/2023/06/nossa-democracia-so-sobreviveu-gracas-a-alexandre-de-moraes-e-as-forcas-armadas.shtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">commentators</a> wondered whether the nation had found a possible solution to one of the most vexing problems of modern democracy.</p><p>Then, on Friday, Justice Moraes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/world/americas/brazil-elon-musk-x-blocked.html" title="">blocked the social network X</a> across Brazil because its owner, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/07/world/americas/brazil-politics-elon-musk-republicans.html" title="">Elon Musk</a>, had ignored his court orders to remove accounts. As part of the blackout order, the judge said internet users who tried to circumvent his measure in order to keep using X could be fined nearly $9,000 a day, or more than what the average Brazilian makes a year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It was the judge’s boldest measure yet, and it left even many of his defenders worried that Brazil’s experiment had gone too far.</p><p>“I was someone who was very on his side,” said David Nemer, a Brazilian-born media professor who has studied his nation’s approach to disinformation at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University.</p><p>“But when we saw the X decision, we were like: ‘What the hell? This is too much,’” he said, using an expletive. “It was a warning to all of us.”</p><p>Brazil’s yearslong fight against the internet’s destructive effect on politics, culminating in the current blackout of X, shows the pitfalls of a nation deciding what can be said online. Do too little and allow online chatter to undermine democracy; do too much and restrict citizens’ legitimate speech.</p><p>Other governments worldwide are likely to be watching as they debate whether to wade into the messy work of policing speech or leave it to increasingly powerful tech companies that rarely share a country’s political interests.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The United States had long largely stayed out of the debate, letting tech companies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/16/technology/twitter-donald-trump-jack-dorsey.html" title="">police themselves</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/technology/apple-google-parler.html" title="">one another</a>. But this year it changed course, passing a law to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/tiktok-ban.html" title="">ban TikTok</a> unless it was sold to a government-approved buyer because of concerns over its parent company’s ties to China. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/07/business/tiktok-ban-appeal.html" title="">TikTok has sued</a> to challenge the law as unconstitutional.</p><p>The European Union approved sweeping legislation in 2022 requiring social networks to adhere to specific rules about what can be posted on their sites. And only days ago, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/business/telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-charged.html" title="">France charged Pavel Durov</a>, the Russian-born entrepreneur who founded the messaging service Telegram, with a wide range of crimes for failing to prevent illicit activity on the app.</p><p>But few democratic governments have taken as drastic a step as Brazil’s suspension of X and its threat of fines against people who keep using it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elon Musk, the owner of X, in May in Beverly Hills, Calif.

At first on Friday, he ordered Apple and Google to prevent downloads of apps that offer virtual private networks, or VPNs, software that can cause a user’s internet traffic to appear as though it were coming from another country. VPNs are commonly used for privacy and cybersecurity, but can also be used to evade blockades against certain websites or apps.</p><p>The measure against VPN apps prompted a swift backlash across Brazil, and three hours later, Justice Moraes amended the order to drop his demand to Apple and Google.</p><p>But Justice Moraes retained the threat of fining anyone who continued to use X in Brazil via VPN. That move “is absolutely authoritarian, and there is no explicit legal provision that allows for it,” <a href="https://x.com/thiamparo/status/1829639239216050421?t=USP0GWEQ4maaT4VrQMlG3g&amp;s=19" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Thiago Amparo, a prominent Brazilian lawyer and newspaper columnist who has supported Justice Moraes.</p><p>The head of Brazil’s national bar association said on Friday that the organization would ask Brazil’s Supreme Court to review the measure about fines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Justice Moraes’s support in Brazil has faded as the nation has moved past the acute tensions of the 2022 election. At the time, then-President Jair Bolsonaro was using social media <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/25/world/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-misinformation.html" title="">to sow doubts</a> about the integrity of Brazil’s voting systems, despite a lack of evidence, and Justice Moraes was ordering social networks to remove some of his posts.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Broken windows at Brazil’s Supreme Court in Brasília after it was attacked and vandalized in 2023 by supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who did not accept the results of the 2022 general election.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor Moriyama for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>After Mr. Bolsonaro lost the election, thousands of his supporters blocked highways, camped outside army bases and eventually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/08/world/americas/brazil-election-protests-bolsonaro.html" title="">stormed Brazil’s Congress</a> and Supreme Court in a bid to provoke a military takeover. Justice Moraes responded by ordering social networks to block dozens of prominent accounts that questioned the vote or sympathized with the attempted insurrection, including some belonging to federal lawmakers.</p><p>But since then, as the political temperature has cooled, Justice Moraes has kept issuing court orders to social networks to remove accounts. The orders are both secret and lack explanations on how a certain account had broken the law, according to leaked copies of orders.</p><p>“Moraes’ actions were very much legitimized by the need to protect the Constitution,” said Mariana Valente, a lawyer and director of Brazil’s InternetLab, a think tank. “But obviously there’s concern that this is continuing.”</p><p>She said Brazil’s full Supreme Court should rule soon on Justice Moraes’s order to block X. “That is essential to create legitimacy for a decision that’s very extreme,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Justice Moraes has continued to use the threat to democracy as a justification for his actions. In his order on Friday, he said Mr. Musk’s refusal to comply with orders to suspend accounts “represents an extremely serious risk to the municipal elections in October” in Brazil.</p><p>Justice Moraes has “set up a state of exception,” Mr. Nemer said. “But it’s a permanent state of exception, and that’s not good for any sort of democracy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-17"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jack Nicas is the Brazil bureau chief for The Times, based in Rio de Janeiro, where he leads coverage of much of South America.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jack-nicas">More about Jack Nicas</a></span></p></div><div><p>Kate Conger is a technology reporter based in San Francisco.
