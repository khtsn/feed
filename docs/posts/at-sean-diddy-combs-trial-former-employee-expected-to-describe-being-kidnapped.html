On Thursday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/arts/music/kid-cudi-sean-combs-diddy-trial.html" title="">Mr. Mescudi gave his account</a> of Mr. Combs’s jealous meltdown, which he said escalated to his Porsche being set on fire with a Molotov cocktail in early 2012.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Lawyers for Mr. Combs, who has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges, have denied Mr. Combs’s involvement in any kidnapping or arson — and have said there was never any criminal conspiracy. They assert that Ms. Ventura and another woman that Mr. Combs is accused of sex trafficking are not victims, but rather former girlfriends who agreed to participate in sex that, while “kinky,” was entirely consensual and legal.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Mr. Combs, is expected to testify this week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">U.S. Attorney&#39;s Office for the Southern District of New York</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The kidnapping accusations are meant to buttress the racketeering conspiracy charge against Mr. Combs, which accuses him and members of his inner circle of a series of crimes dating back to 2004. The crimes cited in the indictment include sex trafficking, arson, drug violations, bribery, obstruction of justice and two acts of kidnapping — both of them involving Ms. Clark.</p><p>In the defense’s opening statement, Teny Geragos, one of Mr. Combs’s lawyers, began their effort to undercut the kidnapping accusations, saying that more than a decade after Ms. Clark says she was kidnapped, she asked to work for Mr. Combs again.</p><p>“As you listen to her testimony and evaluate: Was this person actually kidnapped?” Ms. Geragos told the jury at the start of the trial.</p><p>Previous witnesses in the case have described Ms. Clark as a former assistant of Mr. Combs who spent time working with his fashion label, Sean John, and also helped Ms. Ventura with her music career.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Prosecutors have said that the second instance of kidnapping occurred when Ms. Clark was taken by Mr. Combs’s bodyguards to sit through “days of lie-detector tests.”</p><p>David James, a former assistant to Mr. Combs who testified last week, foreshadowed the details of that incident.</p><p>Mr. James testified that he had been told that when Ms. Clark was an assistant, she was carrying Mr. Combs’s jewelry bag when she was robbed. To prove that she wasn’t a part of the “heist,” Mr. James said, Ms. Clark was subjected to a lie-detector test.</p><p>Two weeks into the trial, the witnesses have largely been aimed at corroborating Ms. Ventura’s account of rampant physical abuse and sexual encounters known as “freak-offs,” which she gave during four days of testimony at the start of the case.</p><p>The witnesses that followed have included people who say they witnessed Mr. Combs’s physical abuse of Ms. Ventura or its aftermath and two men who were paid to have sex with Ms. Ventura while Mr. Combs watched. Law enforcement officials have also described for the jury the searches they made of Mr. Combs’s property during the criminal investigation.</p><p>On Tuesday, more law enforcement officials are expected to take the stand, this time from the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles Fire Department.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
