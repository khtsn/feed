Biden Jr. and his staff in Mr. Trump’s latest attempt to stoke outlandish conspiracy theories about his predecessor.</p><p>In an executive order, Mr. Trump put the power and resources of the federal government to work examining whether some of Mr. Biden’s presidential actions were legally invalid because his aides had enacted those policies without his knowledge.</p><p>The executive order came after Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/01/us/politics/trump-biden-conspiracy-theory.html" title="">shared a social media post</a> over the weekend that claimed Mr. Biden had been “executed in 2020” and replaced by a robotic clone, following a pattern of suggestions by the president and his allies that Mr. Biden was a mentally incapacitated puppet of his aides.</p><p>The former president called such claims “ridiculous and false” in a statement on Wednesday after the order’s release.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency,” he said. “I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation and proclamations.”</p><p>The order comes after disclosure in recent weeks that Mr. Biden, 82, had received a diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer and in the wake of renewed scrutiny of his health during his presidency.</p><p>Since his return to office, Mr. Trump has embarked on a campaign of retribution against his perceived enemies, with Mr. Biden as a key target. He has moved to strip Mr. Biden’s security clearance and ordered investigations into the Biden administration’s handling of a range of issues.</p><p>But the ordered inquiry into a conspiracy theory about the former president himself was a startling escalation.</p><p>“The White House issued over 1,200 presidential documents, appointed 235 judges to the federal bench, and issued more pardons and commutations than any administration in United States history,” the executive order said, after asserting that “former President Biden’s aides abused the power” of his office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A central claim of the conspiracy theory, as described by Mr. Trump himself, is that Mr. Biden’s use of the autopen system — which reproduces a person’s signature to be affixed to official documents — can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/business/media/autopen-biden-trump-conspiracy-theory.html" title="">legally invalidate those documents</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump has claimed, for example, that some pardons Mr. Biden had made during his time in office were invalid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/autopen-pardons-biden-trump.html" title="">because they were signed using an autopen</a>. (There is no power in the Constitution or case law to undo a pardon.)</p><p>Mr. Trump has acknowledged that his administration uses the autopen system on occasion. But his executive order asserts without evidence that the Biden administration’s own use of the system may have “implications for the legality and validity” of some of Mr. Biden’s actions as president.</p><p>The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel had weighed in on this issue at the request of President George W. Bush in 2005.</p><p>Howard C. Nielson Jr., the top official at the Office of Legal Counsel, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/494411/dl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">concluded that</a> “the president need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law.” He added that the president could instead direct “a subordinate to affix the president’s signature to such a bill, for example by autopen.”</p><p>Mr. Nielson is now a Federal District Court judge in Utah, <a href="https://www.deseret.com/2017/9/28/20620445/howard-c-nielson-jr-nominated-to-be-federal-judge-in-utah/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nominated to the position by Mr. Trump during his first term</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Chris Cameron is a Times reporter covering Washington, focusing on breaking news and the Trump administration.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Emergency Abortions</strong><strong>:</strong> The Trump administration announced that it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/us/politics/trump-emergency-abortion-rule.html">revoked a Biden administration requirement</a> that hospitals provide emergency abortions to women whose health is in peril, including in states where abortion is restricted or banned.</p></li><li><p><strong>Crucial Global Vaccination Programs: </strong>The Trump administration’s proposed budget for the coming fiscal year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/health/trump-budget-global-health-polio.html">eliminates funding for programs that provide lifesaving vaccines</a> around the world, including immunizations for polio.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump and Antisemitism:</strong> President Trump’s effort to punish Harvard over antisemitism is complicated by his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/us/politics/trump-antisemitism.html">extensive history of amplifying white supremacist figures and symbols</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Science Funding: </strong>Thousands of scientists, academics, physicians and researchers have responded to the administration’s executive order about “restoring a gold standard for science,” which puts Trump’s political appointees in charge of vetting scientific research and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/climate/executive-order-gold-standard-science.html">gives them the authority to “correct scientific information</a>.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Kennedy Center: </strong>Ticket sales and subscription revenue at the John F.
