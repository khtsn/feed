    <h1>Inside the Sally Rooney Fan Base</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>On Wednesday, a crowd of mostly young women, many carrying bookstore tote bags, filled a venue on the bank of the River Thames. They — we — were there to hear the Irish novelist Sally Rooney discuss “Intermezzo,” her latest novel.</p><p>Rooney is a literary star, and each new release is a highly anticipated and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/style/sally-rooney-book-merch.html" title="">heavily marketed</a> cultural event. Fans attend <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/books/sally-rooney-intermezzo.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">midnight release parties</a>. The lucky few who get advance copies wield them as status symbols on social media. “I did post the book,” a 26-year-old Rooney fan told me. “Everyone knows I’m obsessed with her.”</p><p>Rooney’s writing embodies a kind of cool that feels of the moment. Her style is unforced, spare and incisive — the literary equivalent of Gen Z’s habit of omitting capital letters from text messages, or the doe-eyed, bored poses of influencers on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CfWu2EcOcA_/?img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a>. “If writing is almost too effusive, too emotional, it becomes a bit cliché,” another fan told me. “I think her writing feels really fresh because it’s pared back.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The simplicity of Rooney’s language is part of its power. Her most emotionally resonant sentences have word counts in the single digits, and they arise in mundane situations. “Normal People,” Rooney’s second novel, is about two young people, Connell and Marianne, who are negotiating their relationship, with its various power imbalances, while feeling out their place in the world. I think about this scene a lot:</p><blockquote><p>“She smiled, rubbed at her nose. He unzipped his black puffer jacket and put it over her shoulders. They were standing very close. She would have lain on the ground and let him walk over her body if he wanted, he knew that.”</p></blockquote><p>Many of the Rooney fans I spoke with at the book talk on Wednesday — all in their late 20s — praised the emotional truth of her writing. “I couldn’t believe that somebody had written something that I related to so much,” a fan said of “Normal People.” Rooney’s books deal in the fraught business of interpersonal relationships — the difficulty of vulnerability, miscommunication, understanding one’s own power over another. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At an “Intermezzo” midnight release party in Brooklyn.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ye Fan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Her characters often consider their political and social context, what it means to be young and to be in love right now, at a time when connection can be difficult and things appear to be falling apart. In Rooney’s third novel, “Beautiful World, Where Are You,” the character Alice writes to her best friend, Eileen:</p><blockquote><p>“I think of the twentieth century as one long question, and in the end we got the answer wrong. Aren’t we unfortunate babies to be born when the world ended?”</p></blockquote><p>At the event, I found myself thinking about Taylor Swift and the Eras Tour, which I attended a couple of weeks ago. There are, of course, considerable differences between Rooney and Swift. Yet their fan bases are demographically similar — there is certainly overlap — and they share a desire to see themselves in their idol’s work. I thought, then, about how few avenues Rooney’s fans, as opposed to Swift’s, had to connect to her. A key part of Swift’s appeal is her willingness to narrate her life as it happens. She courts her fans’ investment not only in her work but in herself. Swift is an active participant in her celebrity. </p><p>Rooney seems quite removed from the hype that surrounds her career. She’s made clear her discomfort with publicity and the idea of books as a commodity, and she guards details about her personal life, and often objects to claims that her work is a reflection of personal experience. “I don’t have any interest in marketing my books,” <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/magazines/culture-magazine/article/sally-rooney-interview-intermezzo-vbt23j7q7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she told The Times of London</a>. “I certainly don’t answer interview questions with the intention of selling my book.”<span>  </span>At the talk on Wednesday, one fan, jokingly, lamented how difficult it was to develop a parasocial relationship with Rooney.</p><p>Rooney’s debut, “Conversations with Friends,” was released when she was just 26. She published “Normal People” a year later, and it was adapted into a popular television series, which seemed to turbocharge her career. Both novels concerned the lives of university students. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In London.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ben Stansall/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Rooney is now 33. “Intermezzo,” her latest novel, is about two brothers grieving the loss of their father. One is a 22-year-old former chess prodigy who begins a relationship with an older woman. The other is a 32-year-old lawyer romantically involved with a younger woman. Critics have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/books/review/intermezzo-sally-rooney-review-roundup.html" title="">largely praised the book</a>, many highlighting a new maturity in Rooney’s writing.</p><p>The change is welcomed by an audience that is growing older alongside her. A fan, a 28-year-old Instagram book reviewer, told me that she could map her life onto those of Rooney’s characters. “I love that she’s writing books that I feel like I can connect with each time she publishes them,” she said.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-33ffbf21">Middle East</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Beirut, Lebanon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><ul><li><p>The Israeli military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/29/world/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-nasrallah/here-are-the-latest-developments?smid=url-share" title="">struck several targets near Beirut</a>, Lebanon’s capital, including buildings that it said were used for storing weapons.

We spoke about why he doesn’t consider himself a journalist, not giving in to nihilism, and what he’s learned over a decade of making the show.</em></p><p><strong>It’s funny going back to the first season as a viewer.

It might have been in the first season, we did one story called “Prison,” and it was about 16 minutes, and that seemed like a long time at the time. And I think what we gradually learned was, it is crazy to try and talk about all the problems with prisons in 16 minutes, especially if two of those minutes are going to be a song with “Sesame Street” characters at the end. So, since then, we’ve basically come back and redone that story in 20 different ways. We’ve talked about prison labor, prison phone calls, prison recidivism, prison re-entry. There are so many different aspects to criminal justice. You can’t just slap “prisons” on it and say, “Oh, we’ve done it now.” I look back at that and <em>do </em>slightly wince.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/magazine/john-oliver-interview.html" title=""><em>Read more of the interview here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id="link-640bc3b8"><span><strong>THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Photograph by PEDEN+MUNK for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rachel Vanni for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p>In this week’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/dining/no-plates-allowed.html" title="">Five Weeknight Dishes newsletter</a>, Margaux Laskey admits that the kid wrangling, lunch packing and commuting of the back-to-school season has tired her out.
