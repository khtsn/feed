data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Even before news of Mayor Eric Adams’s indictment was made public on Wednesday, prominent elected officials had already called for his resignation, most notably Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. But after the news of the mayor’s indictment, the calls for his resignation promptly surged. Mr. Adams is not required to resign.</p><p>Scott Stringer, the former New York City comptroller who is among the Democrats running against Mr. Adams in next year’s Democratic primary, said on Wednesday night that the mayor needed to “resign for the good of the city,” repeating a line <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/nyregion/aoc-eric-adams-resign.html" title="">used by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez</a>.</p><p>“There is simply zero chance that the wheels of government will move forward from this full steam ahead,” Mr. Stringer said in a statement. “Instead, we are left with a broken down train wreck of a municipal government.”</p><p>Brad Lander, the current New York City comptroller, who is also running for mayor, echoed the sentiment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Mayor Adams, like all New Yorkers, deserves due process, the presumption of innocence, and his day in court,” he <a href="https://x.com/bradlander/status/1839113390213755214" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X. “However, it is clear that defending himself against serious federal charges will require a significant amount of the time and attention needed to govern this great city. The most appropriate path forward is for him to step down so that New York City can get the full focus its leadership demands.”</p><p>Zellnor Myrie, a state senator from Brooklyn who is also running for mayor against Mr. Adams, joined the chorus. “We need a leader who is fully focused, without distraction, on the enormous challenges we face — from housing affordability to public safety,” Mr. Myrie wrote on X. “A mayor under the weight of a serious indictment can no longer do that — and today I am calling on him to resign.”</p><p>Councilman Shekar Krishnan, who represents a district in Queens, said Mr. Adams “will absolutely be unable to lead from inside a courtroom. He must resign.”</p><p>State Senator John Liu, another Queens Democrat, said New Yorkers “need a mayor who is able to devote full time and full energy to putting the city on the right track, including recruitment and retention of top leadership for the city.” He added: “Mayor Adams is simply unable to do that for the foreseeable future and therefore, for the good of all New Yorkers, must resign immediately.”</p><p>Other elected officials who have called for Mr. Adams to step down include State Senators Gustavo Rivera, Julia Salazar and Jabari Brisport; City Councilmembers Tiffany Cabán and Alexa Avilés; and Assemblymembers Emily Gallagher and Phara Souffrant Forrest.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Dana Rubinstein covers New York City politics and government for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/dana-rubinstein">More about Dana Rubinstein</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/eric-adams-mayor-nyc">Eric Adams</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/alexandria-ocasio-cortez">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/scott-stringer">Scott Stringer</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/brad-lander">Brad Lander</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
