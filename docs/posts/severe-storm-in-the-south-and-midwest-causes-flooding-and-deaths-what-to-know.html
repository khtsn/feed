Many of the hardest-hit places were riverside cities and towns that have seen catastrophic flooding before.</p><p>Rivers continued to rise even after the worst of the storm had moved on. “Given the fact that everything is so saturated, everything is just running right off the ground and into area creeks and streams,” Nate McGinnis, a Weather Service meteorologist in Wilmington, Ohio, said on Saturday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Dozens of rivers from Arkansas to Indiana were flooding on Sunday, threatening bridges, levees, water and sewage systems, and other infrastructure. Some streams and rivers were not expected to crest for several more days. Stranded residents were rescued across the region.</p><p>The still-rising Kentucky River swamped the streets of Frankfort, Ky., the state capital, on Sunday, and residents were waiting anxiously for the nearby river to crest. The city’s flood wall can withstand 51 feet, but the Weather Service predicted that the river would crest at 49.5 feet.</p><p>Elsewhere, parts of Shelbyville, Ind., and all of Falmouth, Ky., were under mandatory evacuation orders. Some neighborhoods of Nashville were awash. Floodwaters in Mammoth Springs, Ark., washed out a railroad line on Saturday and derailed a freight train.</p><h2 id="link-2b038698">The storm has killed over a dozen people across five states.</h2><p>At least 18 deaths had been attributed to the storm system as of Sunday evening.

One had passed just 100 feet from her house, she said, but it wasn’t until the next day that realized just how close she had come to having a brush with disaster.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“I got home that night,” she recalled, “and you could see it took out both houses next to us — everything — it was that close.”</p><p>Tornadoes also touched down over the weekend elsewhere. One hit near Barton, Ala., late Saturday, and another, in Jasper County, Miss., killed one person.</p><p>The storm system has featured strong gusty winds, even in areas where no tornadoes formed. It knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of customers, though service was restored in most areas by the weekend.</p><p>The pace of tornado formation eased after Wednesday, but more tornadoes are possible in the coming days as the storm moves east, especially in parts of southeastern Georgia, northern Florida and southern South Carolina.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Nazaneen Ghaffar<!-- -->, <!-- -->Ali Watkins<!-- -->, <!-- -->Carly Gist<!-- -->, <!-- -->Isabelle Taft<!-- --> and <!-- -->Kevin Williams<!-- -->.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>April 7, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a city where evacuations were ordered.
