Trump’s decision to nominate Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, for attorney general, and several said they were skeptical that he would be able to secure enough votes for confirmation.</p><p>“He’s got his work really cut out for him,” Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, said, chuckling as she spoke.</p><p>Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, raised his eyebrows when reporters informed him of Mr. Trump’s choice.</p><p>“I’m still trying to absorb all this,” he said. Mr. Cornyn later told reporters: “I don’t really know him, other than his public persona.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Gaetz, who has been one of Mr. Trump’s fiercest attack dogs on Capitol Hill, has routinely used his position on the House Judiciary Committee to question the motives of Justice Department officials and rail against what he has called the “deep state.” He was also investigated by the Justice Department for child sex trafficking, though Mr. Gaetz was never charged with any crimes.</p><p>But Mr. Gaetz, who was just re-elected to a fifth term, remains under ethics investigation for his conduct, which includes allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use; sharing inappropriate images or videos on the House floor; misusing state identification records; converting campaign funds to personal use; and accepting impermissible gifts under House rules. Mr. Gaetz has denied the allegations as political payback and said they are built on lies.</p><p>“The lawful, consensual sexual activities of adults are not the business of Congress,” he wrote in a letter posted to social media in September.</p><p>Several members of the House called for the Ethics Committee to release the findings of their investigation into Mr. Gaetz immediately, since the probe would close should Mr. Gaetz resign to take the post.</p><p>The allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use are likely to play a central role in his confirmation process.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I was shocked by the announcement — that shows why the advise and consent process is so important,” said Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, who has sometimes clashed with Mr. Trump. “I’m sure that there will be a lot of questions raised at his hearing.”</p><p>“I don’t think he’s a serious candidate,” Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican who also has broken with Mr. Trump frequently, said of Mr. Gaetz.</p><p>Even some of Mr. Trump’s stalwart supporters declined to offer support.</p><p>Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, refused to speak specifically about Mr. Gaetz’s candidacy, repeating that he was looking forward to all of Mr. Trump’s nominees receiving confirmation hearings and getting the president-elect’s cabinet in place.</p><p>Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and a former chair of the Judiciary Committee, stood expressionless as reporters asked him if he had any concerns about Gaetz, refusing to answer.</p><p>Democrats seized on the nomination and the G.O.P.’s discomfort, arguing that their votes on Mr. Gaetz’s nomination would serve as a litmus test for whether Republicans would be willing to stand up to the president-elect to safeguard the institutions of federal government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The key question is whether they will have the backbone and respect for justice — it’s that simple,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said of Senate Republicans. “This nomination will probably be the first test of their integrity.”</p><p>Mr. Trump has called on Senate Republicans to allow him to circumvent the confirmation process by calling recesses during which he could install personnel without Senate approval. It was not clear whether Senator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican elected as majority leader on Wednesday, would be willing to do so for Mr. Gaetz, or other nominees who might struggle to draw enough support to be confirmed.</p><p>At least one Senate Republican indicated he viewed Gaetz’s nomination favorably.</p><p>“He’s smart — clever guy,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said of Mr. Gaetz, adding: “I usually support presidential picks to be in their cabinet. I’ve done that for both sides. That’s my disposition.”</p><p>Luke Broadwater<!-- -->, <!-- -->Carl Hulse<!-- -->, <!-- -->Maya C.
