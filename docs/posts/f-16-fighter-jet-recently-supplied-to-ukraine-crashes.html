While the United States and other allies have provided Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars of military equipment, the fighter jets have taken on outsized importance as a symbol of Western support.</p><p>The plane was lost after Ukraine scrambled its air defenses in an attempt to intercept more than 200 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/world/europe/russia-ukraine-missiles-kyiv.html" title="">missiles and drones</a> fired by Russia on Monday, in what President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said was one of the largest attacks of its kind since the war began 30 months ago.</p><p>The F-16s were involved in the effort and had “demonstrated their high efficiency,” shooting down four cruise missiles, Ukraine’s general staff said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua/posts/pfbid021zRYaFyVCw5dQ8WhKpDc7vMnpQP2k18FWkMqqt2ZGeYZ44B4zu4gBCkem8KTeyDTl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on Facebook</a>. But “communication was lost with one of the aircraft. It was later determined that the aircraft had crashed and the pilot was killed.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The military said that it had opened an investigation into the cause of the crash. A Western official said the Ukrainians were looking at pilot error or mechanical failure, rather than enemy fire. The crash was<em> </em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/ukrainian-f-16-is-destroyed-in-crash-4f6d66f6?mod=latest_headlines" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal.</a> </p><p>Ukraine’s military general staff did not disclose the identity of the pilot who was killed, but the air force said that it had lost a pilot named Oleksiy Mes on Monday during the assault on the country.</p><p>“Oleksiy saved Ukrainians from deadly Russian missiles. Unfortunately, at the cost of your own life,” the Air Force’s western command said in a post on Facebook.</p><p>A news website in the city of Lutsk in northwestern Ukraine, Volyn News, reported that a <a href="https://www.volynnews.com/news/all/ostanniy-biy-u-nebi-zahynuv-lotchyk-luchanyn-oleksiy-mes/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">large funeral</a> was held in the city on Thursday for the pilot. It posted photographs of the event and said that Ukrainian Air Force jets performed a fly over in honor of the pilot.</p><p>The arrival and deployment of the F-16’s has been a subplot in the war. From the earliest days of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, Mr. Zelensky had called on NATO to supply his country with military aid, arguing that Ukraine was fighting for all of Europe as well as Western values.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Each time President Biden and other leaders acceded to Kyiv’s requests, Ukrainian leaders expressed gratitude while also making new demands. The fighter jets, which can be used to attack Russian forces but are also valuable for their ability to shoot down incoming missiles, became the most high-profile item on Ukraine’s list.</p><p>When they finally arrived, Mr. Zelensky posted a <a href="https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/11283" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">triumphant video</a> on his social media page and was photographed sitting in one.</p><p>Yet military experts have cautioned that they were unlikely to make an immediate difference on the battlefield, even though they are versatile and equipped with advanced radar systems and a variety of weapons. Their primary value, the experts said, was as part of an arsenal with which Ukraine could defend itself in the coming years.</p><p>Ukrainian officials declined to say how many planes had been delivered in the initial batch, but European countries, which have promised 45 of the jets, were expected to deliver only six this summer.</p><p>Nastya Kuznietsova contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matthew-mpoke-bigg">More about Matthew Mpoke Bigg</a></span></p></div><div><p>Eric Schmitt is a national security correspondent for The Times, focusing on U.S. military affairs and counterterrorism issues overseas, topics he has reported on for more than three decades.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-schmitt">More about Eric Schmitt</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
