    <h1>Large Protests Call for Impeachment of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hours before South Korea’s National Assembly was expected to vote on impeaching President Yoon Suk Yeol on Saturday, the surrounding area was dense with protesters calling for the impeachment.</p><p>Demonstrations in the city and around the country have intensified since Mr. Yoon’s audacious, though short-lived, declaration of martial law on Tuesday plunged South Korea into political crisis. The Saturday rally at the National Assembly was poised to be the largest one yet, and it had a festival-like atmosphere as it kicked off. Many parents brought along their young children.</p><p>Big screens and sound systems were set up along the three-quarter mile stretch of road leading up to the National Assembly, broadcasting speakers and performers leading the crowd in chants and songs, many with lyrics calling for Mr. Yoon’s impeachment.</p><p>The crowds grew so large that Seoul’s subway operator closed three nearby stations, and people continued to flow in, moving through an area that police had closed off to traffic. People carried signs, as well as blankets to bundle up against the temperatures, which have hovered near freezing all week. Chants and music could be heard from blocks away.</p></div></div>
