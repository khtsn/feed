As the opposition tried to persuade them to return and support the ouster, voting dragged on. An organizer of the protest, one of South Korea’s largest labor unions, said in a statement that it was getting protesters to surround the National Assembly complex to bar lawmakers from leaving.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Wow,” said Lee Soo-jin, 35, when asked how she would feel if the impeachment motion failed. “Actually, I wasn’t thinking about that at all,” she added, holding a hand warmer. Ms. Lee said she would protest until Mr. Yoon was impeached.</p><p>There was a festive atmosphere as the rally kicked off in the afternoon. Many parents brought along their young children.</p><p>Lee Soo-young, 38, pushed her 2-year-old son in a stroller. “I don’t want him to live in a country that could be under martial law again,” she said.</p><p>Over the next few hours, the crowds swelled, even as night fell and the temperature dropped. Seoul’s subway operator closed three nearby stations, yet people continued to flow in, filling several blocks and intersections. Many people held candles or colorful light sticks. They carried blankets to bundle up against the temperatures, which have hovered near freezing all week. Chants and music could be heard from blocks away.</p><p>Organizers used Facebook to arrange cross-country transportation: shuttle buses from cities hours away from Seoul and even plane rides from Jeju, an island off the southern coast. On X, people shared names that protesters could give at nearby cafes to get free drinks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>While most of the attention was on the crowds outside the National Assembly, in another part of Seoul, a much smaller group of Mr. Yoon’s supporters gathered in one of the city’s main plazas. Mr. Yoon’s low approval rating plunged further this week. But thousands of his supporters sang anthems and waved South Korean and U.S. flags on Saturday.</p><p>Demonstrators there did not want to talk about the short-lived martial law. Instead, person after person criticized the leader of the main opposition party, Lee Jae-myung, calling him a communist, and said Mr. Yoon was protecting the country from communism and preserving its relationship with the United States.</p><p>While the crowd supporting Mr. Yoon was predominantly older, outside the National Assembly, many were protesting for the first time.</p><p>Among them was An Ye-young, 19, who said she was there against her parents’ wishes. “For many of us who don’t usually pay attention to politics, and have just turned old enough to vote, there’s been a wake-up call to become more aware,” she said.</p><p>The night martial law was imposed, Ms. An couldn’t sleep. She rewatched “A Taxi Driver,” the South Korean film about the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/asia/gwangju-massacre-human-acts-han-kang.html" title="">uprising against martial law in Gwangju</a> in May 1980. “When I saw the scenes where citizens raised their voices,” she said, “I thought I should go and protest.”</p><p>Qasim Nauman<!-- --> contributed reporting from Seoul.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-yoon">More about John Yoon</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
