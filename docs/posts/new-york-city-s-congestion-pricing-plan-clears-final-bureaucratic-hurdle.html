    <h1>New York City’s Congestion Pricing Plan Clears Final Bureaucratic Hurdle</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The plan, which has stalled for decades, has now completed its breakneck comeback. The final greenlight on Friday came from the Federal Highway Administration, according to officials with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</p><p>“This is an exciting moment,” said Janno Lieber, the chief executive of the authority, which will implement the plan. “Everybody knows this has been a long journey getting to this point.”</p><p>The incoming administration of Donald J. Trump will likely not be as accommodating. The president-elect is opposed to the tolling plan, saying that the added cost of the tolls could keep tourists from Manhattan and hurt businesses. He has vowed to undo the plan as one of his first acts in office, though his options are limited now that the federal government has signed off.</p><p>Even with the lower rates, the program has been highly unpopular in the New York City area. At least nine lawsuits currently threaten the plan, and a group of opponents escalated their efforts last week by requesting an injunction to block it from advancing.</p><p><a href="https://scri.siena.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SNY-April-2024-Poll-Release-FINAL.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A Siena College survey conducted in April</a> revealed that about two-thirds of New York State residents said they opposed the program.</p></div></div>
