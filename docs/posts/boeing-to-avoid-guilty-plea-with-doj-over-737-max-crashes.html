Biden Jr. to plead guilty to a felony charge. The judge overseeing the case asked the parties to revise the deal in December. Boeing’s admission that it obstructed the F.A.A. would not constitute a guilty plea under the new deal.</p><p>“Ultimately, in applying the facts, the law, and department policy, we are confident that this resolution is the most just outcome with practical benefits,” the Justice Department said in a statement. “Nothing will diminish the victims’ losses, but this resolution holds Boeing financially accountable, provides finality and compensation for the families and makes an impact for the safety of future air travelers.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Justice Department floated the possibility of such a deal in a call with the families of victims of the crashes last week, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/business/boeing-737-max-crashes-guilty-plea.html" title="">their lawyers dismissed it as a miscarriage of justice</a>.</p><p>“This kind of non-prosecution deal is unprecedented and obviously wrong for the deadliest corporate crime in U.S. history,” Paul Cassell, a lawyer representing many of the families, said in a statement on Friday. “My families will object and hope to convince the court to reject it.”</p><p>Under the deal, Boeing would be required to invest about $455 million in quality and safety programs, and pay about $445 million into a compensation fund for beneficiaries of the 346 people who died in the pair of crashes. The company would also be fined $487 million, half of which it will receive credit for after an earlier fine payment.</p><p>A legal filing describing the deal in general terms did not include details about how the investments would be carried out. Boeing has already made investments in safety and quality programs since a panel blew off one of its planes mid-flight in January 2024, raising concerns about the quality of its planes.</p><p>Boeing would also agree to retain a “compliance consultant” who would issue recommendations to the company and report findings to the government. Companies are sometimes required to be overseen by federal monitors, for which there is a history of legal precedent, but Mr. Cassell raised questions about what powers a consultant would have.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The company’s board would also be required to meet with the families of the victims.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Niraj Chokshi writes about aviation, rail and other transportation industries.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
