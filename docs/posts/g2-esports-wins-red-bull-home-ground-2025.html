</span>. </p>

<p>As the upper bracket finalists, NRG leveraged their double map ban to take away Bind and Sunset, leaving Corrode, Split, Pearl, Abyss, and Haven as the pool for the series. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/585453/nrg-vs-g2-esports-red-bull-home-ground-2025-gf/?game=241511&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Corrode</a> was a map that NRG were undefeated on since its release, with nine consecutive wins. The reigning world champions initially seemed primed to keep the streak going, opening with an 8-1 lead and forcing G2 to burn both of their timeouts in the first nine rounds. </p>

<p>Not a squad to back down easily, G2 mounted a comeback, stabilizing to an 8-4 half and winning the bonus off the back of a 3K from <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/2170/babybay">
		BABYBAY	</a>
</span> to draw even at 8-8. </p>

 
<p><em>BABYBAY pushes forward and makes the bonus-winning play.</em></p>

<p>The next few rounds were back-and-forth, many of them ending with only one player left standing. The pivotal round came in at 10-10; G2 read NRG&#39;s B rush to win a flawless eco, spurring them on to win 13-10 and hand NRG their first-ever loss on Corrode.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/585453/nrg-vs-g2-esports-red-bull-home-ground-2025-gf/?game=241512&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Split</a>, which NRG hadn&#39;t shown since its recent return to the map pool, was under G2&#39;s control all the way through as they converted the first bonus to take a 7-2 lead. NRG brought the half back to 8-4 to keep their hopes alive, but G2 quickly squashed them with a second bonus to close out 13-4. <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/3993/jawgemo">
		jawgemo	</a>
</span> put on a clinic on Waylay, ending the map with a 1.92 rating, 343 ACS, and a 24/9/5 KDA. </p>


<p><em>jawgemo collects four in the pistol round with his trusty Frenzy.</em></p>

<p>The final map was <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/585453/nrg-vs-g2-esports-red-bull-home-ground-2025-gf/?game=241513&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Pearl</a>. G2 continued to dominate the pistol record to take a 5-1 lead, but NRG fought back, collecting three rounds in a row to get the score back 5-4. G2 grabbed a couple more rounds by running down the clock, ultimately securing a narrow 7-5 lead at halftime. </p>

<p>G2 picked up yet another pistol round to kick off the second half, taking five out of six pistols over the course of the series and keeping the pressure on NRG. The final nail in the coffin, however, was round 17, where <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/7873/leaf">
		leaf	</a>
</span> and jawgemo won a 2v4 that included leaf getting a knife kill on <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/2172/brawk">
		brawk	</a>
</span> through <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/11118/skuba">
		skuba	</a>
</span>&#39;s Cosmic Divide.</p>


<p><em>leaf nails the knife kill through the Cosmic Divide to win an impossible 2v4 alongside jawgemo.</em></p>

<p>A 10-7 lead gave way to 13-7 as G2 closed out the series and claimed the Red Bull Home Ground 2025 trophy. leaf was the best performer on Pearl with 19 kills and a 164 ADR, while <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/15500/trent">
		trent	</a>
</span> and jawgemo led the series with respective ratings of 1.35 and 1.29. </p>

<p>The post-match interview for G2 was one filled with determination for the season that lies ahead. “It&#39;s not anything that we want to finish on,” <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/3885/valyn">
		valyn	</a>
</span> said. “We have bigger aspirations than the offseason trophies.”</p>

<p>When asked about his return to competing with G2 as a starter, BABYBAY pointed to his teammates as a source of gratitude and motivation. “I just think it&#39;s something special when somebody believes in you like that, and it makes me not want to let them down at all, you know, so I&#39;m doing it for them.” He continued, “I&#39;ve already had a long career in this game, but if we can win some international trophies, it&#39;s gonna be amazing, and it all starts right here at Red Bull Home Ground.”</p>
