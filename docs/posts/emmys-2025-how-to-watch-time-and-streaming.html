This is the 77th edition of the Emmys.</p><p>Here’s how to watch:</p><h2 id="link-1a030ceb">What time does the show start?</h2><p>The ceremony begins at 8 p.m. Eastern (5 p.m. Pacific) and will be held at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles. The Emmys usually finish on schedule, in about three hours.</p><h2 id="link-3b3fe01a">Where can I watch?</h2><p>CBS is broadcasting the ceremony, making it easy to watch if you have access to network television. You can stream the Emmys live on Paramount+ if you have the “premium plan,” which costs $13 a month (free trials and <a href="https://www.paramountplus.com/?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;ds_rl=1289065&amp;ftag=PPM-02-10aeg8j&amp;vndid=google$null$null$paramount%20plus%20sports&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=11139459726&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADtO7xGdHGhvYrGQQF-ZTj4RbL_8z&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwoP_FBhDFARIsANPG24NiLAXqK6NWlDhayydEW_PD_9K5NpdmB_cK46H1UjDOWg84yhFYMh4aAmqdEALw_wcB" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discounts</a> are also available). The Emmys will not be available to stream live on the cheaper Paramount+ “essential plan.”</p><p>There are also plenty of streaming services that carry CBS, including YouTube TV and Hulu Live, but you will need a subscription to those distributors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-2326bcf1">What’s eligible?</h2><p>Shows that had their premier from June 2024 to May 2025.</p><p>Twenty-five awards will be handed out during the ceremony, including acting and writing honors, as well as best drama, comedy, limited and talk series. Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen will also get a special shout-out on Sunday when they are presented the Bob Hope Humanitarian Award</p><p>Last weekend, dozens of technical and guest acting statuettes were already awarded at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards. “The Studio” (9) and “The Penguin” (8) lead all series with the most Emmy wins so far.</p><h2 id="link-73261f6e">Who’s hosting?</h2><p>The comedian Nate Bargatze will lead the proceedings. Bargatze is a comedian <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/arts/television/nate-bargatze-christmas-special-comedy.html" title="">on a rapid rise</a> and who tends to keep it clean and G-rated; he is unlikely to touch any political third rails. The head of CBS recently told The Hollywood Reporter that <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/nate-bargatze-interview-emmys-2025-comedy-theme-park-1236366090/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=exacttarget&amp;utm_campaign=Today+In+Entertainment+September+10+2025&amp;utm_content=632654_9-10-2025&amp;utm_id=632654" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he admired</a> how Bargatze is “just trying to bring us all together.” Bargatze has hosted “Saturday Night Live” twice, both times to <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/saturday-night-live-recap-nate-bargatze-season-50-episode-2.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rave reviews</a>.</p><p>CBS tapped Bargatze for the job in April, an earlier-than-usual announcement. That also meant the network decided not to go with its far more politically oriented late-night host, Stephen Colbert, who hosted the event for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/arts/television/emmys-best-worst-highlights.html" title="">network in 2017</a>. Over the summer, CBS announced that Colbert’s late-night show <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/17/business/stephen-colbert-late-show-ending.html" title="">had been canceled</a> and will go off the air in May 2026.</p><h2 id="link-2239593a">When is the red carpet?</h2><p>The cable network E! will air a red carpet show that begins at 6 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>CBS has a red carpet show of its own; it begins at 7 p.m. Eastern and will be led by the “Entertainment Tonight” hosts Kevin Frazier and Nischelle Turner. It will also be available to stream on the Paramount+ premium plan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-359510fe">Who are some of the favorites?</h2><p>The Apple TV+ dystopian workplace series “Severance” and the HBO Max medical show “The Pitt” are in a showdown for best drama. Though award forecasters believe “Severance” remains the narrow favorite, industry insiders think the race is too close to call. Best actor in a drama remains competitive, too, with Noah Wyle (“The Pitt”) vying to win his first Emmy, with Adam Scott (“Severance”) also very much in the mix.</p><p>“The Studio,” the Apple TV+ sendup of modern Hollywood, is the heavy favorite in the comedy categories, and already collected nine Creative Arts Emmys last weekend. It will face off against last year’s winner, “Hacks.”</p><p>Netflix’s “Adolescence” is the favorite in the limited series categories, though the HBO Max series “The Penguin” collected eight Emmys last weekend, the second most of any series thus far.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Koblin covers the television industry for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
