    <h1>Will a Time Magazine Cover Drive a Wedge Between Trump and Musk?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The president did not look amused. He was meeting the Japanese prime minister for the first time on Friday when a reporter shouted out to ask if he had a “reaction” to the new cover of Time magazine. The cover, the reporter told Mr. Trump, depicts “Elon Musk sitting behind <em>your </em>Resolute Desk.”</p><p>“No,” Mr. Trump answered pointedly. He looked down at the floor. The next few seconds stretched like an eternity as a translator related the exchange to the prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, in Japanese.</p><p>Just in case any of the sauciness of the moment had been lost in translation, Mr. Trump waited until the interpreter had finished and then cracked: “Is Time magazine still in business? I didn’t even know that.” Everyone around him laughed gamely, if a bit nervously.</p><p>It is unlikely that Mr. Trump didn’t know whether Time magazine was still in business. His own face had, after all, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/style/donald-trump-time-stock-exchange.html" title="">stared out from its cover</a> only two months ago, when the magazine anointed him its “Person of the Year.” As part of the rollout of that issue, Mr. Trump rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange in front of a blown-up version of the cover.</p></div></div>
