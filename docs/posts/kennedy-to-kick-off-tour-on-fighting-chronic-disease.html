    <h1>Kennedy to Kick Off Tour on Fighting Chronic Disease</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During his first months in office, Mr. Kennedy’s policies have been unfurled with great brouhaha, but the secretary himself has been relatively low profile, particularly for an official with his degree of fame. The White House has encouraged Mr. Kennedy to take a more public-facing approach to his role, but the timing of his first major push out in the country will require toeing a careful line around the most conspicuous issue on the table.</p><p>Public health experts say the measles outbreak that has now infected nearly 500 people in West Texas is driven by low vaccination rates. Mr. Kennedy, who is famously skeptical of vaccine safety, shifted his rhetoric after the little girl’s funeral, <a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1908967854394982414?s=46&amp;t=CXMzot_Mnt2cwoVN3IVm7w" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posting on X</a>: “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”</p><p>It was the most definitive statement he has made endorsing vaccines as a preventive tool, but some public health experts were dismayed that he did not explicitly recommend that parents vaccinate their children and did not say the vaccines were safe. And several hours later <a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he posted on X again</a>, praising two doctors who are using unproven treatments to care for hundreds of children with measles.</p><p>For months, Mr. Kennedy has emphasized that vaccination was a matter of parental choice and encouraged people to consider unproven regimens like vitamin A, which can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html#:~:text=At%20high%20doses%2C%20vitamin%20A,rare%20instances%2C%20seizures%20and%20coma." title="">lead to toxicity</a>, and suggested that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-texas-kennedy-fox.html" title="">poor lifestyle choices</a> were at play among victims.</p><p>Diet and nutrition “don’t offer any benefit to prevent infection with measles whatsoever,” said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist and immunologist who has studied measles.</p></div></div>
