Andrew M. Cuomo announced on Saturday that he would run for mayor of New York City, upending the race to unseat Eric Adams and setting up an audacious comeback attempt three years after he resigned in disgrace.</p><p>With near-universal name recognition, deep-pocketed supporters and a decade as governor, Mr. Cuomo is expected to quickly assume front-runner status for the June Democratic primary, albeit with hefty baggage.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPMZCi1UylE&amp;t=1026s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 17-minute video</a> announcing his run, Mr. Cuomo, 67, attempted to reintroduce himself to New Yorkers on his preferred terms: as a tested manager, law-and-order moderate and forceful leader capable of rescuing a city that he said “feels threatening, out of control, and in crisis.”</p><p>He blamed “failed Democratic leadership” but did not explicitly mention Mr. Adams, and said he would try to work with President Trump where he could.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Today, it is necessary to launch a bold action plan to turn New York City around to save our city,” Mr. Cuomo said.</p><p>But his candidacy is also poised to push to the fore other, potentially divisive questions about the staying power of the #MeToo movement and the direction of the Democratic Party at a time when Mr. Trump is asserting power well beyond Washington.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo has spent years and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-legal-fees-ny-taxpayers.html" title="">millions of taxpayer dollars for legal fees</a> fighting to clear his name after 11 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/nyregion/letitia-james-ag.html" title="">sexual harassment accusations</a> prompted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-resigns.html" title="">his resignation</a> in August 2021. To win, he will have to convince New Yorkers that he is innocent — or at least to look beyond his transgressions and a field of newer talent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protests focusing on Mr. Cuomo’s treatment of women, like this one in 2021, may be rekindled as his campaign starts in earnest.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Justin Lane/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Cuomo did not directly address the claims against him on Saturday, but suggested they had changed him.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Did I make mistakes, some painfully? Definitely, and I believe I learned from them and that I am a better person for it and I hope to show that every day,” Mr. Cuomo says in the video.</p><p>“But I promise you this: I know what needs to be done and I know how to do it, and I will give it my all to get the job done — and it will get done.”</p><p>It took just moments after Mr. Cuomo announced his campaign for his Democratic rivals to begin denigrating him as a relic best left in the past. They are prepared to relitigate his treatment of women, his stewardship of the state and even his commitment to New York City, where he had not lived full time for decades until recently.</p><p>“Andrew Cuomo is for himself and only himself, and is hoping New Yorkers will forget his disastrous record for our city of endless scandals, destroying the subway, and cutting basic services,” Brad Lander, the left-leaning city comptroller running for mayor, said.</p><p>Saturday’s announcement ended <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-mayor.html" title="">months of speculation</a> about Mr. Cuomo’s future and touched off an urgent new phase in the race.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>New York City is facing skyrocketing housing costs, unease about public safety and an unfolding leadership crisis that began with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/nyregion/eric-adams-charges.html" title="">federal corruption charges</a> against Mr. Adams in the fall and accelerated this winter amid accusations that he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/nyregion/danielle-sassoon-quit-eric-adams.html" title="">struck a corrupt deal</a> with the Trump administration to drop them.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo joins <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/nyregion/nyc-mayor-candidates-2025.html" title="">a crowded field</a> that includes talented young upstarts, seasoned Democratic officeholders and an embattled incumbent. At least two other prominent officials, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/nyregion/adrienne-adams-mayor-nyc.html" title="">City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams</a> and Jessica Tisch, the police commissioner, are being pushed to enter the race.</p><p>Public polling before Mr. Cuomo’s entrance consistently found him in the lead, followed by Mr. Lander; Scott M. Stringer, the former comptroller; Mr. Adams and others, including State Senator Zellnor Myrie and Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-9"><div data-testid="interactive-block"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/nyregion/nyc-mayor-candidates-2025.html"><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/10/multimedia/2025-01-28-nyc-mayor-tracker-index/2025-01-28-nyc-mayor-tracker-index-articleLarge-v3.jpg"/></p><div><h2>Who’s Running for Mayor of New York City?</h2><p>The Democratic incumbent, Eric Adams, faces an unusually large field of challengers seeking to seize on his low poll numbers and legal problems.</p></div></a></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>For Mr. Cuomo, the contest may provide the best — and possibly last — chance to rewrite the story of a Democratic dynasty, one that he once hoped would end in the White House, not the political wilderness. If elected, Mr. Cuomo would enter office as the oldest first-term New York City mayor in centuries.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>He waited for weeks, even as his opponents jockeyed for support, to enter the contest, to be sure he saw a clear path to City Hall and limit the time opponents have to dredge up his past.</p><p>But on Saturday, he began moving quickly, stopping by the influential union that represents doormen and building workers to compete for its endorsement before heading to the Bronx to talk with voters. He was expected to rally on Sunday with members of a carpenters’ union.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo has some clear advantages. His allies launched <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/nyregion/cuomo-super-pac.html" title="">a super PAC on Wednesday aiming to raise $15 million</a>, more than enough to dwarf his opponents. Mr. Cuomo, who is white, has deep ties to the city’s Black leadership and powerful real estate industry. And he can cite his success as governor legalizing same-sex marriage, rebuilding LaGuardia Airport and leading the state through the Covid crisis.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Cuomo won broad recognition for his leadership during the Covid pandemic, although the Covid deaths of nursing home patients have tainted his reputation.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Seth Wenig</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>He appears to be betting that the political and cultural climate has shifted to his advantage. Democrats have been drifting slowly back toward the ideological center, where Mr. Cuomo has long been at home. He indicated he was ready to pick fights with Democrats running to his left over policing, homelessness and support for Israel.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“New York City is in trouble,” Mr. Cuomo said. “You see it in the empty storefronts, the graffiti, the grime, the migrant influx, the random violence — the city just feels threatening, out of control and in crisis.”</p><p>Many of his supporters believe that the very qualities that contributed to his downfall as governor — his ruthless, domineering style — may now be positive attributes as Democrats search for someone who can go toe-to-toe with Mr. Trump.</p><p>“We don’t need a Mr. Nice Guy,” said Representative Ritchie Torres, an Afro-Latino Democrat from the Bronx supporting Mr. Cuomo. “We need a Mr. Tough Guy.”</p><p>But the history of New York City politics is also littered with early front-runners whose polling leads collapsed by Election Day. Mr. Cuomo knows the risks better than most: He got his political start working on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/05/nyregion/for-mario-cuomo-defeat-in-1977-mayors-race-cast-a-long-shadow.html" title="">his father’s 1977 race for mayor</a>, when the early promise of a Mario M. Cuomo mayoralty crashed into defeat.</p><p>This time, the younger Mr. Cuomo must navigate a path filled with obstacles and enemies accrued in large numbers. The race is arguably his first truly competitive one in decades, and the first time Mr. Cuomo has run under the city’s relatively new ranked-choice voting rules.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Some of the state’s most powerful political forces — including Gov. Kathy Hochul, The New York Post and Letitia James, the New York attorney general whose office investigated the sexual harassment accusations against Mr. Cuomo — have spent months trying to field another moderate candidate with the stature to block his return.</p><p>Among the options are Ms. Adams, the first Black Council speaker, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/nyregion/adrienne-adams-mayor-nyc.html" title="">formed a campaign committee</a> and indicated she would make a final decision next week. <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/22/opinion/new-yorkers-deserve-a-competent-choice-for-mayor-jessica-tisch-should-run/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Post favors Ms. Tisch</a>, a well-respected bureaucrat who is white and could afford to pump money from her family fortune into the race. She has taken no evident steps to run, though.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The New York City Council speaker, Adrienne Adams, recently formed a campaign committee to explore a run for mayor.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor J.

While few political strategists believe he could actually win a second term, the pugilistic mayor has shown he is willing to argue that Mr. Cuomo is trying to unseat the city’s second Black mayor.</p><p>Mr. Adams has attacked Mr. Cuomo for enacting changes to the state’s bail laws that Republicans and some Democrats say led to a rise in crime. He did not immediately comment on Mr. Cuomo’s entrance into the race.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Other opponents say Mr. Cuomo is to blame for some of the very things he says he wants to fix, including the state of the city’s subways.</p><p>Mr. Mamdani, who has momentum in the left wing of the party, <a href="https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1895892488369672237" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released a video</a> where he stood in front of Trump Tower and compared Mr. Cuomo to Mr. Trump.</p><p>“Time and time again, Andrew Cuomo has put billionaires and book deals before you, and he’s waited this long to announce his run for mayor to avoid answering why,” Mr. Mamdani said, referencing an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/14/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-book.html" title="">investigation into Mr. Cuomo’s $5 million book deal during the pandemic</a>.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo has had success chipping away at the credibility of some of the harassment claims. Last year, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-justice-department-harassment.html" title="">Justice Department reached a civil rights settlement</a> with the state concluding that he and his executive staff subjected at least 13 female employees to a “sexually hostile work environment.” (Mr. Cuomo was not a party to the settlement and disparaged its findings as a rehash of old information.)</p><p>He could also face ongoing legal jeopardy from Washington, where the Justice Department under Mr. Trump has already shown itself willing to use the law to influence New York City’s mayor.</p><p>Last fall, a House Republican chairman referred Mr. Cuomo for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/nyregion/cuomo-crime-covid-hearing.html" title="">potential prosecution</a> after he accused him of lying about a report on nursing home deaths during the pandemic. Mr. Cuomo insists he did not lie, but rather failed to remember certain details that he later sought to correct.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicholas Fandos is a Times reporter covering New York politics and government.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-fandos">More about Nicholas Fandos</a></span></p></div><div><p>Emma G.
