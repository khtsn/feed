The regulations were designed to prevent intolerant environments that hinder learning. Dozens of schools have faced inquiries from the Education Department since 2023 over complaints of such violations, with many still pending. </p><p>After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent invasion of Gaza by Israeli forces, many students at U.C.L.A. said they heard antisemitic chants at pro-Palestinian events, including “no peace until they’re dead,” according to a report by the Education Department after an <a href="https://ocrcas.ed.gov/sites/default/files/ocr-letters-and-agreements/09222257-a.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">investigation</a>.

At UC Santa Barbara, the department said the school had been notified of antisemitic vandalism at a dorm room and signs at a student center targeting some Jewish students.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
