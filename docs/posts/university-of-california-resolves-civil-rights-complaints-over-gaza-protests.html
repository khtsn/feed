The regulations were designed to prevent intolerant environments that hinder learning. Dozens of schools have faced inquiries from the Education Department since 2023 over complaints of such violations, with many still pending. </p><p>After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent invasion of Gaza by Israeli forces, many students at U.C.L.A. said they heard antisemitic chants at pro-Palestinian events, including “no peace until they’re dead,” according to a report by the Education Department after an <a href="https://ocrcas.ed.gov/sites/default/files/ocr-letters-and-agreements/09222257-a.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">investigation</a>. The department also said that pro-Palestinian students complained that they had been harassed by other students and members of the public.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In April, at a pro-Palestinian encampment on the U.C.L.A. campus, some Jewish students said they were denied access to occupied areas and campus buildings by pro-Palestinian protesters unless they renounced Zionism, and many Palestinian, Arab and pro-Palestinian students said they were attacked by counterprotesters, the department said.</p><p>Similar environments hostile to Jewish, Arab and Muslim students were reported at University of California campuses at Davis, San Diego, Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz, the department said. At UC Santa Barbara, the department said the school had been notified of antisemitic vandalism at a dorm room and signs at a student center targeting some Jewish students.</p><p>To resolve the complaints, the University of California agreed to measures that include more thoroughly investigating the reports of discrimination and harassment to determine if additional action is needed; providing more training to university authorities about their responsibilities to comply with federal law prohibiting discrimination; and obtaining approval from the department for any revisions to university policies regarding discrimination involving race, color or nationality.</p><p>In a statement after the Education Department’s announcement, the University of California said it “unequivocally rejects antisemitism, Islamophobia, and all forms of harassment and discrimination.” It added that it had taken more steps to support students and others, including creating a systemwide office of civil rights.</p><p>The wave of protests at college campuses following Oct. 7 resulted in a litany of legal action against universities and the ouster of some of their leaders, who were accused of failing to protect students from discrimination.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Some institutions, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/nyregion/nyu-antisemitism-settlement.html" title="">such as New York University</a>, agreed to make payments in addition to reviewing policies to settle legal claims.</p><p>U.C.L.A. was among the most active protest sites in the country. In April, U.C.L.A. administrators initially took a relatively tolerant approach to a pro-Palestinian encampment at the school. But after several days, the university’s chancellor, Gene Block, declared the encampment illegal and told demonstrators to leave. On April 30, agitators who were said to identify as Zionist attacked the encampment.</p><p>A university report found that the pro-Palestinian students inside the encampment were attacked with “bear mace and other chemical irritants, hammers, knives, stink bombs, high-grade fireworks, baseball bats, metal and wooden rods.”</p><p>One counterprotester reportedly had a gun, and protesters said they had pleaded with campus security to intervene. They said the attackers had been allowed to leave without being apprehended when law enforcement stepped in hours later, according to university reports.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers at an encampment at U.C.L.A. on May 2. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>On May 2, police officers raided and cleared the encampment, arresting more than 200 protesters.</p></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Orlando Mayorquín is a breaking news reporter, based in New York, and a member of the 2023-24 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship class</a>, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/orlando-mayorquin">More about Orlando Mayorquín</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">The Israel Hamas War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/education-department-us">Education Department (US)</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Across the U.S. With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters are exploring how America defines itself.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Alienation of Jaime Cachua: </strong>His friends and family members in Rome, Ga., voted to support mass deportation. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/us/trump-immigrant-deportations-rome-georgia.html">Now he’s scrambling to stay in the country</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brawls Fueled by Cellphones: </strong>Cafeteria melees.
