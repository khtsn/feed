protest the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and former Columbia University student.</p><p>President Trump has heralded the arrest as his administration moves to deport Mr. Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States who was a prominent figure in pro-Palestinian demonstrations on Columbia’s campus.</p><p>The protesters held aloft cloth banners printed in red and black lettering. One read, “Free Mahmoud Free Palestine.” They chanted, their words reverberating against the coral marble tiling. “Fight Nazis, not students,” they repeated.</p><p>Ninety-eight of the protesters were later arrested, according to John Chell, the Police Department’s chief of department.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Since news of Mr. Khalil’s arrest on Saturday became public, New Yorkers have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/nyregion/mahmoud-khalil-protest-white-house.html" title="">taken to the streets</a>, marching in Lower Manhattan and gathering on Columbia’s campus uptown. Free speech advocates and immigrant rights groups have questioned the legality of arresting Mr. Khalil, 30, who has a green card, was born and raised in Syria and is married to an American citizen. His lawyers are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/nyregion/mahmoud-khalil-detention-hearing.html" title="">challenging his arrest in court</a>.</p><p>Shortly before noon on Thursday, hundreds of people who had slowly been streaming into the lower level plaza of Trump Tower, President Trump’s high-rise in Midtown Manhattan, took off their coats and revealed bright red T-shirts that said “Not in Our Name” on the front and “Jews Say Stop Arming Israel” on the back.</p><p>In 2015, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/us/politics/donald-trump-runs-for-president-this-time-for-real-he-says.html" title="">launched his first winning presidential campaign</a> from a lectern in the very same building, after descending the golden escalator into the lobby. One of the protesters, Josh Dubnau, said the symbolism was intentional.</p><p>“He came down that escalator and immediately started demonizing immigrants,” said Mr. Dubnau, 59, a professor at Stony Brook University. “And so this is a symbolic spot where we’re here to say ‘no more.’ We won’t tolerate that.”</p><p>Building security officers turned up the music in the lobby and stopped more people from joining the group. After about 15 minutes, police officers who had been watching from afar warned that protesters who remained on the premises would be subject to arrest. Some began to slowly stream out; others stayed seated and continued to chant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Roughly an hour after the protest started, more than two dozen officers began detaining protesters, zip-tying their hands behind their backs, lifting them to their feet and carrying them up the escalator.</p><p>Below, protesters continued chanting.</p><p>“We will not comply,” they said. “Mahmoud, we are by your side.”</p><p>One protester, Jane Hirschmann, 78, said she was “feeling strong.” She is the descendant of Holocaust survivors, and she said Mr. Khalil’s arrest reminded her of family stories from that time, when her grandfather and uncle were taken away in the middle of the night.</p><p>“We have to stand up, and Jews, particularly, have to stand up because they’ve weaponized antisemitism,” Ms. Hirschmann said.</p><p>Moments later, she was arrested.</p><p>Plans for the event came together in 36 hours, said Sonya Meyerson-Knox, a spokeswoman for Jewish Voice for Peace.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“As Jews, we know our history,” she said. “We know what happens when authoritarian regimes start scapegoating people and start taking away rights; we know exactly where that leads.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alyce McFadden is a reporter covering New York City and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alyce-mcfadden">More about Alyce McFadden</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/jewish-voice-for-peace-inc">Jewish Voice for Peace Inc</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
