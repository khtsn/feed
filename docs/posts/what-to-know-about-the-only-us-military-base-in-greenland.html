It’s irreplaceable.”</p><p>The outpost is getting new attention as President Trump, who has vowed to make Greenland part of the United States, sends <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/us/politics/usha-vance-trump-us-greenland.html" title="">a high-level delegation</a> to the island this week. The visitors will include Vice President JD Vance, who said on Tuesday that he intended to visit “our guardians” in the Space Force while there.</p><p>About 150 U.S. Air Force and Space Force personnel are permanently stationed at Pituffik (pronounced Bee-doo-FEEK). They handle missile defense and space surveillance, and the <a href="https://www.spaceforce.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Article/2197738/upgraded-early-warning-radars/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Upgraded Early Warning Radar</a> based here can detect ballistic missiles in their earliest moments of flight.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Each summer, about 70 members of the New York Air National Guard fly into Pituffik to support science missions. Using the U.S. military’s only ski-equipped aircraft, the LC-130, they deliver researchers and supplies to camps on the ice sheet.</p><p>Pituffik is the only U.S. military base on Greenland.</p><h2 id="link-6ee3b0f7">The history</h2><p>The American military presence in Greenland began during World War II, when Greenland was a Danish colony. After Nazi Germany occupied Denmark in 1940, Greenland was suddenly isolated and undefended. The United States struck a quiet deal with Denmark’s ambassador in Washington — bypassing the German-controlled government in Copenhagen — for American troops to build airfields and weather stations on the island.</p><p>By 1941, U.S. forces had landed, setting up defenses and scanning the North Atlantic for German submarines. A decade later, Denmark and the United States formalized the arrangement with a defense treaty granting Washington broad rights to operate military facilities on the island. Greenland is now a semiautonomous part of Denmark, which, like the United States, is a NATO country.</p><p>During the Cold War, Thule became a key Arctic outpost. From here, long-range American bombers could reach the Soviet Union, and massive radar systems were built to detect missiles crossing the polar route — the shortest path between the two superpowers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pituffik Space Base is one of the most strategically important military sites in the world.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ritzau Scanpix/via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>One of the era’s strangest experiments was Camp Century, a nuclear-powered base built under the ice in the late 1950s as part of a secret project called Iceworm. The plan was to test whether nuclear missiles could be hidden and launched from beneath the surface.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It was Cold War ambition at its wildest,” Mr. Rasmussen said. “They built a nuclear-powered base in one of the most hostile environments on Earth just to see if it could be done.”</p><p>The ice proved too unstable, and the base was abandoned. But the waste — including radioactive material and diesel — is still buried and scientists warn that warming temperatures could eventually expose it.</p><p>The base also left a lasting mark on Greenland’s Indigenous population. In 1953, about 130 Inuit were forcibly relocated from their homes near Thule to a harsher settlement farther north, poorly suited for traditional hunting. Compensation came decades later, but resentment remains.</p><p>The base’s name changed two year ago from Thule to Pituffik, which means in Greenlandic “the place we tie our dogs.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-2e255fb2">The location</h2><p>Pituffik sits above the 76th parallel on Greenland’s northwest coast, about 750 miles from the North Pole. It’s one of the most remote military installations on Earth.</p><p>The nearest settlement, Qaanaaq, is more than 70 miles away and home to fewer than 650 people. Many hunt seals, walrus and, occasionally, polar bears to survive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The base in 2019.

Despite the conditions, Pituffik’s airfield runs year-round. Ships can reach the base only during a narrow summer window when the sea ice temporarily retreats.</p><h2 id="link-6b2cc7b1">The base’s technology</h2><p>Pituffik is part of a global web of U.S. defense infrastructure and a crucial station. Military experts say that as new threats like hypersonic missiles emerge, the early-warning systems at Pituffik are indispensable.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“Hypersonic missiles don’t go into space — they fly low, they maneuver, and we have no way to intercept them once they’re launched,” explained Troy J. Bouffard, a retired U.S. Army officer and Arctic defense expert. “That makes early warning more important than ever — and that’s where Pituffik comes in.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pituffik is considered one of the most important stations in a global web of U.S. defense infrastructure.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ritzau Scanpix/via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>If a missile were launched from Russia or China toward North America, it would, Mr. Bouffard said, most likely pass over the Arctic.</p><p>Pituffik’s ground-based sensors are crucial in that case, said Mr. Bouffard, because satellites don’t work well in high latitudes.</p><p>Lasers don’t work in the Arctic, either, he added. “The air columns are full of ice crystals — basically tiny mirrors — and lasers and mirrors don’t get along,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Bouffard sees Pituffik’s role expanding beyond radar.</p><p>“It could also serve as a forward staging base or a key line of communication,” he said. “The more forward these locations are, the more useful they are.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jeffrey Gettleman is an international correspondent based in London covering global events.
