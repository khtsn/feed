She said the overall settlement totaled $7.4 billion, which would include $897 million from Purdue.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>New York could receive as much as $250 million, she said.</p><p>“The Sackler family relentlessly pursued profit at the expense of vulnerable patients and played a critical role in starting and fueling the opioid epidemic,” Ms. James said.</p><p>Echoing other settlements in nationwide opioid litigation, these payments are intended to fund efforts to prevent and treat addiction in hard-hit communities across the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Outside the Supreme Court in December 2023. In the plan rejected by the Supreme Court, the Sackler family demanded a guarantee that all current and future lawsuits against them related to Purdue and opioids would be barred.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Julia Nikhinson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We are extremely pleased that a new agreement has been reached that will deliver billions of dollars to compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver treatment and overdose rescue medicines that will save lives,” Purdue said in a statement, noting that a reorganization plan was still in the works.</p><p>The Sacklers did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>How many claimants will agree to the new terms is unclear. Ms. James noted that 14 other states involved in talks were on board: Florida, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Tennessee, California, Colorado, Illinois, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But the deal has to now be sold to all the claimants — not only the remaining states and thousands of local governments, but to hundreds of Native American tribes and some 140,000 personal injury victims.</p><p>Though many of those accepting the deal find the reserve fund for the Sacklers a difficult pill to swallow, the reality is that despite the long years of<span>  </span>the Purdue litigation, not a dollar has yet been sent to claimants, hurting from the immediate and ongoing harms of the opioid crisis. In recent months, there has been an urgency to getting a fresh deal done so the money can finally start flowing. Under the latest terms, those who object to the deal are at liberty to build new cases against the Sacklers. Under the former settlement, they were barred from doing so.</p><p>In fact the reserve legal fund for the Sacklers could be depleted swiftly: Already, lawsuits against the Sacklers have been threatened by a handful of states, counties, cities and individuals.</p><p>A spokesman for Washington State, which has successfully pursued other pharmaceutical companies rather than sign onto national deals, said the state was weighing its options.</p><p>The states, which are responsible for the bulk of the payments to the reserve fund, would have to keep a minimum of $200 million in the account, with total contributions capped at $800 million. After five years, unused funds would start reverting back to the states.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Final calculations for how much of the total Purdue deal would be deducted to pay lawyers, consultants and administration fees are still under discussion.</p><p>The Sacklers would pay nearly $3 billion in the first three years, with remaining payments over an additional 12 years.</p><p>If the plan is approved by claimants and confirmed by a federal bankruptcy judge, Purdue would emerge by the end of this year from the bankruptcy that has shielded it since 2019. It would immediately pay the $897 million of its own cash to the parties who signed on to the deal.</p><p>At that point, 15 years of Sackler payments would also commence. And most of the lawsuits that began more than a decade ago — eventually morphing into an ungainly combined litigation brought by cities, states, tribes, hospitals and individual victims, and argued by countless teams of lawyers — would, presumably, end.</p><p>In the plan rejected by the Supreme Court, the Sacklers, long portrayed across films, television and news articles as the public face of predatory opioid manufacturers, demanded a guarantee for putting up $6 billion: a prohibition against any current and future lawsuits against them related to Purdue and opioids.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Purdue itself gets that protection as a standard benefit conferred when a company comes out of bankruptcy. But because the Sacklers did not personally file for bankruptcy, the Supreme Court ruled in June that granting them permanent civil immunity was outside the purview of bankruptcy law.</p><p>The intention of the legal reserve fund, in which, essentially, claimants will be paying to defend the Sacklers against other claimants, is to satisfy the court’s ruling.</p><p>“If states are expected to contribute funds to the Sacklers’ legal defense, claimants and the public will want to hear more about the impact of that money going to the Sacklers and their lawyers rather than to opioid abatement,” said <a href="https://law.unc.edu/people/melissa-b-jacoby/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Melissa B.
