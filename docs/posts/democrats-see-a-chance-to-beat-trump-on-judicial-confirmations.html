It’s part of an effort to rebalance the federal courts after former President Donald J. Trump was able to name 234 mainly conservative judges to the federal bench.</p><p>But the results of the Nov. 5 election and the willingness of Democrats to dedicate themselves to confirming judges could determine how aggressive they will be in an effort that could require the Senate to spend weekends approving nominees over Republican opposition.</p><p>“That may mean some long sessions,” warned Senator Richard J. Durbin, the Illinois Democrat who leads the Judiciary Committee and has overseen the Democratic judicial drive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Even without a lame-duck push, Mr. Durbin and his fellow Democrats believe they have accomplished what Mr. Durbin described as a “political miracle” considering the Senate operated for two years under President Biden with a 50-50 margin and the final two years at 51-49 with prolonged absences by some.</p><p>“I didn’t think we’d ever get to these numbers but we were determined to do so,” Mr. Durbin said in an interview, noting that Senate Democrats had turned over 25 percent of the federal judiciary. “The White House was very cooperative, producing good nominees. And I just have to salute the committee. This is a tough assignment.”</p><p>In addition to the numbers, the nominees considered by the committee have been historically diverse given the traditional makeup of the federal judiciary and the longstanding practice of sending prosecutors to the federal bench. Of those confirmed so far, 64 percent have been women and 40 percent of them have been women of color, including Justice Katanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman named to the Supreme Court.</p><p>As for professional diversity, 40 of those confirmed had worked as public defenders, 14 as civil rights lawyers and eight as labor lawyers while 80 were prosecutors and 188 served as judges at some level.</p><p>“These judges are the most diverse group of nominees the bench has ever seen,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat and majority leader. “Nearly two-thirds are women, two-thirds are people of color, and we’ve confirmed more Hispanic, Asian and Native women and more L.G.B.T.Q. judges to the federal bench than under any other president’s full time in office.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The judicial success has come despite resistance from Senate Republicans, who have attacked some of the Democratic nominees as extreme and unqualified.</p><p>“I can assure our colleagues that Senate Republicans are no more inclined today than we were in July to rubber-stamp radicals for the federal bench,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, said earlier this month.</p><p>Despite calls by some progressive groups for Democrats to be even more aggressive, Mr. Durbin and some of his colleagues believe they made the right call in not ending a Senate tradition that gives home-state senators virtual veto power over nominees for federal district courts.</p><p>The decision did mean Democrats were unable to fill vacancies in states such as Mississippi and Missouri represented by Republicans who refused to back candidates put forward by the White House. But Democrats say retaining what is known as “blue slip” approval for home-state senators prevented a partisan meltdown in the Judiciary Committee that would have stalled other nominees.</p><p>Negotiations with Republicans did produce some breakthroughs. Thirty-one judges have been confirmed for the bench in states represented by two Republicans and 13 in states with one Republican senator.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I think we did the right thing,” Mr. Durbin said.</p><p>The question now is what happens when the Senate returns in November. With nearly 30 nominees in the pipeline awaiting floor and committee votes, Democrats have the opportunity to top the number of judges confirmed during the Trump years.</p><p>But winning approval of more than 20 judges would take considerable floor time and a concerted effort when lawmakers will be eager wrap up for the year. Some of those awaiting votes have also run into objections from Democrats. This week’s decision to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/us/politics/house-short-term-spending-bill.html" title="">punt a spending fight into December</a> could give Democrats more time to work with, but the Senate is not known these days for clocking long hours.</p><p>Should Democrats lose the Senate or the White House in the November vote, it could provide an incentive for them to force through as many judicial nominees as possible before power would exchange hands in January.</p><p>“We need to keep our foot on the accelerator all the way to the end,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Judiciary Committee. “I think we are all prepared to work really hard on judges and make it a priority. I would foresee that we may stay weekends in the lame duck.”</p><p>Republicans are skeptical that Senate Democrats will be that committed to a year-end judicial marathon with the end of the session looming. They expect that resolving the spending issues and a few other big-ticket legislative items will consume most of the congressional energy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I’ll believe it when I see it,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas and a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, about the prospect of weekend sessions. “I don’t see a lot of time for judges and I don’t see why we would make it easy for them.”</p><p>Despite the G.O.P. doubts, Mr. Durbin said he would like to better the Trump record. But he said that the prospect of falling a few judges short should not diminish what Democrats were able to accomplish in a difficult environment.</p><p>“It would be great to put that icing on the cake,” he said. “But we have turned a significant corner where we are and we are going to have more before it’s over.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Carl Hulse is the chief Washington correspondent, primarily writing about Congress and national political races and issues.
