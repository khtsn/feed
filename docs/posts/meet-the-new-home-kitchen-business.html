They’re open five days a week for takeout or dine-in.</p><p>It’s still a lot of work, but Ms. Ngo prefers it to traditional restaurant life. “In the morning, I sleep until I want to wake up, and we prep throughout the day,” she said.

Mr. McCoy is enrolled in culinary school as part of a career change, but neither has worked in restaurants before. They opened on Fridays and Saturdays and served whoever came by or called to put in an order.</p><p>A few would-be customers didn’t understand that, yes, this was a legally permitted restaurant where anyone could walk in and enjoy a meal. Confused callers asked why the Google listing showed a house. “We started out saying ‘home restaurant,’ and having to explain,” Ms. McCoy said. “We switched to saying ‘licensed facility.’”</p><p>But without a social media following, and no access to major delivery apps, business could be slow, and food costs added up. “Sitting there all day, hoping and waiting for someone to come through, and then they don’t, that’s hundreds of dollars you lost,” Ms. McCoy said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. McCoy learned to cook from his grandmother. “I would love to stand around and watch her cook,” he said. “She didn’t have a cookbook, she didn’t have recipes. She went off her feelings and her soul.”</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>To Mr. McCoy, there was one bright side: The unordered meals went toward feeding homeless neighbors, which was part of his mission in starting the business. “At one point in my life, I was homeless,” he said. “Having a wife who supports my dreams, and being able to cook the food the way I want in my home — yeah it’s a great feeling.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>But in late September, the couple decided to pause their MEHKO and regroup. While this first crack at the business did deplete their savings a bit, there was a bright side there too: The outdoor furniture they had bought came in handy for celebrating Mr. McCoy’s 50th birthday.</p><p>“I’m glad we learned about it this way, versus going into a restaurant,” Ms. McCoy said. “That would have been devastating.”</p><h2 id="link-7f99e60c">The future of the home restaurant industry</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-32"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>That sort of dynamism and experimentation is what the people behind the MEHKO program say it was intended to encourage.</p><p>“MEHKO is meant to be a steppingstone,” said Roya Bagheri, the executive director of the COOK Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy group that helped craft the program. Ms. Bagheri began her career as a pro bono lawyer for low-income entrepreneurs; many of her clients were immigrant women illegally selling food out of their homes.</p><p>She sees the MEHKO program as a way to bring people into the formal economy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>It once seemed possible the law might pave the way for a disruptive app like Uber or Airbnb, but for the home kitchen instead of the personal car or spare room. Akshay Prabhu, who became an advocate for home restaurants after his was shut down over a lack of a permit, built an app called Foodnome designed to connect new MEHKOs to curious diners. In the early days of the pandemic, business skyrocketed. But as the pandemic waned, both diners and cooks dropped off again.</p><p>“It’s not the gig-economy model, where you can clock in and clock out,” Mr. Prabhu said. “This is a lifetime battle that doesn’t operate at the speed of venture capital.”</p><p>This year, Mr. Prabhu handed Foodnome off to the <a href="https://www.cookalliance.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">COOK Alliance</a>. Rebranded as COOK Connect, the platform will become part of the nonprofit’s mission to train and support anyone who wants to start a MEHKO.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-37"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Now that the program has a track record of successes, it’s spreading across California, including to San Diego, Santa Barbara and Alameda Counties. The state law allowed each county to adopt MEHKO at its own discretion. But starting in November, the program will have its biggest chance at mainstream pickup in Los Angeles County — which Ms. Bagheri called MEHKO’s “white whale.”</p><p>Countless semi-underground restaurants are already run out of homes and backyards in Los Angeles County. The area’s density, not to mention its expense, might prompt a MEHKO boom. And a recent change to the MEHKO law may extend the program’s reach — home kitchens will be able to serve as commissaries for food carts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>Street vending has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/11/multimedia/la-street-vendors.html" title="">legal in Los Angeles County</a> since 2018, but the health department’s requirements for licenses for food carts are so strict that very few vendors have been able to obtain one. One major barrier was the requirement that all food be prepared in a commercial kitchen, an expense few people who sell tamales or hot dogs on the street can afford.</p><p>“MEHKO tries to create a pathway,” said Holly Mitchell, the Los Angeles County supervisor who led the program’s adoption in the county. “How do we help small and micro enterprise businesses transition into the permitting process? We had to look at what some of the barriers were.”</p><p>In Riverside County, MEHKO is still serving its primary purpose: a quick and low-cost means of learning the ropes. But it may be well-suited for a disconnected era when many lack the time to cook, especially in sprawling Southern California, where businesses and homes were intentionally kept apart.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-42"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“With the MEKHO system, people are using fresh food and actually cooking with their heart and their soul,” Mr. McCoy said. “That’s the direction we should start going in.”</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>The “micro” part of the micro-enterprises creates an intimacy hard to find even in a mom-and-pop restaurant. MEHKO owners described serving as five-minute therapists during pandemic pickups. Some said they kept their business going to feed a tight, dedicated crew of regulars who include their own neighbors.</p><p>Running a home restaurant brought Mr. McCoy back to his childhood in Miami. There, he said, it was common for a whole neighborhood to converge at the home of a local cook who was selling plates. But in Moreno Valley, he didn’t know his neighbors.</p><p>“For the short period of time we were running our MEHKO, we had neighbors that came over who I would know from seeing them, but they actually shared their stories with me, and told me about foods they liked,” Mr. McCoy said. “It’s more of an intimate feeling.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-44"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="kitchens-mehko" data-id="100000009782275" data-source-id="100000009782275"><header id="interactive-header"><h2 id="interactive-headline">Tell us about the kitchens in your neighborhood.</h2></header><div data-sourceid="100000009782275" id="embed-id-100000009782275">
