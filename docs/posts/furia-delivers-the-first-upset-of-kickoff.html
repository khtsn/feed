</span> took care of 100 Thieves in a 2-1.</p>



<p>The first match of the day pitted Sentinels against FURIA. Sentinels, even losing some of their biggest players, is always a team with high expectations. They showed promise in the off season, winning domestic events including the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2748/sentinels-invitational-2025" target="_blank">SEN Invitational</a> and the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2716/sen-city-classic-2025" target="_blank">SEN City Classic</a>. FURIA, on the other hand, has been a perennial bottom-tier team in Americas, and did not perform well in the off-season. They found their first win in almost a whole year in round one of Kickoff, but against KRÜ&#39;s full sub roster, it didn&#39;t instill much confidence. However, FURIA turned up to play today for the first big upset of Kickoff.</p>

<p>The match started on Sentinel&#39;s map of Split, where FURIA completely dominated. They won nine of the first ten rounds, with Sentinel&#39;s only round coming off the back of a <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/30470/kyu">
		Kyu	</a>
</span> 1v3. FURIA easily closed out their lead, ending the map with a 13-5 victory.</p>


<p><em><span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/796/eeiu">

</span> clutches out the 1v3.</em></p>

<p>The second map of Breeze was a much closer affair. Sentinels shook off their map one woes and started Breeze with a 4-0 lead. However, FURIA quickly bounced back and won six rounds in a row, taking a 7-5 lead at half.</p>

<p>The match heated up in the second half as the teams traded rounds. Big rounds from <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/1265/johnqt">
		johnqt	</a>
</span> and Kyu helped tie up the score at 10-10, but FURIA scored a thrifty one round later to once again take the advantage. From there, they closed out the map 13-11 to complete the upset in 2-0 fashion.</p>

<p>Sentinels is the first of the bye teams to fall down to the middle bracket, where they will face Evil Geniuses.</p>



<p>The second map of the day saw the reigning three-time Americas champion G2. Many questioned <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/2170/babybay">
		BABYBAY	</a>
</span>&#39;s inclusion on the roster, but he proved himself more than capable on map one of Bind. His prowess on Chamber allowed G2 to get up to an 8-4 lead on their attack half. In the second half however, 100 Thieves&#39; own Chamber player in <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4147/cryocells">
		Cryocells	</a>
</span> also came alive, and the map became a battle between the two players and their Operators. In the end, G2 was able to just edge out 100 Thieves for a narrow 13-11 win.</p>


<p><em>The smeag is back in action.</em></p>

<p>Map 2 of Corrode was a different story, where 100 Thieves mopped the floor with G2. With Cryo and <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/601/asuna">
		Asuna	</a>
</span> holding down sites on Veto and Sage, they racked up an 11-1 lead on the Defensive half. It wasn&#39;t long before they tied the series up with a 13-3 win.</p>

<p>This took the match to the final map, Split. G2 shook off any effects of map two, as they returned the favor right back to 100 Thieves. 10-2 was the score at half, with the thieves unable to close out any man advantages. Several 2v5s and 3v5s went the way of G2, including the second half pistol. </p>


<p><em>One singular <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7873/leaf">

</span>.</em></p>

<p>G2 soon got to match point off of a Classic 1v2 from <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/15500/trent">
		trent	</a>
</span>, with nine chances to close it out. It was only then did 100 Thieves start getting rounds, winning five in a row to instill some hope back in the team. However, in classic G2 fashion, they closed out the final round in a thrifty, only armed with Buckies and Stingers.</p>

<p>100 Thieves drop to the middle bracket to play against LOUD, while G2 moves on to face FURIA, now two matches away from <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2760/valorant-masters-santiago-2026" target="_blank">Santiago</a>.</p>

<p>Americas Kickoff will return next week with the first two rounds of the middle bracket.</p>
