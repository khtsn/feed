In recent years, Republicans in particular have changed both state laws and election rules to hamstring Democrats’ influence.</p><p>Now, one of the closest statewide elections in North Carolina history is offering a vivid example of the maneuvering in play to gain an upper hand.</p><p>A lengthy recount of more than 5.5 million ballots from the November election that ended last week showed that an incumbent Democrat on North Carolina’s state Supreme Court, Allison Riggs, held a 734-vote edge over Jefferson G. Griffin, a Republican judge on the state Court of Appeals.</p><p>Judge Griffin has not given up. He is protesting the results of the entire election to the State Board of Elections, arguing that many voters were ineligible to cast ballots. That has been tried before — unsuccessfully, by a Democratic chief justice of the state Supreme Court who lost an even closer race in 2020.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But the scope of Judge Griffin’s protest is far more ambitious: He is calling for some 60,000 voters to be disqualified.</p><p>The issue largely comes down to requirements in voter registration applications approved by Democratic legislators in a 2004 law. The form was supposed to require applicants to list their driver’s license or Social Security numbers, but it did not — and over the years, thousands of voters, unaware of the requirement, did not provide them.</p><p>Judge Griffin’s protest argues that voters whose registration forms have no numbers should not count in this election. Among those voters are Ms. Riggs’s parents.</p><p>Three Republican state legislators who also were edged out in local races have joined <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.ncsbe.gov/State_Board_Meeting_Docs/2024-12-11/Election%20Protests/Griffin-Adams-McGinn%20Brief%20For%20Protests%20w%20Appendix.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the judge’s protest</a>. </p><p>The complaint to the elections board includes more than 300 separate protests that were filed last month across all 100 North Carolina counties. The state Democratic Party has responded with <a href="https://dockets.justia.com/docket/north-carolina/ncedce/5:2024cv00699/214659" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a federal lawsuit</a> asking that the state elections board be barred from throwing out the ballots cited in Judge Griffin’s protest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In a <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.ncsbe.gov/State_Board_Meeting_Docs/2024-12-11/Election%20Protests/Riggs%20Brief%20Against%20Protests.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">response to the elections board</a> on Friday, lawyers for Ms. Riggs said the protest amounted to a ludicrous request for a do-over.</p><p>“Whether playing a board game, competing in a sport or running for office, the runner-up cannot snatch victory from the jaws of defeat by asking for a redo under a different set of rules,” they said. “Yet that is what Judge Griffin is trying to do here.”</p><p>North Carolina Republicans say Democrats are in a situation of their own making, having created a complex elections system with lax restrictions on voting and few efforts to ensure it works. And they bristle at the fact that Democrats hold majorities on state and county election boards, suggesting that the system is biased against them.</p><p>Republican lawmakers in the state are already working on a solution for that issue. They are expected to ratify legislation this month <a href="https://carolinapublicpress.org/67365/nc-senate-overrides-veto-of-bill-shifting-elections-board-appointment-power/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stripping the governor of the power</a> to appoint members of election boards and handing it to the state auditor. The current and incoming governors are both Democrats, and the state auditor is a Republican.</p><p>“The Democrats are trying and have tried multiple ways to prevent citizen checks on the system,” said Dallas Woodhouse, a conservative columnist and former executive director of the state Republican Party.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Gerry Cohen, a Democratic member of the Wake County elections board who has been involved in election challenges and protests for more than five decades, called the demands of Judge Griffin’s protest “head and shoulders above anything I have ever seen.”</p><p>“It seems to me to be an enormous stretch,” he said.</p><p>This being North Carolina, no one is writing the protest off.</p><p>The unstated goal of the protest is to disqualify enough voters to exceed the 734-vote margin of Judge Griffin’s loss. That would trigger a state law requiring a new election. The elections board plans to discuss the protest on Wednesday.</p><p>Judge Griffin’s lawyers have <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/griffin-petition-supreme-court-nc.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked a state court</a> to order the elections board to act quickly on the protest, accusing the board of “decades of lawlessness” for failing to enforce the 2004 law outlining the voter registration form. They said that even when the board discovered its error in 2023, it did not make voters correct their earlier omissions.</p><p>In its lawsuit, the state Democratic Party noted that federal law prohibits states from tossing out a ballot because a voter’s registration papers lack a driver’s license or Social Security number.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>National and state Republican Party lawyers raised the same claim about missing registration numbers earlier this year in a state lawsuit that sought to strike as many as 225,000 voters from the rolls. The case was later moved to a federal court, which said that a ruling, whenever it comes, should not apply to this election.</p><p>How state courts might revisit Judge Griffin’s protest has not been addressed. But if they did, the issue probably would wind up in the same state Supreme Court where Ms. Riggs is one of two Democrats — and where the ideological divide with the five Republican justices is both open and bitter.</p><p>“The question is, can the Republicans take what’s going on here and turn it into a semi-legitimate case?” said Pope McCorkle III, known as Mac, a former Democratic political consultant and professor of public policy at Duke University. “If they can, Riggs might lose.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Wines is a national correspondent, writing about voting and election issues.
