It suggested they might have advanced the proposal because they “just want a few nights in Jackson to lobby for this idea — at public expense.”</p><p>Clarksdale city officials sued The Press Register for libel on Feb. 14, saying that the editorial “chilled and hindered” the mayor’s ability to lobby for the legislation in Jackson, the state capital.</p><p>On Feb. 18, Judge Martin granted the city’s request for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/us/mississippi-judge-newspaper-editorial.html" title="">a temporary restraining order</a> and required the newspaper to remove the editorial from its website.</p><p>“The injury in this case is defamation against public figures through actual malice in reckless disregard of the truth and interferes with their legitimate function to advocate for legislation they believe would help their municipality during this current legislative cycle,” she wrote.</p><p>Groups that advocate for the news media fiercely criticized the order, calling it a clear violation of the right to free speech. <a href="http://press.org/newsroom/national-press-club-statement-judge-ordering-mississippi-newspaper-remove-editorial" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The National Press Club</a>, for instance, said that courts had made clear that “the government cannot silence a newspaper just because it doesn’t like what was printed.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Monday, Clarksdale officials voted to drop their lawsuit. The mayor, Chuck Espy, said that the city had decided to reverse course because Mr. Emmerich had offered to publish a “clarification” acknowledging that some of the language in the editorial was not clear.</p><p>“We are not here to fight with the newspaper,” Mr. Espy said. “We just want the truth to be printed, bad or good. That’s all we’ve asked for.”</p><p>Mr. Emmerich said that he had initially suggested publishing a clarification in hopes of persuading the city not to file a lawsuit. But he said that offer “went off the table and they knew that.”</p><p>David Rubin, a lawyer at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a legal advocacy group that represented The Press Register, said in <a href="https://www.thefire.org/news/victory-mississippi-town-votes-drop-lawsuit-had-forced-newspaper-take-down-editorial" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> that the demise of the case was an important victory.</p><p>“The implications of this case go beyond one Mississippi town censoring its paper of record,” Mr. Rubin said. “If the government can get a court order silencing mere questions about its decisions, the First Amendment rights of all Americans are in jeopardy.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
