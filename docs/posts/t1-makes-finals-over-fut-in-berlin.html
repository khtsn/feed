</span>. The Turkish team failed to find a way past T1&#39;s individuals who took turns providing high-impact kills. T1 looked dominant on Bind and narrowly closed out Ascent, which came on either side of a blowout on Pearl.</p>


<p><em>BuZz had FUT&#39;s number in the first half.</em></p>

<p>FUT got off to an explosive start on Bind with pistol and bonus round wins. T1 could thank back-to-back multikills from <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/804/buzz">
		BuZz	</a>
</span> for cutting FUT&#39;s momentum and giving his team a way back into the game. The Koreans led 7-5 before halftime with an ace from <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/8369/yetujey">
		yetujey	</a>
</span> breaking up seven dominant rounds from T1.</p>


<p><em>yetujey&#39;s ace gave FUT an extra round in the first half.</em></p>

<p>Unfortunately for FUT, T1 wouldn&#39;t slow down in the second half and took six straight to close out the map 13-5. <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/29833/izu">
		iZu	</a>
</span> and BuZz had particularly standout performances with the latter&#39;s multikills and the former&#39;s consistency across the map ensuring a T1 victory.</p>

<p>T1&#39;s pick, Pearl, kicked off with another strong start from FUT, going up 7-0 with an unorthodox double-sentinel comp featuring Vyse and Killjoy. T1&#39;s insistence on ignoring the B site worked perfectly for FUT as T1 struggled to get the spike planted. FUT closed out their defense with a 9-3 score before picking up the second pistol to go up 11-3. Afterwards, it was a mere formality for FUT to close out Pearl 13-3 and force a third map.</p>

<p>New addition <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/12793/xeus">
		xeus	</a>
</span> was the MVP for FUT as the 20-year-old duelist picked up 22 kills and 225 ADR on the second map.</p>


<p><em>xeus closed out the map with a 4K.</em></p>

<p>The third map, Ascent, opened with FUT picking up another pistol, their fourth of the series. A 4K from xeus&#39; Yoru in the bonus led FUT to a 5-0 start before T1 could respond with a thrifty. Impressive holds from T1&#39;s individuals shut down FUT&#39;s site executes to force a 6-6 half.</p>


<p><em>xeus excelled on the off-meta Yoru.</em></p>

<p>T1 took a crucial pistol and bonus in the second half to take a commanding 9-6 lead on the decider. T1&#39;s midrounding ran circles around FUT on their attack, suffocating their opponent&#39;s map control. T1 closed out Ascent 13-10 with an A hit to take the series 2-1.</p>

<p>BuZz had an impressive 251 ACS and 20 kills on the final map.</p>


<p><em>Meteor&#39;s mechanics were on point during all three maps.</em></p>

<p>T1 will play Cloud9 in a best-of-five grand final, while FUT has been eliminated.</p>
