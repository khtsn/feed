Her devotees are still sweating through workouts at a faded gym in Queens.</p><p><time datetime="2025-05-21T10:48:15-04:00"><span>May 21, 2025</span><span>Updated <span>10:48 a.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>On a busy thoroughfare in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens sits a women-only gym with faded hot pink signage. It is the last surviving location of Lucille Roberts, a chain of women’s health clubs that once thrived in New York, leading a trend that fused fitness with feminism. Now that it has dwindled down to just one location, its most loyal members have ended up here.</p><p>Women in their 50s and 60s who have worked out for decades at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/18/nyregion/lucille-roberts-59-founder-of-fitness-chain-for-women.html" title="">Lucille Roberts</a> now take classes including Zumba and “Brazilian Butt and Gutt” in a fluorescent-lit studio. They have little interest in going anywhere else. Signs on the walls remind members not to leave their purses and handbags unattended when they’re using the machines. A magenta poster announces: “Strong Women Work Out Here.”</p><p>On a recent afternoon at this gym on <a href="https://www.lucilleroberts.com/clubs/lr-forest-hills" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Austin Street</a>, members explained why they have stuck with Lucille Roberts long after it was a leader in its field, with more than 50 locations in the New York area.</p><p>Marguerite Toussaint pumped some iron after finishing her morning shift as a hotel pastry cook at the Park Hyatt in Manhattan. She has been a Lucille Roberts member since the mid-1990s, when she signed up at a location in Brooklyn, not long after she moved from Haiti to New York. She wakes up each workday before dawn and trains here on her way home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“All of us hope this gym never closes,” Ms. Toussaint said. “It’s not like other gyms. It’s a community for women. We care about each other here. If you don’t see somebody, you call and find out. ‘Hey, why didn’t I see you today?’ I don’t see that at Planet Fitness.”</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-5"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Marguerite Toussaint has been a Lucille Roberts member since the mid-1990s.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A member stretches at the chain’s last location.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-03-kzjp/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-03-kzjp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-03-kzjp/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-03-kzjp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-03-kzjp/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-03-kzjp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A woman wearing black workout clothes does a standing stretch in a mirrored room." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-03-kzjp/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-03-kzjp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-03-kzjp/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-03-kzjp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-03-kzjp/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-03-kzjp-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-03-kzjp/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-03-kzjp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/d331ca47-4289-5616-84d5-a6c0db3e7b19" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jennifer Gibson, a fitness instructor at the last location.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Patricia Holloman, a retired Queens Criminal Courthouse corrections officer, was careful of her long blue nails as she handled weights. “When I tell people I go to a Lucy Roberts, they’re always like, ‘That’s still around?’” she said. “But I’m proud to be a member. Women are just more pleasant to work out with.”</p><p>Roaming the gym to interview Lucille Roberts loyalists, I found myself in a bygone fitness era. The exercise studio’s décor included retro blue mirrored beams and dingy white ceiling tiles pocked with tiny holes. A group of three women in their 70s wearing fanny packs chatted as they pedaled on ellipticals. There were no eucalyptus-scented towels to be found. Some members mopped their brows with colorful kitchen rags brought from home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Huffing on a treadmill was Alexandra Rodriguez, 44, who works at a bakery in Queens. “Some friends tell me the idea feels dated: ‘Why would you go to a women’s only gym?’” she said. “I tell them it’s empowering. Honestly, I’m surprised this is the last Lucille Roberts. You’d think a place like this would be more valuable to women now more than ever.”</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-10"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/20/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-vids-89748-cover/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-vids-89748-cover-square640.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/20/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-vids-89748-cover/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-vids-89748-cover-square640.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/05/20/140428_1_21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-vids-89748_wg_mobile_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-1a49eb14">A Forgotten Fitness Pioneer</h2><p>Long before these women formed their sisterhood, Lucille Roberts was a booming business with annual revenues of $50 million.

It’ll push you to the limit!” These deals were always about to end: “Just $8.95 per year! But hurry! Sale ends Tuesday!”</p><p>Everyone in New York in the 1990s heard the number to call — 1-800 USA Lucille — and saw the brand’s founder, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/28/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-ladies-of-the-gym-unite.html" title="">Lucille Roberts</a>, clad in a dark power suit as she enticed viewers to join her gym by saying in a no-nonsense New York accent: “The sooner you get started, the sooner you’ll get results.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lucille Roberts at one of her gyms in the 1990s.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Roberts Family</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Ms. Roberts, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/18/nyregion/lucille-roberts-59-founder-of-fitness-chain-for-women.html" title="">died</a> of lung cancer at 59 in 2003, was the brand’s public face, and her story was a tale of New York reinvention that began in the ashes of war-torn Europe.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>An early fitness fanatic, she conceived the idea of a women-only club after a workout buddy complained about the leering eyes of men at gyms.

It was 1970, the year before Gloria Steinem co-founded Ms. magazine, and the Roberts’ first gym was right across the street from Macy’s in Midtown Manhattan.</p><p>Soon, the exercise bikes and vibrating belt machines were drawing a clientele of secretaries, nurses, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/nyregion/bells-are-still-ringing-if-less-often.html" title="">switchboard operators</a>, flight attendants and volunteers from Ms. Steinem’s Women’s Action Alliance.

I’m not surprised it’s the Forest Hills location.

From the far reaches of the Soviet Union, the family made its way to a displaced persons camp in Germany. When they came to the United States in the early 1950s, an official decided Laja needed a new name.</p><p>“Her name changed to Lucille at Ellis Island because Lucille Ball was popular,” Mr. Roberts said, referring to the star of the sitcom “I Love Lucy.” “They changed it from that beautiful name, Laja. She never talked about those years she spent at the camp, and I never pushed her to talk about it.”</p><p>The Spindels settled in the East Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, where Lucille soon got the hang of English and began mapping out her future.</p><p>“Like all survivors who came to America,” Mr. Roberts said, “she believed the streets of New York were paved with gold.

She met Mr. Roberts while dancing at a friend’s apartment party. At the time he went by his original surname, Robert Orefice. He was an Italian-American Catholic from Queens, and Lucille’s mother groused at first about his not being Jewish.</p><p>At their first gym, he worked the front desk while she led exercise classes. She taught aerobics on the same day she gave birth to her first child.</p><p>As they plotted an expansion, they decided the brand should carry her name — but they worried that Orefice wasn’t catchy. So they joined their first names to come up with Lucille Roberts. A few years later, they legally changed their surnames.</p><p>“She was a no-nonsense person,” Mr. Roberts said. “She took no bull. Men can beat around the bush when it comes to business, but not her. Lucille was a very direct businesswoman. I think it all went back to how she grew up.

The family’s main residence was a townhouse on the Upper East Side and then a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/realestate/17scapes.html" title="">historic mansion</a> nearby. She was chauffeured around town in a black limousine and she spent summers at the family estate in Southampton. Yet she remained intensely involved with the chain, managing the front desk at newly opened clubs, filling in to teach classes when instructors called in sick and moving the corporate offices to the family home.</p><p>She didn’t smoke, which exacerbated her family’s anguish when she was diagnosed with lung cancer.</p><p>“The doctors had plenty of theories,” Mr. Roberts said. “When she was a baby in Siberia, she had a rheumatic fever that left a small scar on her lung.</p><p>“They operated on her and took out what they could, but it came back,” he continued. “I knew, and she knew, she wasn’t going to survive this. But she tried for three years, and every day we woke up and pretended like nothing was wrong.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-41"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/20/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-vids-62281-cover/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-vids-62281-cover-square640.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/20/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-vids-62281-cover/21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-vids-62281-cover-square640.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/05/20/140426_1_21ST-LUCILLE-ROBERTS-vids-62281_wg_mobile_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><h2 id="link-69751372">The Mansion</h2><p>The majestic limestone <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/an-opulent-109-year-old-new-york-city-mansion-lists-for-dollar59-million" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mansion</a> on East 80th Street where Ms. Roberts spent the final years of her life was the ultimate manifestation of her success.</p><p>Just a block from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it was built in the 1910s for an heiress to the retail titan <a href="https://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2011/03/gift-from-father-no-4-east-80th-street.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Frank Woolworth</a>.
