The crew of Delta Flight 4819 heroically led passengers to safety.”</p><p>As investigators from safety boards in Canada and the United States, as well as the regional jet’s manufacturer, began combing over the wreckage, there was no official word on what caused the crash. They are expected to look into a range of factors, according to aviation safety experts.</p><p>“Everything’s on the table: The wind, the pilot performance, the airplane, all those things will be looked at in detail,” said John Cox, a former airline pilot and founder of Safety Operating Systems, an aviation consulting firm.</p><p>The plane approached the runway on Monday in windy conditions that former pilots described as challenging.</p><p>For the 80 people on board the flight from Minneapolis, the world lurched immediately after the wheels hit the ground.<span>  </span>In the blink of an eye, passengers found themselves hanging upside down, still strapped to their seats as jet fuel ran down the windows, said Pete Carlson, one of the passengers.</p><p>“The absolute initial feeling is just, ‘Need to get out of this,’” Mr. Carlson <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9paRHkZwZo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told CBC</a>, the Canadian public broadcaster.</p><p>But after a horrific <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/world/canada/plane-crash-travel.html" title="">string of fatal aviation accidents</a> over the past two months, this crash proved different.</p><p>The seatbelts that passenger had strapped on to prepare for landing likely contributed to the lack of a more catastrophic outcome, aviation experts said. Flight attendants and passengers were then able to help each other out of the emergency exits and, with the assistance of firefighters, onto the snowy runway.</p><p>Delta said that 21 passengers had been transported to local hospitals after the crash. By Tuesday morning, all but two had been released, the airline said.</p><p>Dianna Ertl, the mother of one of the passengers, said that her son, Mitch Ertl, 37, had been treated at a hospital and would be returning home to Minnesota on Tuesday. He had been on a business trip.</p><p>“My heart sank,” said Ms. Ertl, describing the phone call she got from her son.</p><p>Mr. Ertl told her that he had been one of the last people to exit the plane, and that he had needed to break a meal tray table that was blocking him from unbuckling his seatbelt, she said.</p><p>“I felt relieved that I was talking to him, that I knew he was walking,” Ms. Ertl said.</p><p>The crew of an air ambulance waiting to take off captured the moment of the crash-landing <a href="https://x.com/fl360aero/status/1891805600838766911" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on video.</a> The video, which spread on social media and was verified by The New York Times, may offer clues about what caused the plane to end up flipped over on its back.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-1"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="delta-crash-frames-j8csi" data-id="100000009996940" data-source-id="100000009996940"><div slug="delta-crash-frames-j8csi" data-sourceid="100000009996940" id="embed-id-100000009996940">

The <a href="https://weather.gc.ca/canada_e.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">government’s weather service</a> said that gusts of up to 38 miles an hour were recorded as the plane was landing. </p><p>Investigators will probably closely evaluate parts recovered from the crash to understand whether they were faulty beforehand, experts said. And the plane’s black boxes — a cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, which have been sent to labs for analysis — will be crucial in explaining what happened, helping shed light on the force and angle at which the plane landed.</p><p>“I think that the flight data recorder will quickly determine whether or not this landing was quote-unquote hard,” said Jeff Guzzetti, a safety consultant and former investigator for the Federal Aviation Administration and the N.T.S.B.</p><p>The crash provides some positive lessons, too.</p><p>The seatbelts that passengers were required under Canadian law to wear during landing worked as intended, keeping them strapped in even as the plane rolled over. And so did the seats that were bolted to the aircraft’s structure and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/30/business/30planes.html" title="">designed to withstand</a> stresses of up to 16 times the force of gravity.</p><p>That the exit doors could still be opened underscored the construction quality of the plane, said Mr. Cox, the former airline pilot. And the ability of the crew to open those doors, even while upside down, and to get passengers out quickly, was a testament to their training.</p><p>Mr. Carlson, who had a scrape visible on his head, said he had seen a woman who had ended up under a seat and a mother and a boy who were sitting on the ceiling of the aircraft.</p><p>“My fatherly instinct and background as a paramedic kind of kicked in,” he said, recounting that he helped make sure hey all got off the plane.</p><p>Even in those panicky moments, there was a palpable camaraderie as people escape, he said. “Everyone on that plane suddenly became very close in terms of how to help one another, how to console one another,” he said. “That was powerful.”</p><p>Jet fuel was running down the airplane’s windows, Mr. Carlson said. After leaving the plane, he and others tried to move as far from it as possible once he noticed that a wing was missing and heard sounds of an explosion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The weather advisories for Toronto Pearson International Airport at the time of the crash “indicated a gusting crosswind and blowing snow.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ian Willms for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Emerging from the upside-down plane, onto the tarmac and into the blowing snow on Monday, Mr. Carlson said, “it felt like I was stepping onto the tundra.”</p><p>“I didn’t care how cold it was,” he said. “I didn’t care how far I had to walk, how long I had to stand.
