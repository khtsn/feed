Luggage and personal belongings were scattered across the waters’ banks. The number of dead was expected to rise from the crash, officials said, which occurred at about 4:30 a.m. local time.</p><p>The public prosecutor’s office, which released the death toll in a statement, said it was investigating the crash.</p><p>The bus driver may have lost control of the vehicle because of a mechanical failure, causing it to collide with two other vehicles, said Carlos Hernández, a spokesman for Guatemala City’s fire department. Mr. Hernández, however, cautioned that an investigation into the accident was still ongoing. Local media outlets published security-camera footage of the bus, which appeared to be speeding right before the collision.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>President Bernardo Arévalo of Guatemala declared a day of national mourning and ordered the army to mobilize and support rescue efforts.</p><p>“I stand in solidarity with the families of the victims who today woke up to heartbreaking news,” Mr. Arévalo said in a televised address to the nation. “Their pain is my pain.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maria Abi-Habib is an investigative correspondent reporting on Latin America and is based in Mexico City.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maria-abi-habib">More about Maria Abi-Habib</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
