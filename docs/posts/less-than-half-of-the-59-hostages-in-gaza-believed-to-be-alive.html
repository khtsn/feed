Of the 251 people seized and taken into Gaza during the attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, 130 or more hostages have been released. The Israeli military has retrieved the bodies of at least 40 others.</p><p>In January, Israel and Hamas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/world/middleeast/gaza-ceasefire-what-we-know.html" title="">agreed to a multi-stage truce</a> that would allow for the exchange of Hamas-captured hostages in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel.</p><p>The first phase of the cease-fire ended in early March. Hamas released <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-cease-fire-first-phase.html" title="">30 Israeli and foreign hostages</a> and handed over eight bodies, in exchange for the Israeli release of over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Several hostages had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-rescued-hamas-gaza.html" title="">already been rescued or released</a> before the two sides reached the agreement.</p><p>The fate of the cease-fire was unclear, though, after Israel resumed heavy strikes into Gaza on Tuesday, citing Hamas’s repeated refusal to release the remaining hostages. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/world/middleeast/trump-hamas-warning-hostages-gaza.html?smid=url-share" title="">President Trump sent warnings</a> to Hamas militants to immediately release the remaining hostages in Gaza or face death.</p><p>Hamas accused Israel early Tuesday of overturning the cease-fire, “exposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jin-yu-young">More about Jin Yu Young</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
