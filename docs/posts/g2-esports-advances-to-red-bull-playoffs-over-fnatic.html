</span>. </p>

<p>On top of determining which team would go home, this series also served as a rematch of the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/378832/g2-esports-vs-fnatic-valorant-champions-2024-lr1" target="_blank">Champions 2024 lower round 1</a>, where FNATIC eliminated G2 in 2-0 fashion.</p>

<p>The match kicked off on FNATIC&#39;s map pick of Haven, where they dominated FOKUS 13-4 yesterday. They opted for their signature Yoru-Iso composition, while G2 brought out a standard Neon-Breach. </p>

<p>Despite FNATIC&#39;s exceptional winrate on the map, G2 was in control throughout the first half on their defense, consistently countering FNATIC&#39;s pressure around the map with proactive reclears and coordinated floods to take an 8-4 lead.</p>

<p>A second pistol win for G2 seemed to set them up for a simple win. However, reality was more complicated, as the next three rounds saw three back-and-forth round wins by the team with worse weaponry. G2 eventually stabilized in the chaos with two strong C hits to get up to 12-8. The North American squad went on to win Haven 13-9, delivering FNATIC their first loss on the map of 2024. </p>


<p><em>kaajak and Alfajer nail clean Sheriff shots to take the first of multiple consecutive thrifties.</em></p>

<p><span data-ref-id="6">

</span> achieved the highest rating in the server with a 1.47 rating, 250 ACS, and 20 kills to 13 deaths. However, it was <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9810/alfajer">
		Alfajer	</a>
</span> leading in almost every category with 316 ACS, 24 kills, 8 of which first kills, and 215 ADR.</p>

<p>The next map was G2&#39;s pick of Bind. Both teams selected relatively standard compositions, with Alfajer notably playing Raze for FNATIC and <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9554/kaajak">
		kaajak	</a>
</span> playing Gekko instead. </p>

<p>G2&#39;s defense half on Bind proved to be even stronger than it was on Haven as they chained a pistol win into a bonus. FNATIC almost managed to win a thrifty in round 4 off the back of sharp Sheriff shots from kaajak, but <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3993/jawgemo">
		jawgemo	</a>
</span> won out a 1v2 to secure the round.</p>


<p><em>jawgemo picks up the pieces for his team in the clutch.</em></p>

<p>From there, the rest of the game was smooth sailing for G2; they consistently burned down the clock, either cleanly retaking the sites or denying FNATIC the opportunity to plant altogether. This time, G2 easily carried forward the momentum from a second pistol win to win Bind 13-2. <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7873/leaf">
		leaf	</a>
</span> dominated the opposition with an outsized 2.22 rating, 419 ACS, 93% KAST, and 26 kills to only 7 deaths.</p>
