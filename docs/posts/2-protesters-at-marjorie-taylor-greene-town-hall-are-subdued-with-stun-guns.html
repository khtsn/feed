As her supporters stood and clapped, several police officers grabbed the man, later identified by the police as Andrew Russell Nelms of Atlanta, and dragged him out of the room.</p><p>“I can’t breathe!” Mr. Nelms shouted, interjecting with expletives as he was told to put his arms behind his back. The police then used a stun gun on him twice.</p><p>Back inside the room, Ms. Greene was unfazed as she greeted attendees at the event, in Acworth, Ga., northwest of Atlanta. She thanked the officers, drawing applause from the crowd of about 150 people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“If you want to shout and chant, we will have you removed just like that man was thrown out,” she said. “We will not tolerate it!”</p><p>Minutes later, as Ms. Greene started to play a video of former President Barack Obama discussing the national debt, police forcibly removed and used a stun gun on a second man, identified later as Johnny Keith Williams of Dallas, Ga., who had stood up and started to heckle.</p><p>Over the next hour, as Ms. Greene trumpeted the efforts of the Department of Government Efficiency to shrink the government and played clips of herself railing against witnesses in committee hearings, police officers escorted at least six people from the room, according to a spokesman for the Acworth Police Department. Three people, including the two who were subdued with stun guns, were arrested.</p><p>In between disruptions at the event, Ms. Greene applauded the Trump administration’s deportation efforts and praised Congress for passing the Laken Riley Act, a measure that requires the detention of undocumented immigrants accused of certain crimes. Ms. Greene crowed about the DOGE team’s push to shutter the U.S. Agency for International Development. Instead of taking questions directly from the audience, she read and answered prescreened questions from a slide deck.</p><p>“Why is M.T.G. supporting Musk and DOGE and the slashing of Medicaid, Social Security offices, libraries and more?” read one question from a person identified only as Sarah. “This is outrageous.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Well, Sarah, unfortunately, you’re being brainwashed by the news that you’re watching,” Ms. Greene replied, to whoops and cheers from the crowd.</p><p>Mike Binns, a constituent who was escorted from the room after he yelled at Ms. Greene, said the event felt more like a “political rally” than a town hall.</p><p>Outside, several hundred protesters lined the street, waving signs that bore phrases such as “Pro America, Anti Trump” and “Resist!”</p><p>Asked if she thought using stun guns on protesters at the event was an appropriate response, Ms. Greene reiterated her praise for the law enforcement officials.</p><p>“You know who was out of line? The protesters,” Ms. Greene said. “There was a place designated outside for the protesters because we support their First Amendment rights.”</p><p>Sean Keenan<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maya C.
