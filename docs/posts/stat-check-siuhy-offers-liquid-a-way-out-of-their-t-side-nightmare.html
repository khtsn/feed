Forecasters warned that the floods might continue well into next week, with rivers not expected to crest in some places until Tuesday or Wednesday.</p><p>“We’ll be dealing with the river flooding the next couple days, even the next couple weeks in some places,” said Colby Pope, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Little Rock, Ark.</p><p>Emergency workers reported water rescues in Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Texas.

The river is expected to continue rising there through Sunday morning, with an evening crest expected just below record levels. Emergency responders, including an urban search and rescue team, were waiting in Poplar Bluff on Saturday, preparing to help evacuate people if needed.</p><p>Elsewhere, water levels were increasing quickly on the Kaskaskia River in Illinois, the Mississippi River along the Missouri-Kentucky border and the Ohio River along the Illinois-Kentucky border. Many highways have closed in Indiana and Ohio, though some rivers there are not expected to reach peak levels for several more days.

While there’s a chance for rain along the East Coast, the heaviest rains are expected in the southeast from the Gulf Coast to the Southern Appalachians. In northern Kentucky, another inch or two of rain is still expected before the long stretch of bad weather finally clears, said Nate McGinnis, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Wilmington, Ohio. But the flood risk is not as high as it was on Friday and Saturday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Still, places across the storm’s path, including Louisville, Ky., and Memphis, have prepared for conditions to worsen.
