Trump’s inauguration, a spokesman said, extending a long-running feud between Mr. Trump and one of his chief antagonists from his first term.</p><p>The spokesman did not specify why Ms. Pelosi would not attend, but the former speaker has made no secret of her disdain for Mr. Trump, calling him unfit for office and a “stain on our country.” She led a chamber that impeached him twice, and she memorably ripped up a copy of one of his State of the Union addresses while standing behind him on national television.</p><p>Ms. Pelosi, 84, is still recovering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/us/pelosi-hip-replacement-surgery.html" title="">from a hip replacement after falling</a> while on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/us/politics/nancy-pelosi-hospitalized-luxembourg-falling.html" title="">an official trip to Luxembourg</a>, but she has been attending votes in the House and the injury has not kept her away from other parts of her job.</p><p>As the leader of the Democratic minority at the time, she attended Mr. Trump’s first inauguration in 2017, <a href="https://x.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/822481527468658688" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wearing a button</a> protesting Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/us/repeal-affordable-care-act-donald-trump.html" title="">effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act</a>. But as a retired leader, she has more flexibility to skip Washington ceremonies and make a statement with her absence. She also skipped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/politics/netanyahu-congress.html" title="">an address by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel</a> to a joint session of Congress last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Pelosi frequently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/us/politics/nancy-pelosi-donald-trump.html" title="">sparred verbally with Mr. Trump</a> from the minority, and from nearly the moment Democrats took back the House majority in 2019, Ms. Pelosi and the president clashed in weighty political struggles over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/us/politics/trump-congress-shutdown.html" title="">government funding</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/us/politics/pelosi-articles-of-impeachment.html" title="">his first impeachment</a>. Their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/us/politics/government-shutdown-trump-senate.html" title="">in-person meetings</a> also featured fireworks, including when Mr. Trump refused to shake hands with Ms. Pelosi <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/us/politics/pelosi-trump-handshake.html" title="">at his 2020 State of the Union address</a> and then she tore up his speech.</p><p>The animosity between the two leaders reached a fever pitch on Jan. 6, 2021, as a mob of Mr. Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol, and a rioter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/us/politics/jan-6-pelosi-trump.html" title="">vandalized Ms. Pelosi’s office and posed for a photo with a boot on her desk</a>. Days later, Ms. Pelosi <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/us/politics/trump-impeached.html" title="">moved to impeach Mr. Trump a second time</a>. After an intruder invaded Ms. Pelosi’s San Francisco home and attacked her husband, Paul, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/us/politics/pelosi-attack-republicans-trump.html" title="">amplified a baseless conspiracy theory</a> that the attack was not genuine.</p><p>“What was sad about it, too, for my children, my grandchildren, my husband and for me was that President Trump thought it was funny,” Ms. Pelosi <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/magazine/nancy-pelosi-election-interview.html#:~:text=They%20violated%20the%20sanctity%20of%20our%20home" title="">said in an interview with The New York Times in November</a>. “He made a joke of it.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Annie Karni is a congressional correspondent for The Times.
