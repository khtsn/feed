    <h1>Trump Administration Puts Dozens of U.S.A.I.D. Officials on Paid Leave</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>U.S.A.I.D. officials did not immediately return a request for comment.</p><p>With a budget of $22.6 billion, U.S.A.I.D.’s global work also includes disaster relief, aid for refugees and anti-poverty programs.</p><p>The agency’s supporters say that its efforts earn the United States enormous good will internationally and also promote political stability that serves the country’s security interests — all for about 0.2 percent of the federal budget. But many conservatives have long questioned foreign aid programs, and Mr. Trump and his allies are determined to slash federal spending wherever possible.</p><p>Mr. Gray’s email appears to reflect Trump officials’ determination to ensure that federal workers carry out even his most dramatic orders — and to move them out of the way if they will not. In this case, the directive in question is almost certainly an executive order Mr. Trump signed last week to freeze nearly all U.S. foreign aid funded by U.S.A.I.D. and the State Department.</p><p>“He is initiating a review of all foreign assistance programs to ensure they are efficient and consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda,” the State Department spokeswoman, Tammy Bruce, said in a statement on Friday.</p><p>The order does not apply to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/06/us/politics/israel-us-weapons.html" title="">weapons support</a> to Israel and Egypt, or to emergency food assistance, according to a memo issued by Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday.</p></div></div>
