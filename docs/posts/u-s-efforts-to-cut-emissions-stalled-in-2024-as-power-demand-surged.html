Scientists say all major economies would have to cut their emissions deeply this decade to keep global warming at relatively low levels.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Since 2005, United States emissions have fallen roughly 20 percent, a significant drop at a time when the economy has also expanded. But to meet its climate goals, U.S. emissions would need to decline nearly 10 times as fast each year as they’ve fallen over the past decade. That seems increasingly unlikely, experts say, especially since President-elect Donald J. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/climate/trump-climate-change.html" title="">has promised to dismantle</a> Mr. Biden’s climate policies and promote the production of fossil fuels, the burning of which generates greenhouse gases.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“On the one hand, it is notable that we’ve now seen two years in a row where the U.S. economy grew but emissions went down,” said Ben King, an associate director at the Rhodium Group. “But it’s far from enough to achieve our climate targets.”</p><p>The biggest reason that U.S. emissions have fallen in recent years is that electric utilities have been retiring their older, dirtier coal-fired power plants <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/02/climate/electricity-generation-us-states.html" title="">and replacing them</a> with cheaper and less-polluting natural gas, wind and solar power. That trend mostly continued last year, with a few unexpected ups and downs.</p><p>The nation’s demand for electricity, which has stayed more or less flat for two decades, suddenly jumped by roughly 3 percent in 2024, in large part because scorching heat during the summer caused many Americans to crank up their air-conditioners. A smaller factor was that tech companies have been building more energy-hungry data centers in states like Virginia and Texas.</p><p>While power companies installed large numbers of wind turbines, solar panels and batteries last year to meet rising demand, natural gas use also rose to record highs, while coal use declined only slightly. The net result was that emissions from the power sector increased an estimated 0.2 percent, according to the Rhodium Group.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In the future, rising electricity demand could pose a major challenge to American efforts to cut emissions. As interest in artificial intelligence grows, tech companies like Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/climate/artificial-intelligence-power-emissions.html" title="">are building massive data centers</a> that require enormous amounts of power. Over the next few years, many utilities are planning to meet this demand, at least in part, by <a href="https://floodlightnews.org/coal-was-on-its-way-out-but-surging-electricity-demand-is-keeping-it-alive/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">delaying retirements of existing coal plants</a> or <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/241022-data-centers-more-gas-will-be-needed-to-feed-u-s-growth-13290987" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">burning more natural gas</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>At the same time, transportation, the nation’s largest source of greenhouse gases, saw an 0.8 percent rise in emissions last year. Gasoline and jet fuel consumption both increased as Americans continued to drive and fly more after the pandemic. Nearly 10 percent of new car sales in 2024 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/business/ford-gm-vehicle-sales.html" title="">were less-polluting electric vehicles</a>, but those models still make up a small fraction of total cars on the road and have yet to put a major dent in transportation emissions.</p><p>On the flip side, emissions from America’s industrial sector — which includes steel, cement and chemicals — fell by 1.8 percent in 2024. Some of that may have been the result of lost output, as two hurricanes and a strike at the nation’s ports disrupted some factory activity in the fall, Mr. King said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“It’s a reminder that there’s always some bumpiness in emissions,” Mr. King said. “It’s not just a question of how many electric vehicles are on the road or how much solar we’ve installed. A big portion of our economy still relies on fossil fuels.”</p><p>One of the most striking findings in this year’s data was that emissions from oil and gas operations dropped roughly 3.7 percent in 2024. Even though the United States produced record amounts of oil and near-record amounts of natural gas last year, many companies appear to have curbed leaks of methane, which is the main ingredient in natural gas and which can seep into the atmosphere and contribute significantly to global warming.</p><p>Over the past few years, the Biden administration and several states have adopted new regulations that require oil and gas producers to detect and fix methane leaks. Many companies also have financial incentives to capture methane to sell rather than vent it into the air.</p><p>Between 2014 and 2024, U.S. companies appear to have reduced the amount of methane that escaped, per each cubic feet of gas they produced, by 40 percent, according to the Rhodium Group.</p><p>Several experts <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg3781" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have estimated</a> that greenhouse gases generated in the United States could start dropping sharply in the years ahead if many clean energy policies stay in place, particularly the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into low-carbon energy technologies such as electric vehicles, wind turbines, solar panels, nuclear reactors, green hydrogen and batteries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>While Mr. Trump has pledged to scrap many of Mr. Biden’s subsidies and tax credits for electric vehicles and low-carbon energy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/climate/ira-renewable-energy-tax-credits.html" title="">it remains to be seen</a> whether Congress will agree.</p><p>That law has not yet had a major impact on the country’s emissions, said Mr. King, since it takes time for new factories to open and power plants to get built. But, he said, data shows that low-carbon energy and transportation now make up fully 5 percent of total U.S. private investment.</p><p>“That’s a leading indicator that things are changing quickly,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Brad Plumer is a Times reporter who covers technology and policy efforts to address global warming.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/brad-plumer">More about Brad Plumer</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
