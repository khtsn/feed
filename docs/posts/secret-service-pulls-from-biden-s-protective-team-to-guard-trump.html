Trump’s security in a variety of ways since the assassination attempt on him last month, several people familiar with the matter said on Thursday, including by temporarily shifting part of President Biden’s protective team to Mr. Trump.</p><p>The Secret Service has also secured ballistic glass, which is designed to repel bullets, to provide enhanced protection for Mr. Trump at future outdoor campaign rallies, those people added, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential methods.</p><p>The reassignment of members of a president’s team to a candidate is unusual, said a Secret Service official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential policy matters. But the increased threat of violence against Mr. Trump, combined with Mr. Biden’s recent reduced travel schedule, made the step both necessary and feasible, the official added.</p><p>A White House spokesman had no immediate comment, and a Trump campaign spokeswoman declined to comment.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Secret Service has been under a cloud since July 13, when a gunman was able to fire, unimpeded, on Mr. Trump at an outdoor campaign rally in Butler, Pa. The attack grazed Mr. Trump’s ear, killed a spectator and seriously wounded two others. The F.B.I. is investigating, and congressional leaders have also opened inquiries.</p><p>The Secret Service has taken responsibility for the security lapses that made the shooting possible. Kimberly A. Cheatle resigned as the agency’s director and has been replaced. But even as it reels from its worst presidential security breach in more than four decades, the agency has had to continue its mission of protecting three dozen current and former officials, and their families, through what is proving to be a challenging and intense presidential campaign year.</p><p>Secret Service methodology “is made to be flexible,” said Donald Mihalek, who worked for the agency for two decades before retiring in 2019, “and to address known, and unknown, threats. The steps the Secret Service is taking are a natural part of its asymmetrical approach to assure their no-fail mission is fulfilled.”</p><p>Mr. Mihalek, who helped protect several presidents during his years in the service, said that he had occasionally seen members of a president’s team reassigned to other jobs for periods of time, especially during United Nations events.</p><p>The agency’s presidential protective division, as the group is known, is used for high-level protective details because of its experience and expertise, he said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The division consists of hundreds of Secret Service employees who fan out across the White House compound to fulfill various security roles and also travel with the president, according to the current service official as well as former agents. Because Mr. Biden has traveled relatively little since dropping his re-election bid on July 21, division members who would typically travel and do advance work are now available to work with Mr. Trump’s team, the official said.</p><p>It is rare — though not unheard-of — to use ballistic glass for those being protected other than the sitting president and vice president, partly because the material is heavy to move, current and former Secret Service officials said. The glass is usually transported by military planes, these people said, easing the logistical burden on the Secret Service.</p><p>In the case of Mr. Trump, whose potential use of ballistic glass for future campaign events was reported earlier by <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/secret-service-prepares-bulletproof-glass-outdoor-trump-rallies/story?id=112847263" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ABC News</a>, the glass will be positioned at various points around the country for ease of use, a service official said.</p><p>Mr. Trump held an outdoor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/trump-press-conference.html" title="">news conference</a> on Thursday at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., but he has not held an outdoor rally since the one in Butler.</p><p>He has said he would like to return to the Butler area for a future event.</p><p>“We’re going to go back in October,” he said in an interview with the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk this week.</p><p>Michael Gold<!-- --> contributed reporting from Bedminster, N.J.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Kate Kelly covers money, policy and influence for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kate-kelly">More about Kate Kelly</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-secret-service">U.S. Secret Service</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="NYT_BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT_REGION" data-testid="region"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2024-election-footer-carousel" data-id="100000009577677" data-source-id="100000009577677"><div>
