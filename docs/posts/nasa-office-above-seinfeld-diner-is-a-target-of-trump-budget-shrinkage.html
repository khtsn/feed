So the annual rent of $3 million is still due, whether the scientists are there or not, according to a Columbia official with knowledge of the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal matters. That means that there is no cost savings to the government for vacating the offices — only disruption, at least for now.</p><p>“There is no logic behind this,” said Kostas Tsigaridis, a research scientist at the institute and at Columbia.</p><p>The move appears to be another instance of the chaos and confusion wrought by the Trump administration’s frenzied quest to cut government spending.</p><p>NASA first moved into Armstrong Hall in 1966, as part of an effort to encourage collaboration on space research between its scientists and researchers at universities in New York.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The work there proved foundational. The institute’s former director, James Hansen, was the first scientist to <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1988/06/24/350088.html?pageNumber=1" title="">sound the alarm</a> to Congress, in 1988, about greenhouse gases that were warming Earth. Its researchers were involved with robotic spacecraft missions to Venus and Jupiter. The climate model it runs predicts how Earth’s climate is changing and examines prospects for human habitation on Mars and other planets.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gavin Schmidt, the director of NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, at the offices.

It runs through August 2031. Columbia says the General Services Administration continues to pay the rent.</p><p>Columbia is now searching for new space for the scientists who work at the institute, many of whom also teach at the university.</p><p>“Columbia is fully committed to our longstanding collaboration with NASA and the scientific research at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies,” Millie Wert, a Columbia spokeswoman, said.</p><p>General Services officials did not respond to messages seeking comment.</p><p>The closure of the institute’s longtime home comes as another blow to the morale of Columbia-based scientists, who have watched funding evaporate for hundreds of federal grants this year because of cuts from the Trump administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Zachary McGraw, a post-doctoral student at the institute, rifles through books left out by staff members who don’t know where they will be working yet.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sara Naomi Lewkowicz for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>An administration antisemitism task force imposed about $400 million in cuts to federal research funding that Columbia receives, and further cuts were made to projects that focus on issues that include climate change and racial equity.

The institute, she wrote, “has a significant place in the history of space science and its work is critical for the Earth Science Division.”</p><p>But the scientists remain concerned.
