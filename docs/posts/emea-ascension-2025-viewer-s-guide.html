		<p>Eight teams will soon clash at the Riot Games Arena in Berlin, Germany to determine which two organizations will ascend to 2026&#39;s VCT EMEA. The action will begin on October 18 with a group stage followed by two thrilling qualification matches.</p>



<p>The following teams have qualified to Ascension through the EMEA Challengers ecosystem and are as follows:</p>



<p>Three different stages of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/vcl-2025/?region=27" target="_blank">EMEA Challengers</a> took place over the year, with multiple representatives from each subregion racking up important points to carry them over the line of qualification.</p>

<p>ULF Esports enter the competition through a direct bid courtesy of the third stage of EMEA Challengers, whereas the rest of the teams earned their spot thanks to the points accrued over the year. Following Team RA&#39;AD&#39;s <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/564957/team-raad-removed-from-emea-ascension-by-riot-replaced-by-joblife" target="_blank">removal</a>, Joblife have been slotted in as the next eligible team.</p>



<p>The eight teams will be separated into two groups of four, where a GSL format awaits. The top two teams are determined via a double-elimination format that pits teams with the same record against each other. Winning two games will earn a ticket to an Ascension match, whereas losing two games will effectively end a team&#39;s season.</p>

<p>Two Ascension matches await the four teams who advance out of the group stage. Teams will play a best-of-five match to determine who will ascend to next year&#39;s VCT EMEA.</p>

<p>All matches featured at EMEA&#39;s Ascension will be played on patch 11.07, disregarding the new competitive map pool.</p>



<p>A total of €100,000 will be split among the eight teams in the following manner:</p>

<ul>
<li>1st-2nd: €27,500</li>
<li>3rd-4th: €15,000</li>
<li>5th-6th: €5,000</li>
<li>7th-8th: €2,500</li>
</ul>

<p>EMEA Ascension will not host a live audience for the Group Stage. Instead, the first five days will produce a “casual couch broadcast” allowing for broadcast talent to relax alongside viewers. Occasional segments and interactive elements accompanied by guests, co-streamers, Ascension players, and more will spice up the viewing experience.</p>

<p>The final two show days will revert to a live audience at the Riot Games Arena.</p>

<p>Remote viewers can join the rest of the fans across multiple platforms. The main streams are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/valorant_emea" target="_blank">VCT EMEA Twitch</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@VALORANTEsportsEMEA/live" target="_blank">VCT EMEA YouTube</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Following the last match of the Group Stage, Riot will release a limited number of extra tickets for the final two Ascension Matches.</p>

<p><a href="https://emeatickets.valorantesports.com" target="_blank">Tickets</a> will go live on October 23.</p>
