Trump’s pick for attorney general, occasionally clashed with Democrats during a confirmation hearing.

Politics will not play a part. I’ve demonstrated that my entire career as a prosecutor.” “You joined Mr. Trump in working to overturn the 2020 election. You’ve repeatedly described investigations and prosecutions of Mr. Trump as witch hunts, and you have echoed his calls for investigating and prosecuting his political opponents. This flies in the face of evidence. These are the kinds of anti-democratic efforts that in the past you have defended. And it’s critical that we understand whether you remain supportive of Mr. Trump’s actions.” “What would you do if your career, D.O.J. prosecutors, came to you with a case to prosecute — grounded in the facts and law — but the White House directs you to drop the case?” “Senator, if I thought that would happen, I would not be sitting here today.” “But let’s imagine that once again President-elect Trump issues a directive or order to you or to the F.B.I. director that is outside the boundaries of ethics or law. What will you do?” “Senator, I will never speak on a hypothetical, especially one saying that the president would do something illegal.” “Weaponization of the Justice Department may well occur under your tenure, and we want to make sure that that’s not the case, that you remain independent, that you remain able to and willing to tell the president no when that’s necessary to protect the Constitution and the integrity of the Department.” “I think that is the whole problem with the weaponization that we have seen the last four years and what’s been happening to Donald Trump. They targeted his campaign. They have launched countless investigations against him. That will not be the case. If I am attorney general, I will not politicize that office. I will not target people simply because of their political affiliation. Justice will be administered even handedly throughout this country.” “Who won the 2020 presidential election?” “Joe Biden is the president of the United States.” “Ms. Bondi did you know that there is a difference between acknowledging it? And I can say that Donald Trump won the 2024 election. I may not like it, but I can say it.” “As the Florida attorney general, Ms. Bondi achieved numerous successes. She engaged in key initiatives to fight human trafficking, countered the opioid epidemic and protect consumers and protect the citizens of Florida from violence.” “Will you do everything within your power as attorney general to enforce the laws on the books, including the president’s executive orders, and help do everything you can in the Department of Justice to restore security to our southern border?” “Yes, senator. Absolutely.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/15/multimedia/15dc-bondi-writethru-TOP-qvcw/15dc-bondi-writethru-TOP-qvcw-threeByTwoLargeAt2X.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Pam Bondi, President-elect Donald J.

Trump’s pick for attorney general, refused to explicitly say that she would defy Mr. Trump’s pressure during a confirmation hearing on Wednesday, but she offered a blanket promise that “politics will not play a part” in deciding who to investigate.</p><p>Both Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee predicted that Ms. Bondi, a former attorney general of Florida, would be easily confirmed. Both sides expressed relief that Mr. Trump’s first pick, former Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, had stepped aside to give way to Ms. Bondi, who has prosecutorial experience and a more balanced temperament.</p><p>But the daylong hearing had its contentious moments as Democrats repeatedly accused her of dodging basic yes-or-no questions about election denialism, the potential prosecution of Mr. Trump’s political enemies — and how she would deal with attempts by Mr. Trump to influence the department’s actions.</p><p>“Politics has to be taken out of this system,” said Ms. Bondi, who repeatedly circled back to her argument that the Justice Department had been misused and misdirected under the Biden administration. “This department has been weaponized for years and years and years, and it has to stop.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Bondi, 59, sought to project the image of a tough, independent, crime-fighting prosecutor, and she repeatedly expressed loyalty to Mr. Trump and her belief that he had been the victim of politically motivated prosecutions by the Biden administration.</p><p>She did not endorse Mr. Trump’s contention that the special counsel who brought two criminal cases against him, Jack Smith, should be thrown out of the country, but said what she had “heard on the news” about his conduct was “horrible.”</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
