Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/climate/epa-trump-election.html" title="">could roll back environmental regulations</a>, including those that limit greenhouse gases, and continue development of fossil fuels. He could also pull out of international agreements to fight climate change, as he did in his first term as president.</p><p>“It will be extremely difficult for the world to take on the climate crisis if Trump is president of the United States,” said Lena Moffitt, executive director for Evergreen Action, a climate nonprofit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>A week after the Election Day, the world’s leaders will meet at COP29.

The world may now be on track to reach 3 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century, according to Dr. Otto and other climate scientists.</p><p>Last year<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/13/climate/cop28-climate-agreement.html" title="">,</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/13/climate/cop28-climate-agreement.html" title="">summit attendees pledged to transition away from fossil fuels</a>, but the pact came with heavy caveats. Dr. Otto said she hoped this year’s conference would create a stricter timeline for that transition that could hold countries accountable.</p><p>The group of nations also set up a damages fund to help poorer countries with historically low emissions adapt to climate change. The fund, <a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/PILL-HAMMERSLEY-Climate-loss-and-damage-fund.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">which currently has about $700 million pledged</a>, is dwarfed by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/climate/cop28-loss-and-damage.html" title="">hundreds of billions of dollars in climate-related damages</a> developing countries may incur by 2030.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Health workers tending to a person who fainted during a heat wave at the Acropolis of Greece last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Milos Bicanski/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“It’s a ridiculously and insultingly low sum of money to help the most vulnerable countries with dealing with the losses and damages,” Dr. Otto said. “That needs to be orders of magnitude bigger.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The new study showed that death tolls from extreme weather events are often higher in poor countries. Researchers culled the list of weather episodes from the International Disaster Database, and included three tropical cyclones, four heat waves, two floods and a drought. They noted that the high death toll was “a major underestimate,” with potentially millions of unreported heat-related deaths not included.</p><p>Europe faced well-documented heat waves in 2015, 2022 and 2023 that led to almost 94,000 deaths. Another <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-024-00783-2#:~:text=The%20record%2Dbreaking%20temperatures%20in,77%25%5D)%20to%20anthropogenic%20warming." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report released this week</a> shows that during a 2022 heat wave in Europe that caused 68,000 deaths, more than half of those deaths could be traced back to human-induced climate change.</p><p>But poor countries suffered more in extreme weather. In Somalia, a 2011 drought made worse by rising temperatures that sucked water vapor from plants led to 258,000 deaths; in Myanmar, Cyclone Nargis formed in 2008 over warmer seas and most likely had higher wind speeds and more intense precipitation as a result of climate change. It killed more than 138,000 people.</p><p>Climate attribution studies are now 20 years old, and more than <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-climate-change-affects-extreme-weather-around-the-world/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">500 have been published by researchers</a>.
