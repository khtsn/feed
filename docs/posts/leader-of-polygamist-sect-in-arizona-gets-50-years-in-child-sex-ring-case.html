Bateman, 48, of Colorado City, Ariz., led a group that victimized girls as young as 9.</p><p>Using his status as a self-declared prophet of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Mr. Bateman forced his child “brides” to participate in sexual activities with him and with other adult men and women, prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum.</p><p>Mr. Bateman was arrested in August 2022 when he was driving on a highway in Flagstaff, Ariz., pulling a box trailer with three young girls inside, along with a makeshift toilet, no air-conditioning, and a door that was not latched, prosecutors said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In April, he agreed to plead guilty to two federal charges: conspiracy to commit transportation of a minor for criminal sexual activity, and conspiracy to commit kidnapping.</p><p>Under the plea agreement, he had faced a sentence of 20 to 50 years in federal prison. But prosecutors had argued that the “only appropriate sentence” would be 50 years.</p><p>Mr. Bateman’s lawyer, Brian F. Russo, did not immediately respond to a request for comment after the sentencing. He had asked the court for a 20-year sentence, arguing that it would allow his client to be treated and rehabilitated and that “anything over 20 years seems overly harsh and unnecessarily punitive.”</p><p>In a sentencing memorandum, Mr. Russo wrote that Mr. Bateman had been evaluated by a psychiatrist who “opined” that Mr. Bateman was “mentally ill” and “delusional.”</p><p>Nine of Mr. Bateman’s followers have pleaded guilty to charges related to the child sexual abuse conspiracy, prosecutors said. In October, two other followers were convicted by a federal jury in Phoenix.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Bateman started proclaiming himself to be a prophet of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 2019, prosecutors said. The sect is not part of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/the-manifesto-and-the-end-of-plural-marriage?lang=eng" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">officially disavowed</a> polygamy in 1890.</p><p>In 2019, most of the sect’s members still recognized their imprisoned leader, Warren S. Jeffs, as their prophet. Mr. Jeffs was given <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/us/10brfs-POLYGAMISTLE_BRF.html" title="">a life sentence in 2011</a> for sexually assaulting an underage follower. Federal prosecutors said Mr. Bateman had sought to capitalize on a leadership void within the sect.</p><p>In 2019 and 2020, Mr. Bateman began taking adult women and girls from his male followers and proclaiming them to be his “wives,” according to a plea agreement that he signed. He and his followers traveled to Nebraska, Utah, and Colorado, where they collected “wives” and child “brides” and took them back to Colorado City, according to the plea agreement. None of them were legal marriages, prosecutors said.</p><p>During one of many “sacred ordinances” Mr. Bateman organized, he allowed other men to rape his “wives” and one of his 13-year-old child “brides” while he watched and raped another young girl, prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Samuel Bateman, the leader of a small polygamous group near the Arizona-Utah border.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Coconino County Sheriff&#39;s Officer, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Bateman “treated his child ‘brides’ like chattel and controlled every aspect of their lives,” federal prosecutors wrote in the sentencing memorandum. “He traded them with other men: he literally gave them away and took them back as he pleased. He paraded them around town on a flatbed trailer. He would have them sing to him every night, prepare his meals and drinks, and draw his bath for him.”</p><p>The fallout for his victims “could not be more tragic,” prosecutors wrote. One of his victims, who was 14, wrote to the court that Mr. Bateman had “harmed every part of her life: he stripped her of her identity — including her personality, dreams, and ambitions — and she lost her education, self-confidence, and many of her family relationships,” prosecutors wrote.</p><p>Alexandra E.
