    <h1>Hard-Right Freedom Caucus Takes Power in Wyoming</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>As state legislatures around the country prepare to convene next month, Wyoming is wading into uncharted political waters: For the first time anywhere in the country, the hard-right Freedom Caucus has won control of a State House.</p><p>After ousting a slew of Republican incumbents they viewed as too liberal in a caustic primary, and then galloping to victory in November, members of the ultraconservative caucus hope to cement their meteoric climb to power by passing five priority bills in the first 10 days.</p><p>Their agenda, known as the <a href="https://wyfreedomcaucus.com/our-plan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Five and Dime Plan</a>, aims to immediately tighten election rules, invalidate drivers’ licenses issued to undocumented immigrants by other states, prohibit college diversity initiatives, prohibit the state from considering environmental concerns when making investment decisions and reduce property taxes.</p><p>“We’re going to unwoke the state,” Representative Jeremy Haroldson, the next speaker pro tem, said. Members chose Representative Chip Neiman, also of the Freedom Caucus, as House speaker.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>These are heady days for ultraconservatives in Wyoming and beyond who have zealously challenged establishment Republicans and embraced the Freedom Caucus label.</p><p>What started in Washington in 2015 as a Congressional bloc, led by provocateurs like Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, has radiated into the states, inspiring similar movements in a dozen legislatures, including in Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Idaho and Arizona. In Texas, the House speaker, Dade Phelan, a more traditional conservative, recently announced that he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/us/texas-house-speaker-dade-phelan.html" title="">forgo another term</a> in leadership, underscoring the movement’s surging statehouse might as President-elect Donald J. Trump prepares to return to power.</p><p>Wyoming is the first state where the Freedom Caucus has won control of a legislative chamber, and as such represents a laboratory, and a test, for governance. Mr. Neiman and his slate were all first elected in 2020, and when the session begins in January, more than a third of the State House will be freshmen — including some with no prior government experience.</p><p>In the State Senate, Freedom Caucus allies now hold two of the top three leadership positions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-3"><div><figcaption><span>State Representative Jeremy Haroldson, the incoming speaker pro tem, at top left. State Representative Chip Neiman, the incoming House speaker, at bottom right. </span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“This is all new territory,” said U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis, who joined U.S. Senator John Barrasso and U.S. Representative Harriet Hageman in Casper, Wyo., last month to congratulate their fellow Republicans on their legislative victories.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The success of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus is part and parcel of the whole American desire to look at the Constitution as the guiding document,” said Ms. Lummis, who served in the Wyoming House and Senate before becoming a <a href="https://www.congressionalaward.org/leadership/senator-cynthia-lummis/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">founding member of the House Freedom Caucus</a> in Washington. “To have the people more in control.”</p><p>As the first territory, in 1869, to give women the right to vote, and the first state, in 1924, to elect a female governor, Wyoming has long cultivated its own brand of pragmatic Cowboy State conservatism. As the nation’s least populous state, with 580,000 residents, Wyoming can feel like a “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-10-20/wyoming-election-liz-cheney-republican-party" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">small town with one long street</a>,” as Susan Stubson, a Republican lawyer and writer in Casper, put it. And though Republicans have dominated the legislature for decades, former Gov. Dave Freudenthal, a Democrat, served two terms, until 2011.</p><p>The political milieu began to change when conservatives in some states, hoping to emulate what was happening in Washington with the Tea Party and the House Freedom Caucus, sought to yank their party further to the right. That endeavor expanded with the <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2021/12/14/national-right-wing-state-level-freedom-caucus-launches-at-georgia-capitol/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">beginning of the State Freedom Caucus Network</a> in 2021, said Matthew Green, a professor of politics at the Catholic University of America, and the co-author of a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/state-politics-and-policy-quarterly/article/from-congress-to-the-states-explaining-the-emergence-and-membership-of-freedom-caucuses-in-state-legislatures/6D86C1B489FA7390D3E39C3261E80AD9" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new study</a> on Freedom Caucus membership in state legislatures.</p><p>By 2023, members of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, which <a href="https://wyofile.com/conservatives-form-freedom-caucus-to-challenge-house-gop/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">formed in late 2020</a>, were receiving <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2023/02/22/wyoming-legislature-divides-along-conservative-battle-lines/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">texts from the caucus instructing them on how to vote on bills</a>.
