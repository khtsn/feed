Cool artist enclaves soon attract restaurants and retail. That’s what has happened in Little River, where a local real estate developer began buying up the grid of gritty warehouses in the predominantly Haitian neighborhood. Gentrification may follow, but for now, the area blooms with tropical fauna and the kind of commerce that defines Miami as a hot spot.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/02/multimedia/new-miami-neighborhoods-01-bzcp/new-miami-neighborhoods-01-bzcp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/02/multimedia/new-miami-neighborhoods-01-bzcp/new-miami-neighborhoods-01-bzcp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/02/multimedia/new-miami-neighborhoods-01-bzcp/new-miami-neighborhoods-01-bzcp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A black building with the words Imperial Moto Cafe above the doorway is fronted by palm trees.
