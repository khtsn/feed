It involves chartered buses running from four satellite lots to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan or to stations of the PATH train in North Jersey, and it was scheduled to start on Monday.</p><p>Each bus carries about 100 passengers, compared with as many as 1,000 on a full train, Mr. Kolluri said. The buses will accommodate only about 20 percent of the 70,000 commuters who take trains into the city, he said.</p><p>Some displaced commuters are likely to switch to existing bus routes operated by NJ Transit and private carriers. Others may drive at least part of the way to the city, adding traffic to already congested roads.</p><h2 id="link-12614b64">What are other ways to get in and out of New York?</h2><p>On Monday, there are still other ways to enter and escape from New York, though it will cost more in money and time. You have options by land, sea and air:</p><ul><li><p>NJ Transit rail passes and tickets will be accepted on its buses.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.panynj.gov/path/en/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PATH subway trains</a> run by the Port Authority are functioning as usual from Newark, Jersey City and Hoboken. PATH is not honoring NJ Transit tickets, so riders will have to pay the normal $3 fare.</p></li><li><p>Drive if you dare. The peak-hour toll to enter New York by bridge or tunnel in a passenger car is $16.06. Tack on $9 if you enter the congestion pricing zone below 60th Street.</p></li><li><p>The private <a href="https://www.boxcar.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Boxcar</a> luxury bus runs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/nyregion/boxcar-bus-nj-transit-strike.html" title="">to and from 12 stops in northern New Jersey</a>.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Amtrak trains continue to run to Penn Station in Manhattan, but the cost is far higher than the NJ Transit commuter lines. There are stops in Trenton, Princeton Junction, New Brunswick, Metropark and Newark.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nywaterway.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New York Waterway</a> runs ferries from docks in northern New Jersey and South Amboy to the city.

Commuters must drive, catch a ferry or take a bus to rail stations on the other side of the Hudson River.</p></li></ul><h2 id="link-71534417">What led to the stoppage?</h2><p>Most threatened transit strikes do not materialize, but the tone of negotiations became harsh as the deadline neared.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Last week, Mr. Kolluri questioned the “mental health” of Thomas Haas, the general chairman of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, after the union’s members overwhelmingly rejected a previous agreement.</p><p>Mr. Kolluri and union officials had shaken hands on a deal that appeared to bridge the impasse more than a month ago.
