Trump’s rivals before eventually supporting him in the 2024 race, was tapped as Mr. Trump’s ambassador to Britain on Monday.</p><p>The selection of Mr. Stephens for the ambassadorship, a plum posting that often goes to one of the largest donors to presidential campaigns, was in part a nod to the American Opportunity Alliance, a big-money network of Republican donors in which Mr. Stephens plays a leadership role. Mr. Trump and the alliance had a tense relationship at times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/us/politics/trump-gop-donors.html" title="">over the course of his campaign</a>.</p><p>In 2016, Mr. Stephens, the chief executive of Stephens, Inc., an investment bank based in Little Rock, Ark., gave <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00603621/1066278/sa/ALL" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$2 million</a> to a group dedicated to stop Mr. Trump from winning the Republican presidential nomination. During the most recent election cycle, he backed other Republican presidential candidates, including Asa Hutchinson, Chris Christie, Mike Pence and Nikki Haley.</p><p>Beginning in April, after it became evident that Mr. Trump would be the Republican nominee, Mr. Stephens donated over $3 million to support his campaign, according to <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00825851/1812284//sa/11AI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">federal campaign finance reports</a>.
