A Russian missile destroyed her old apartment building. Her daughter and her granddaughter were killed in the city. Still, Ms. Matvienko, 66, would like to return.</p><p>But after comments by President Trump and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/ukraine-war-hegseth-nato.html" title="">his defense secretary</a> this week signaled that Ukraine would have to give up territory as part of a peace deal, she is worried that Mariupol will become part of Russia. And she is horrified.</p><p>“If a part of America were taken from them, I would like to see how they would react,” said Ms. Matvienko, one of about 4.6 million Ukrainians who have <a href="https://www.ioc.gov.ua/en/analytics/dashboard-vpo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fled their homes</a> in the occupied territories and Crimea to live elsewhere in Ukraine. “It’s like ripping off a man’s arm or leg and then saying, ‘Let it be as it is.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ukrainians who fled Russian-occupied areas being transported to a center for displaced people in April.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mauricio Lima for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Trump has promised to bring a quick end to the war, which was set off by Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor three years ago. This week, he and his defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, publicly handed Moscow two big trophies before peace negotiations even start, saying that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/ukraine-war-hegseth-nato.html" title="">Russia could keep</a> at least some of the Ukrainian territory it has captured and that Ukraine won’t be joining NATO anytime soon.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Russia has captured about 20 percent of Ukraine, including Crimea, which it seized in 2014. If the deal outlined by U.S. officials this week goes through, many people who have lost their homes in the war will have little chance, in all likelihood, of returning.</p><p>Going forward, there would in effect be two Ukraines: The one controlled by Kyiv, and a battered Russian satellite to the east, with many Ukrainian families divided between them.</p><p>“This chain of Trump’s statements is a chain of humiliation for people like me, people who believed that there was law and justice in the world,” said Anna Murlykina, a 50-year-old journalist who fled to Kyiv from Mariupol in 2022.</p><p>“When you live in a world that is crumbling under your feet,” she said, “the only thing that helps you survive is to believe in guidelines, in civilized democratic countries that uphold values. When countries like the United States cease to be pillars, there is nothing to hope for.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A destroyed Ukrainian recruiting office in the city of Zaporizhzhia in March. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Guttenfelder for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In explaining the American position, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said it was “unrealistic” to insist on a return to Ukraine’s old borders. That, he said, “will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.”</p><p>It is difficult to say how many people remain in the occupied territories. By <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-tymchasovo-okupovani/3878992-na-tot-zalisautsa-blizko-sesti-miljoniv-ukrainciv-iz-nih-15-miljona-diti.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one estimate</a>, there were some six million people living there as of last June, among them 1.5 million children.</p><p>Some villages have been bombed so heavily that they now resemble moonscapes. People complain about the lack of sewers, water, electricity and other public services, while schools aim to indoctrinate Ukrainian children with Russian ideology. </p><p>One woman in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/05/26/world/russia-ukraine-news/explosions-again-echo-over-russian-occupied-berdiansk-a-local-official-says?smid=url-share" title="">Berdiansk</a>, a seaport captured by Russia in 2022, said the city was slowly recovering, though few original residents remained. She said that she had not supported the Russian invasion, and that like others who stayed, she was just trying to live her life.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she is scared of retaliation, said it angered her that some people in Ukraine called those who stayed traitors. “We did not betray anyone,” she said. “We are living on our own land, in our own homes, and simply trying to survive in the circumstances we found ourselves in.”</p><p>Liubov, 64, who asked that only her first name be used because she fears the Russians, fled Melitopol in eastern Ukraine in 2022, moving to Zaporizhzhia — which is now near the front lines. She said she was worried about her son, who is fighting for the Ukrainian army.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Medics treating Ukrainian soldiers wounded at the front lines at a stabilization point in Donetsk oblast in August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“It’s naïve, I know, but I was really hoping for Trump,” Liubov said. “Everyone I knew said he was so unpredictable, maybe he was the man who would stop the war.”</p><p>Now she, like other eastern Ukrainians, wonders what the cost of peace might be for them.</p><p>“I used to fantasize about how I would return home to Melitopol, cleanse my house of these bastards, because they live there now,” Liubov said. “I’d plant new roses, because no one cares about the garden there, and probably many flowers are gone.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>For some families, the split is more than just geographical.</p><p>One 55-year-old woman, for instance, lives in Dnipro, on the side of Ukraine controlled by Kyiv, while two sons live on the other side of the front line. Her younger son, 20, is trapped in the family home in a village in Donetsk. She said she was not speaking to her older son, who has sided with Russia. </p><p>Ukraine’s government has long said that its goal is to restore its borders to where they were before Russia captured Crimea, but in recent months, President Volodymyr Zelensky has shifted his public stance. He now says that Ukraine might have to cede land to Russia temporarily in a peace agreement and then try to regain it later through diplomatic means. </p><p>Recent polls show that more Ukrainians, weary of the grinding war, are <a href="https://asiatimes.com/2024/09/ukrainians-increasingly-willing-to-cede-land-for-peace-survey/#" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">willing</a> to trade land for peace than ever before; in November, a Gallup poll said <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/653495/half-ukrainians-quick-negotiated-end-war.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than half</a> of respondents wanted a quick negotiated end to the war.</p><p>Under the Biden administration, the United States was Ukraine’s biggest backer. Mr. Trump and his team, however, are skeptical of U.S. involvement in the war.</p><p>Without the United States in its corner, it is unclear how Ukraine will be able to keep fighting, or what diplomatic avenues are available. If U.S. support stops, Europe and other allies might have to dramatically step up military aid. Already, the country is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/world/europe/ukraine-war-troops-draft-recruitment.html" title="">having difficulty recruiting new soldiers</a>. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers in Serebryanka Forest, Ukraine, in February.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Many Ukrainians in the occupied territories say they are afraid to speak, especially to family members elsewhere in Ukraine, worried that their phones are being monitored. When they do talk, like the 20-year-old man on the Russian side of the frontline and his mother in Dnipro, they opt for uncontroversial topics, like the forest or the weather.</p><p>Russian civilians have already moved into some occupied areas, lured by cheap mortgages and abandoned properties. Some brokers are actively recruiting Russian buyers for waterfront property in places like Mariupol and Crimea.</p><p>One woman in Crimea, who spoke anonymously because she feared retribution, said in an interview that she and her neighbors had adapted to Russian institutions. She said she had stayed in Crimea because she wanted to raise her children in her homeland, but there is little hope.</p><p>Many people are at an emotional low because of all the uncertainty, she said.<span>  </span>“I don’t understand what prospects I or my children have,” she said. “It’s incredibly discouraging.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Ms. Matvienko, the woman whose daughter and granddaughter were killed in Mariupol, gained some renown in Ukraine after fleeing that city by going back into Russian-controlled territory to reclaim her 10-year-old grandson, who had been wounded in the strike that killed his mother. </p><p>Her friends say that people have moved to Mariupol from the Russian republics, and tell her horror stories about life there now.</p><p>“They can come into any house, throw the owner out and take it,” Ms. Matvienko said. “They can seize your business, your car.” </p><p>“There is absolute lawlessness,&#34; she added, “no one to complain to, no one to restore order.”</p><p>One friend, whom she used to chat with frequently on a social-media channel, has gone silent, she said.
