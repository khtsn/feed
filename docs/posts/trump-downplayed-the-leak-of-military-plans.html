    <h1>Trump Downplayed the Leak of Military Plans</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Trump told reporters today that the disclosure of internal national security deliberations on a commercial messaging app <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/us/politics/trump-signal-leak-war-plans.html" title="">was a minor transgression</a>. He characterized the extraordinary security breach as “just something that can happen.”</p><p>Trump also stood by his national security adviser, Michael Waltz, who had inadvertently added a journalist to a group chat with other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/us/signal-group-chat-key-figures.html" title="">members of the president’s inner circle</a>. In the chat, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and others shared information on timing, targets and weapons systems to be used in an attack on Houthi militants in Yemen. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/us/politics/war-plans-signal-chat-what-to-know.html" title="">Here’s what to know about it</a>.</p><p>During a Senate hearing this morning, the nation’s top two spy chiefs — who were both in the chat — acknowledged the sensitivity of information shared, but rejected responsibility. The administration claimed that nothing classified was shared; the journalist who was included in the chat said “they are wrong.”</p><p>Either way, disclosing even nonclassified national defense information in a nonsecure setting — like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/technology/signal-app-security-leak.html" title="">the app that was used, Signal</a> — can still violate the 1917 Espionage Act.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The port of Odessa, Ukraine, last week. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Oksana Parafeniuk for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-137c3129">Ukraine and Russia agreed to stop fighting in the Black Sea</h2><p>The Trump administration announced today that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/world/europe/russia-ukraine-deal-black-sea.html" title="">it had helped broker a maritime cease-fire</a>, in which both Ukraine and Russia would halt fighting in the Black Sea. Both countries confirmed the agreement, a significant step in the three-year war, but still far short of the permanent truce that Trump has been pushing for.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The deal, which came after three days of negotiations in Saudi Arabia, appeared to extract no major concessions from Russia, which started the war. The Kremlin said it would honor the maritime truce only after restrictions on Russian agricultural exports were removed — a demand the White House appeared to agree to, at least in part.</p><p><strong>In other news from Ukraine, </strong>a cheap drone <a href="https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/cI_nHcnzr_FOFvY07cWCcw~~/AAAAARA~/9RythDCnqd3oVGBSHUkFg0Wh_OOdRLM3wN8Bb5ajRXX58Gbwm0y2mEpieaBD-0PQNFVKvKr6i-BmlXn_kUCvtKt6ZU8a0S4YcpB5UKuBM2nKGrWLv9quF2_mTKV2pn7KaZ8vP6CWwOnNV_ljwL6bNoXKW9c1Ii4ggGfyhduuEsXlVZiov7CGfMlqm7eGcbVZ4baoh83cii5S0CC5mlijWioYiZhM01J261PUB7RhIVemj6YYvGFMU1RrZI0QSW-7ULvwzCq6umSBhJCi2L4At6AONFqOnIpnirVzkivR7LjF9hrDNuyzrkHTAJrxmbhjxgqfwZMa7WJlwzIm7u9_XkqvxYx5pXSHsOrw1IENGHLsjseYCxItJQoDCNdcx8Gh" title="">punched a hole last month in Chernobyl’s 40,000-ton shield</a> — which had been intended to enclose the nuclear disaster site for a century.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Frank Bisignano, Trump’s pick to lead the Social Security Administration.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-51b6378e">The Social Security nominee vowed not to seek privatization</h2><p>Frank Bisignano, the Wall Street veteran being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/us/politics/social-security-frank-bisignano-confirmation.html" title="">considered to lead the Social Security Administration</a>, offered a “guarantee” at his Senate confirmation hearing today that he would not seek to privatize the program: “I’ve never thought about privatizing,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A hospital in West Texas.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Desiree Rios for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-6fac1d8">A Kennedy-backed remedy left some measles patients sicker</h2><p>Doctors in West Texas are seeing measles patients whose illnesses have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html" title="">complicated by an alternative therapy endorsed by vaccine skeptics</a>, including Robert F.
