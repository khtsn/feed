A Delta Air Lines pilot announced on a jet flying from New York to Paris that an extra passenger was on the flight, which the airline said was investigating.</p><p>A person went through security screening without incident but bypassed two identity and boarding pass verification stations to board the plane, a representative for the Transportation Security Administration said. Without saying which airports the flight departed from and arrived at, or naming the flight or the person, the representative referred questions to the Charles de Gaulle airport police in Paris.</p><p>Delta said in a statement that it was working with law enforcement and aviation authorities to investigate Flight 264. The flight departed New York’s Kennedy International Airport on Tuesday night, landing at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris the next day, according to flight trackers. Delta did not provide further details on what it was investigating.</p><p>The airport authorities in Paris said they could not share information about the passenger.</p><p>Rob Jackson, 38, was on Delta Flight 264, traveling to meet his friends in France. The flight felt completely normal, he said, until the aircraft began descending to Paris, and he could hear the flight attendants’ intercoms going off repeatedly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I fly a lot, and it was unusual for that to be happening just as we were landing,” Mr. Jackson said.</p><p>When the plane arrived at the gate, the seatbelt signs remained on for longer than usual, he said. After the crew’s routine announcements welcoming the passengers to Paris, the captain shared some unexpected news.</p><p>“We’re just waiting for the police to come on board,” the captain can be heard saying in a video that Mr. Jackson recorded on the plane. “They’ve directed us to keep everyone on the airplane until we sort out an extra passenger that’s on the plane.”</p><p>Minutes later, Mr. Jackson saw six or seven police officers enter the plane. He did not see the person they took off, but he said he overheard a flight attendant telling another crew member that a woman had been hopping from one lavatory to another throughout the flight without ever going to a seat. The flight, which is about seven hours, was full, Mr. Jackson added.</p><p>The plane remained parked at the gate for about 40 minutes, frustrating some passengers who had connecting flights, he said, until he heard other passengers saying: “She’s off.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>When asked about the incident, the Federal Bureau of Investigation referred questions to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates Kennedy International, and the Queens District Attorney’s office. Neither responded to requests for comment early Thursday.</p><p>Tuesday was the start of what officials expect to be the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/us/thanksgiving-travel-chicago-new-york.html" title="">busiest Thanksgiving travel week</a>. The T.S.A. said that it expected to screen 18.3 million travelers from Tuesday through Monday, which would be a 6 percent increase from last year.</p><p>Hank Sanders<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-yoon">More about John Yoon</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
