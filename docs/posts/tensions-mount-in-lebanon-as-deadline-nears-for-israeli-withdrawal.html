But his comments added to the uncertainty over whether Israel would remain in a handful of strategic points within Lebanese territory.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/Press-Release-View/Article/4067198/statement-on-cessation-of-hostilities-implementation-mechanism/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> released by U.S. Central Command, Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers — who chairs the U.S.-led cease-fire committee in Lebanon — said he was confident that Lebanon’s military would control “all population centers” in the country’s south once the deadline elapses for Israeli troops to withdraw next Tuesday.</p><p>But Mr. Jeffers’s phrasing left the window open for the continued presence of Israeli troops at five key points along the border. The Israeli plan was reportedly relayed to the Lebanese government this week by U.S. officials.</p><p>The speaker of Lebanon’s Parliament, Nabih Berri, said on Thursday that U.S. officials had told him that Israel intended to remain in five areas inside Lebanese territory, a plan that Mr. Berri said the Lebanese government had firmly rejected. Lebanon’s government has repeatedly said that Israel must completely withdraw from the country when the deadline for its pullout elapses on Feb. 18.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Under the terms of a 60-day <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-ceasefire.html" title="">cease-fire</a> deal signed in November that ended the deadliest war between Israel and Hezbollah in decades, Israeli troops were supposed to withdraw last month from Lebanon.</p><p>But they have not done so, and thousands of Lebanese still cannot return to border towns in the country’s south that are still occupied by the Israeli military. More than two dozen people were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/world/middleeast/lebanon-gaza-cease-fires.html" title="">killed by Israeli forces</a> last month when they tried to enter their southern towns and villages, according to the Lebanese government.</p><p>With the truce deal now extended until Feb. 18, many in Lebanon fear the prospect of another <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/2000/05/24/414751.html?pageNumber=1" title="">prolonged Israeli occupation</a>.</p><p>Israel’s strategic affairs minister, Ron Dermer, a close confidante of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-13/israel-will-retain-five-army-posts-in-lebanon-after-ceasefire-top-minister-says" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> this week that Israel planned to hold the five strategic high points until Lebanon complies with its cease-fire commitments.</p><p>Under the terms of the truce deal, Hezbollah must also withdraw from southern Lebanon and the Lebanese military must deploy there in force. But Israeli officials have repeatedly accused them of not upholding their end of the bargain.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The Lebanese military has deployed into several towns in southern Lebanon, but only after Israel’s military withdrew from them.
