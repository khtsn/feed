    <h1>Trump Says He Does Not Have Plans to Replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President-elect Donald J. Trump said he has no plans to fire the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, addressing an uncertainty that has been hanging over the politically independent central bank.</p><p>Mr. Trump said over the summer that he did not plan to fire Mr. Powell, but made that comment <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-trump-interview/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">somewhat conditional</a> on Mr. Powell doing “the right thing” — presumably lowering interest rates. He was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/donald-trump-says-he-won-t-fire-fed-chief-jerome-powell-226490949880" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more definitive</a> in a new interview with NBC, airing Sunday morning.</p><p>“No, I don’t think so. I don’t see it,” Trump said when asked if he would remove Mr. Powell, whose term as <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/people/jerome-h-powell" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">chair expires</a> in May 2026. “I think if I told him to, he would. But if I asked him to, he probably wouldn’t. But if I told him to, he would.”</p><p>Mr. Powell <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/jerome-powell-trump-fed.html" title="">has said</a> that he does not think that the president has the legal authority to remove him — a position many lawyers agree with, although the idea has never been tested in courts. Mr. Powell has also said that he would not leave the position if asked.</p></div></div>
