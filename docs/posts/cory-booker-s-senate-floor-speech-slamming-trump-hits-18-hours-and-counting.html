Grateful to be able to rise right now and speak. I just want to tell you what John Lewis said. It’s a quote so many people know. He said, ‘get in good trouble, necessary trouble.’ So tonight, I rise with the intention of getting in some good trouble. I rise with the intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able. In just 71 days, the President of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans’ safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy and even our aspirations as a people for — from our highest offices, a sense of common decency. These are not normal times in America. And they should not be treated as such. John Lewis, so many heroes before us, would say that this is the time to stand up, to speak up. This is the time to get in some good trouble, to get into necessary trouble.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/01/multimedia/01trump-news-booker-speech-tbkc/01trump-news-booker-speech-tbkc-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Senator Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, spoke for hours, criticizing the Trump administration’s policies on Social Security, education, health care and more.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><ul><li><time datetime="2025-04-01T15:23:21-04:00"><span>April 1, 2025</span><span>Updated <span>3:23 p.m. ET</span></span></time></li></ul></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Senator Cory Booker gave a marathon all-night speech on the Senate floor that stretched into Tuesday afternoon, in an hourslong effort to put a spotlight on what he called a “crisis” facing the United States because of the Trump administration’s “recklessness.”</p><p>Mr. Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, began speaking at 7 p.m. on Monday, and was still going at 2:30 p.m. Tuesday, laying into the Trump administration’s cuts to government services and its crackdown on immigrants.</p><p>“This is not right or left, it is right or wrong,” Mr. Booker said on Tuesday afternoon, his voice still strong. “This is not a partisan moment, it is a moral moment. Where do you stand?”</p><p>The speech, which by afternoon had moved within reach of the Senate record for the longest such speech, was part of an effort by Democrats to retake the initiative and more assertively oppose President Trump. Mr. Booker divided his remarks into sections focused on an aspect of the administration’s policies, including on health care, education, immigration and national security.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He assailed what he said were Mr. Trump’s plans to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/upshot/trump-medicaid-tax-cuts.html" title="">cut funding for Medicaid</a>, among other programs. The White House has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/fact-check-president-trump-will-always-protect-social-security-medicare/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denied</a> that it plans to cut Medicaid benefits, but the president and his allies have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/business/trump-debt-tax-us.html" title="">attacked Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security</a> over what they claim is waste, fraud and abuse.</p><p>“I rise with the intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able,” Mr. Booker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXdqHXbp04s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said near the start of his speech</a> on Monday. “I rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our nation is in crisis.”</p><p>As dawn broke, Mr. Booker, a former presidential candidate, declared he was “rip-roaring and ready” to continue.</p><p>“I’m wide-awake,” he said. “I’m going to stand here for as many hours as I can.”</p><p>Hovering over a lectern and often speaking in a booming voice, he paused several times to allow questions from fellow Democrats, including Senators Chuck Schumer of New York, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, and Raphael Warnock of Georgia, without formally relinquishing the floor. At points, Mr. Booker’s voice appeared to crack.</p><p>The speech was not a filibuster — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/13/us/politics/filibuster-senate-manchin-sinema.html" title="">a procedural tactic</a> that has been used to block legislation on many issues, including civil rights — because it did not come during a debate over a specific bill or nominee. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Before his speech, Mr. Booker <a href="https://x.com/CoryBooker/status/1906844166467764732" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a> that he was heading to the Senate floor because Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire who is one of the president’s top advisers, had shown what he called “a complete disregard for the rule of law, the Constitution and the needs of the American people.”</p><p>“In just 71 days, the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans’ safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy and even our aspirations as a people for — from our highest offices — a sense of common decency,” Mr. Booker said in his speech. “These are not normal times in America, and they should not be treated as such.”</p><p>Mr. Musk’s feed on X, his social media platform, was active late into the night on Monday, but it made no mention of Mr. Booker or his all-night speech. Neither did Mr. Trump’s Truth Social feed.</p><p>As viewers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2utlMxAwtE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">followed along</a> on Mr. Booker’s official YouTube channel, he quoted from celebrated speeches by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/us/john-lewis-dead.html" title="">Representative John Lewis</a> and Senator <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/25/obituaries/john-mccain-dead.html" title="">John McCain</a>, both of whom have died. At one point, he spent around 30 minutes reading an account by a Canadian citizen, Jasmine Mooney, about her detention in the United States by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/mooney-canadian-american-pie-actress-ice.html" title="">immigration enforcement</a> officers.</p><p>As the speech neared 20 hours, it moved within reach of some of the longest in Senate history.</p><p>Since 1915, many of the 48 all-night sessions in the chamber — defined as those lasting past 4 a.m. — have <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/AllNightSessions.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gone well over 24 hours</a>. Senator Ted Cruz’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/26/us/politics/senate-budget-battle.html" title="">verbal assault</a> on President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act in 2013 lasted 21 hours and 19 minutes. In 1957, Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina spoke against a voting rights act for 24 hours 18 minutes, considered the Senate’s longest filibuster.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-5"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mike Ives is a reporter for The Times based in Seoul, covering breaking news around the world.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mike-ives">More about Mike Ives</a></span></p></div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matthew-mpoke-bigg">More about Matthew Mpoke Bigg</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-senate">U.S. Senate</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/democratic-party">Democratic Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/cory-booker">Cory Booker</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Executive Order on Elections:</strong> Nearly every arm of the Democratic Party <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/us/politics/trump-executive-order-elections-lawsuit.html">united in filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration</a>, arguing that a recent executive order seeking to require documentary proof of citizenship and other voting reforms is unconstitutional.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fitness Standards for Combat Roles:</strong> Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, mandated that physical fitness requirements for combat jobs be “sex-neutral,” a move that is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/us/politics/hegseth-fitness-standards-military-combat-roles.html">likely to significantly reduce the number of women who qualify</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>‘Move It Back to the States’:</strong> President Trump justifies his plan to shutter the Education Department by saying that states should control schools. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/trumps-education-back-to-the-states.html">He’s using the mantra for other policies, too</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong> Immigration Law and Congressional Limits:</strong> A crackdown targeting foreign students protesting Israel’s treatment of Palestinians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/trump-deportations-students-campus-protests.html">conflicts with free-speech protections</a> that lawmakers added in 1990.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Next Law Firm Target:</strong> The law firm that employs Doug Emhoff, former Vice President Kamala Harris’s husband, has learned that it is among the next firms that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/trump-law-firm-doug-emhoff-wilkie-farr-gallagher.html">Trump plans to use his power to punish</a>, according to four people briefed on the matter.</p></li><li><p><strong>Targeting Federal Agencies:</strong> The so-called Department of Government Efficiency, led by billionaire Elon Musk, has appeared at agency after agency to slash spending and cut the federal work force. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/27/us/politics/doge-playbook-musk-cuts.html">Here’s how DOGE employees do it</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.A.I.D.:</strong> The Trump administration detailed its plans to put the government’s main agency for distributing foreign aid fully under the State Department and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/usaid-trump-doge-cuts.html">reduce its staff to some 15 legally required positions</a>.
