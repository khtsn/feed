Al Aqsa, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/10/world/middleeast/aqsa-mosque-jerusalem.html" title="">sits atop an ancient plateau in Jerusalem</a> that is sacred to Jews and Muslims, has long been a point of contention.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>For decades, Israel’s government prevented Jews from praying on the grounds to avoid stoking tensions, and officially, it still does so.
