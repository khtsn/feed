Kennedy Jr.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The department has hired a discredited vaccine skeptic to research a link, long debunked by scientists, between vaccines and autism. On Friday, the nation’s top vaccine regulator resigned, citing Mr. Kennedy’s “misinformation and lies.”</p><p>In recent weeks, members of the National Academy of Medicine, a nonprofit organization that provides independent health policy advice, began discussing their concerns with members of the national academies of sciences and engineering.</p><p>Those conversations gave rise to the open letter, said Dr. Steven Woolf, an organizer of the letter who studies health policy at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p><p>The letter was drafted by a group of 13 scientists representing fields like medicine, climate science, sociology and economics.</p><p>“I know what this is going to do to life expectancy in the United States, to mortality rates, to the mental health crisis we’re having,” Dr. Woolf said. “These changes in the research enterprise are going to translate into harms to everyday Americans.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Dr. Woolf cited, for example, the planned restructuring of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, a small agency charged with protecting patient safety and guaranteeing Americans access to free preventive services like mammograms.</p><p>“The agency responsible for protecting the quality of health care in the United States just got demolished,” Dr. Woolf said.</p><p>The letter outlines the consequences of funding cuts, including pauses on research studies, faculty layoffs and reduced graduate student enrollments.</p><p>It also accuses the administration of “engaging in censorship” by, among other things, “blocking research on topics it finds objectionable, such as climate change, or that yields results it does not like, on topics ranging from vaccine safety to economic trends.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Benjamin Mueller reports on health and medicine.
