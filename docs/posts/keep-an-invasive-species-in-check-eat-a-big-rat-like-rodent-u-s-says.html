The agency noted in its <a href="https://www.fws.gov/story/2025-02/eat-invaders" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public advisory</a> that hunting nutrias is not a total solution but is a start.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“OK, so how can we help?” the Feb. 20 advisory said. “Nutria gumbo. Their meat is lean, mild and tastes like rabbit.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nutrias can serve as a flavorful base for all sorts of dishes, according to Philippe Parola, a chef based in Baton Rouge, La.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">@lanutriarodeo</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Nutrias, which weigh 15 to 20 pounds, are increasingly found along the Gulf Coast, in the Pacific Northwest and in the Southeastern United States. Their exact population is unknown.</p><p>They are native to South America but were introduced to North America in the 19th century during the heyday of the fur trade, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p><p>A group of nutrias, called a colony, can disrupt ecosystems and farming operations by burrowing extensively and uprooting flora. The animal’s feeding habits can cause widespread erosion in wetland areas — like “something out of a disaster movie,” the Fish and Wildlife Service said on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1040728318097764" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Save a Swamp, Sauté a Nutria,” the agency added.</p><p>Nutrias can serve as a flavorful base for all sorts of dishes, according to Philippe Parola, a chef based in Baton Rouge, La., and the author of <a href="https://www.cantbeatemeatem.us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Can’t Beat ’Em, Eat ’Em,”</a> a cookbook with recipes for 40 invasive species, including nutrias.</p><p>“It was crockpot nutria,” Mr. Parola said. “You get the hind and you put it in a crockpot — vegetable, beef broth, tomato paste. And you get the perfect stew.”</p><p>As long as the meat is cleaned after hunting, cooking nutria is like preparing any wild game, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Participants at the annual Louisiana Nutria Rodeo arrive with truckloads of the dead rodents.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">@lanutriarodeo</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The community of Venice, La., situated at the end of the Mississippi River, hosts the annual Louisiana Nutria Rodeo.

But he hoped that nutria dishes could be commercialized and prepared more often, rather than just as a novelty.</p><p>He said he once cooked a 20-gallon nutria gumbo at the rodeo for attendees to sample.</p><p>“It was gone in no time,” he said.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
