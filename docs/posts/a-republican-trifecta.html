    <h1>A Republican Trifecta</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Republicans moved closer to claiming House control yesterday. They have won <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/06/us/elections/results-house-races-tracker.html" title="">214 of the 218 seats they need for a majority</a>, and 16 races remain uncalled. With the House, Republicans would have full control of the federal government next year.</p><p>Donald Trump and his allies have carefully planned for this moment.</p><p>Today’s newsletter is the first in a series called “Trump’s Agenda,” which will look at what Republicans aim to get done. This first installment is akin to a table of contents. Future newsletters will go into more detail in the coming months.</p><h2 id="link-2c4ff2fe">The likely changes</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Donald Trump at the southern border in August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>There are four areas in which a Republican Congress is most likely to make policy changes. For three of them, the party seems mostly united, and legislation does not necessarily have to overcome a filibuster in the Senate. (Some budget bills can pass with a simple majority.) For the last — aid to Ukraine — enough Republicans oppose a bill to keep it from becoming law.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>1. Tax cuts:</strong> The signature legislation Trump signed in his first term was a 2017 law that cut taxes for almost all Americans, but especially the wealthy and corporations. Many of those cuts expire next year, and a Republican Congress is almost certain to extend most of them.</p><p>The biggest question is whether Congress will cut taxes even more, as Trump has said he favors (on tips, for example). That would make an already expensive tax bill even more costly — and lawmakers who are worried about the federal debt, including some Republicans, might oppose it.</p><p><strong>2. Immigration:</strong> Nothing animated Trump on the campaign trail like immigration. He has promised mass deportations, which he could start by himself with executive action. But fully executing his plans will require money from Congress — for example, to hire border agents and build more of the wall.</p><p>Bigger changes to the immigration system would require bipartisan support to overcome a filibuster. Democrats have backed stricter entry rules before, but they might refuse to work with Trump on his signature issue. Some of Trump’s wealthy supporters have also pushed him to allow more <em>legal</em> immigration, but it’s unclear if Congress would agree.</p><p><strong>3. Energy and climate: </strong>Congressional Republicans will probably reduce clean-energy funding, and Trump can unilaterally permit more oil and gas drilling and cut environmental regulations. Those moves will likely worsen climate change, but Republicans hope they will reduce energy costs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>There may also be opportunities for bipartisan legislating. Lawmakers from both parties want to streamline the permitting process, which could help oil, gas and clean energy projects move forward.</p><p><strong>4. Ukraine:</strong> Trump and many congressional Republicans are skeptical about providing more aid for Ukraine’s defense against Russia. The aid approved earlier this year will probably run out sometime in 2025, at which point Ukraine’s struggles on the battlefield will grow.</p><h2 id="link-2e20c3b8">The maybes</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shipping containers in Baltimore. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>At least three other parts of Trump’s agenda are more uncertain. Either Republicans are more divided on the issue or the change would require 60 Senate votes to overcome a filibuster. (Republicans are likely to have only 52 or 53.)</p><p><strong>1. Tariffs:</strong> Trump campaigned on large tariffs — effectively sales taxes on foreign goods — to resurrect American manufacturing and to raise revenue. But some Republicans and business leaders are opposed. Tariffs historically mean higher prices, and they could lead other countries to retaliate with their own penalties on American products. Trump could try to impose tariffs unilaterally, but such a move would be vulnerable to legal challenges.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>2. The safety net:</strong> Republicans have suggested they will balance budgets by cutting some government spending. They might let Obamacare health insurance subsidies expire next year, which would increase the number of uninsured people. Republicans also appear poised to slash Medicaid, food stamps and other programs that help poor and disabled Americans.</p><p><strong>3. Voter ID:</strong> Republicans want to pass legislation requiring ID to register and vote, but they will need some Democratic support to pass it in the Senate. Republicans falsely claim that Democrats register undocumented immigrants and that elections are rigged. Still, such a law wouldn’t be unusual for a democracy; many other countries require ID.</p><p>(What about abortion? Republicans seem unlikely to pass nationwide abortion restrictions. Trump has distanced himself from a potential ban, and passing one would require eliminating the filibuster.)</p><h2 id="link-40712438">Potential opposition</h2><p>Democrats’ best hope for slowing this agenda involves public opinion. Some parts of the Republican agenda, like cuts to the safety net, are unpopular. Public protests could lead to their demise, as happened with efforts to repeal Obamacare in Trump’s first term.</p><p>Republicans also have their own disagreements, particularly between the old guard and the MAGA wing. The MAGA wing is more favorable to tariffs, immigration restrictions and cutting off aid to Ukraine. The old guard includes business-friendly Republicans who are more committed to free trade, more legal immigration and a foreign policy that stands up to Russia. With few votes to lose and higher stakes, the infighting could get worse, said our colleague Catie Edmondson, who covers Congress.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Ultimately, Republicans’ ability to realize their agenda may rest on how well they get along.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> Most of the undecided House races are in California. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/california-ballot-count-house-election.html" title="">The state is very slow to count ballots</a>.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-639426da">Trump Appointments</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Marco Rubio</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><ul><li><p>Trump is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-rubio-secretary-of-state.html" title="">expected to name Senator Marco Rubio</a> as secretary of state.
