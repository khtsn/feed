data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>More than two dozen F.B.I. informants were in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, but, contrary to widespread conspiracy theories, bureau officials did not instruct them to encourage anyone to break the law as a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol that day, according to a report by a Justice Department watchdog released on Thursday.</p><p>After a four-year investigation, the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, determined that F.B.I. leaders acted appropriately by dispatching some of the informants to monitor subjects related to the Capitol attack, and that the bureau shared the limited intelligence it had with other law enforcement agencies.</p><p>But the inspector general also criticized the bureau’s leaders for failing to recognize the potential dangers posed by the rioters — and for failing to follow through on its promise to canvass its field offices for intelligence on potential threats after the 2020 election.</p><p>Three of the informants had been sent to Washington on Jan. 6 “tasked by F.B.I. field offices to report on specific domestic terrorism case subjects,” the report found. One of them actually entered the Capitol during the riot, and the other two breached the “restricted area” around the building, investigators found.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But their reports were of limited of use and “no more specific” than other sources of information.</p><p>More than 20 other informants who had a history of working with the F.B.I. were in Washington that day and attended events related to Jan. 6, but went to them on their own volition, not at the bureau’s request, the report found.</p><p>The report found no evidence that any undercover F.B.I. agents were present in the crowd that gathered to disrupt the certification of President Biden’s electoral victory against Donald J. Trump in the 2020 election.</p><p>The fact that there were F.B.I. informants in the crowd at the Capitol on Jan. 6 has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/25/us/politics/capitol-riot-fbi-informant.html" title="">long been known</a>: At least one person embedded in the Proud Boys, one of the far-right extremist groups central to the effort of violently obstructing the peaceful transfer of power, texted real-time updates to his F.B.I. handlers who appeared to be caught by surprise as the riot unfolded.</p><p>But Mr. Horowitz’s report pushed back on allegations that the presence of informants was an indication that the F.B.I. had any role in causing or guiding the Capitol attack. None of the informants were authorized to enter the Capitol, according to the report, or was directed by the F.B.I. to encourage others to commit illegal acts.</p><p>The report was issued as the investigative efforts surrounding Jan. 6 could soon be on the wane.</p><p>Almost 1,600 people have been charged so far in connection with the riot in the largest inquiry the Justice Department has ever undertaken. But Mr. Trump has promised to pardon some or all of the defendants and the future of the broader investigation remains unclear.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The separate criminal prosecution of Mr. Trump for his role in inspiring the attack is also dead, and the Trump-appointed F.B.I. director who oversaw the bureau’s actions that day announced he intended to step down one day earlier.</p><p>The Justice Department commissioned Mr. Horowitz’s review in the days after the attack to examine flaws in the run-up to the riot and the response of federal law enforcement. Mr. Horowitz said he was forced to delay his investigation for years in deference to federal criminal investigations — then waited several more months to release it after the election.</p><p>Internal bureau alerts, <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/internal-briefings-reveal-fbis-real-time-reaction-to-jan-6/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made public earlier this year</a>, showed that bureau officials initially believed the pro-Trump gathering would be peaceful, if raucous, but that their view of the situation changed sharply as the day progressed and the protesters became increasingly violent.</p><p>But the F.B.I.’s activities that day have been somewhat shrouded in mystery, in part because F.B.I. officials and agents were reluctant to testify about the bureau’s intelligence failures to the House committee that investigated the attack.</p><p>Almost from the outset, right-wing conspiracy theorists filled the information void, with rumor, conjecture and, in some cases, conspiracy theories. Many argued, without providing evidence, that provocateurs working for the government purposefully goaded members of the mob into attacking the Capitol as a way to discredit Mr. Trump and his supporters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But no Jan. 6 defendant has successfully argued entrapment as a defense in court. Even a lawyer for a Proud Boys leader charged with seditious conspiracy in connection with the attack, stood up in court last year and called that theory “slander.”</p><p>Representative Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican known for making wild claims, has attempted to shift blame from Mr. Trump and his supporters to the federal government by accusing the F.B.I. of inciting the riot, saying it brought in “ghost buses” full of provocateurs.</p><p>“The original seeds of riotous or illegal or occupation behavior among these groups were planted by the F.B.I.-embedded agents in those groups,” Mr. Higgins said.</p><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/us/politics/trump-tweet-jan-6.html" title="">did call for supporters to amass in Washington</a> on Jan. 6, telling them, “Be there, will be wild!”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Glenn Thrush covers the Department of Justice and has also written about gun violence, civil rights and conditions in the country’s jails and prisons.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush">More about Glenn Thrush</a></span></p></div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
