The memories we shared with him will be treasured forever.”</p><p>Tomlinson and Malik posted emotional tributes of their own a day after Payne died.</p><p>“Liam was somebody I looked up to everyday, such a positive, funny, and kind soul,” Tomlinson wrote in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBPRBySzeJW/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a lengthy post</a> that was accompanied by a photo of Payne and him smiling together onstage. “And for the record, Liam was in my opinion the most vital part of One Direction. His experience from a young age, his perfect pitch, his stage presence, his gift for writing. The list goes on.”</p><p>Tomlinson then pivoted to addressing Payne directly, writing, “If you’re listening, I feel beyond lucky to have had you in my life, but I’m really struggling with the idea of saying goodbye.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBPVN-8vDN9/?hl=en&amp;img_index=2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Malik posted</a> a photo of himself and Payne, both much younger and asleep in a car with Malik’s head on Payne’s lap.</p><p>“Liam, I have found myself talking out loud to you, hoping you can hear me, I can’t help but think selfishly that there was so many more conversations for us to have in our lives,” Malik wrote, thanking Payne for his guidance throughout their time together.</p><p>“I knew nothing in comparison, I was a novice child with no experience, and you were already a professional,” he wrote. “There is no words that justify or explain how I feel right now other than beyond devastated.”</p><p>Payne’s family also released a statement on Thursday, asking for privacy. “We are heartbroken,” the family said. “Liam will forever live in our hearts and we’ll remember him for his kind, funny and brave soul.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Payne first auditioned on the British talent show “The X Factor” as a solo artist in 2008, and found success with One Direction when he returned to the program in 2010.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeff Spicer/Getty Images for Atlantis The Royal</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Payne first auditioned on the British talent show “The X Factor” as a solo artist in 2008 and found success when he returned in 2010. Simon Cowell, the music executive and television personality, brought Payne together with Styles, Horan, Malik and Tomlinson to compete as a group, which eventually became One Direction, one of the defining boy bands of the early 2010s.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The group would release five albums and have 29 total hits on Billboard’s Hot 100. In 2015, the members <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/24/one-direction-says-it-is-taking-a-break-but-not-splitting-up/" title="">announced that they would take a break</a> performing as an ensemble to focus on their solo careers. But in 2016, it was reported that <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/one-direction-is-splitting-hiatus-to-become-a-permanent-break-w161510/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the band had split for good</a>.</p><p>“We are heartbroken by the sad passing of Liam Payne,” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBOCDCSo-t3/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">read a post</a> on the talent show’s official social media accounts on Thursday. “He was immensely talented and, as part of One Direction, Liam will leave a lasting legacy on the music industry and fans around the world.”</p><p>On Wednesday evening, fans had gathered and sung One Direction hits outside the CasaSur Palermo Hotel in Buenos Aires, where Payne had been staying when he died. Alejandra Hernández, 21, clutched a bouquet of white flowers as she stood weeping among dozens of fans.</p><p>“I grew up listening to One Direction,” she said, her voice trembling. “It meant so much to me.”</p><p>After Payne’s body was taken away in a fire truck, Mia Elsner, 18, cried inconsolably. “This tears me apart,” she said. “His music was warm and uplifting; he was different from other artists.”</p><p>Elsner said she was trying to avoid social media, where theories about Payne’s death were circulating. “I’m going to skip his songs on my playlists for a while,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Camila Martínez, 24, was working in a nearby clothing store when she heard that Payne had died. She quickly asked two friends to join her in mourning.</p><p>“He was my favorite,” Martínez said. “My heart shattered when the band split. My life was tough, and I’d turn to their music whenever I felt sad.”</p><p>“I’m still waiting to hear this is all a lie,” she added.</p><p>Some pop music stars, including Rita Ora and Charlie Puth, shared their memories of Payne on social media after his death.</p><p>“I’m devastated,” Ora wrote, sharing <a href="https://x.com/RitaOra/status/1846894272345526331" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a black-and-white photo</a> of her working with Payne in which he is resting his head on her shoulder. “He had the kindest soul, I will never forget. I loved working with him so much — he was just such a joy to be around on and off stage.”</p><p>She added: “Our song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtT3qs96yb0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">For You</a> takes on a whole new meaning for me now.
