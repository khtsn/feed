The plan, which the president laid out last night, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/world/europe/trump-gaza-explainer.html" title="">sharply criticized by allies and adversaries alike</a>.</p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio twice suggested today that Trump was proposing only to clear out and rebuild Gaza, not to take it over. The president’s envoy to the Middle East said at a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill that Trump “doesn’t want to put any U.S. troops on the ground, and he doesn’t want to spend any U.S. dollars at all” on Gaza, according to a senator.</p><p>Those comments were a notable departure from the plans that Trump detailed last night at a news conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. The president said that he intended to “take over” Gaza, using American troops if necessary, and that he would turn it into the “Riviera of the Middle East.” He also described the Palestinian relocation as permanent.</p><p>Trump’s Gaza plans were met with swift opposition around the world. Leaders of Egypt and Jordan, where the president said Palestinians should be moved, dismissed the plan. So did representatives of France and Russia. Gazans expressed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/world/middleeast/gaza-trump-takeover-palestinians.html" title="">condemnation and confusion</a>. Experts called Trump’s proposal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/world/middleeast/trump-gaza-takeover-illegal.html" title="">a breach of international law</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>John Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director, during his swearing-in ceremony last month. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-4cc0abf">What the Army pilots could see, just before the crash</h2><p>It is not yet clear what caused a deadly crash last week between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines passenger jet near Washington.

Egg prices are sky high at many grocery stores and Waffle House announced yesterday that it planned to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/business/waffle-house-egg-surcharge.html" title="">charge customers an extra 50 cents for each egg</a>.</p><p>The spread has caused people to ask if <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/well/eggs-bird-flu.html" title="">eggs are still safe to eat</a>, so we asked several experts.
