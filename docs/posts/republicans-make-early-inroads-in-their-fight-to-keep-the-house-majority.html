    <h1>Republicans Make Early Inroads in Their Fight to Keep the House Majority</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>But the party appeared to collapse in Pennsylvania, in an early indication of the difficulty that even battle-tested incumbents were facing trying to outrun Vice President Kamala Harris in a state where Mr. Trump emerged triumphant. Republicans were set to oust Representative Matt Cartwright, who has held his Scranton-based seat since 2013 and has long defied political gravity in his conservative-leaning district. They were also set to flip the Lehigh Valley district that Representative Susan Wild won in 2018. Both Democrats conceded defeat on Wednesday, even before the final results were known.</p><p>And Democrats failed to make inroads in a number of critical districts that the party needed to win to wrest back control of the House, as voters nationwide registered their unhappiness with the Biden-Harris administration, setting up Mr. Trump to become the first Republican to win the national popular vote since 2004.</p><p>Republicans held on to four seats that Democrats had targeted, in New York, New Jersey, Wisconsin and Iowa. And they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/elections/michigan-house-barrett-hertel.html" title="">flipped a crucial seat in Central Michigan</a>, the Lansing-based district formerly held by Representative Elissa Slotkin, the Democrat who ran for Senate.</p><p>“This historic election has proven that a majority of Americans are eager for secure borders, lower costs, peace through strength and a return to common sense,” Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement on Wednesday. “As more results come in, it is clear that, as we have predicted all along, Republicans are poised to have unified government in the White House, Senate and House.”</p><p>Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, publicly held out hope that his party could still prevail.</p></div></div>
