She was 31.</p><p>Her death <a href="https://www.zdfheute.de/panorama/prominente/laura-dahlmeier-verunglueckt-pakistan-100.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was reported by ZDF</a>, a German broadcaster that had employed her as an expert biathlon commentator, and confirmed by Pakistani officials.</p><p>The accident occurred around noon on Monday, at an altitude of about 18,000 feet at Laila Peak in the Karakoram Mountains in the Hushe Valley region of northeast Pakistan, said Karrar Haidri, an official at the Alpine Club of Pakistan, a group that promotes mountaineering. Faizullah Firaq, a spokesman for the regional government of Gilgit-Baltistan, confirmed the death.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Ms. Dahlmeier, an experienced mountaineer who had been climbing in the area since June, was hit by falling rocks.

A multinational team of six with the support of the Pakistani military began a joint operation on Wednesday to reach Ms. Dahlmeier. They reached the location of the body and visually confirmed her identity, Mr. Firaq said. “Efforts are currently underway to retrieve it and transport it back to base camp,” he said.</p><p>Ms. Dahlmeier won the sprint and pursuit events in biathlon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/sports/olympics/winter-games.html" title="">at the 2018 Winter Games</a> in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and added a bronze in the individual event. In Germany, she had helped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/sports/olympics/popular-events.html" title="">boost the popularity</a> of the biathlon, a cross-country ski race in which participants also shoot at targets. She won five gold medals at the 2017 world championships in Hochfilzen, Austria, among a total of seven in her career.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But she left the sport in 2019 at age 25, <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/biathlon-double-olympic-champion-dahlmeier-retires-25-120809523--spt.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying</a>, “I no longer feel the 100 percent passion that is needed for professional sports.”</p><p>In retirement, in addition to mountain climbing, she participated in mountain-running races.</p><p>“Laura Dahlmeier was an exceptional athlete whose international successes in biathlon fascinated and thrilled not only winter sports fans,” Germany’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, <a href="https://www.bundespraesident.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/DE/2025/07/250730-Kondolenz-Dahlmeier.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>. “I was fortunate enough to be there as a spectator when she won her first Olympic gold medal at the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea. Back then in Pyeongchang, she impressed not only with her athletic performance and nerves of steel, but also with her personality, with her likable, open and passionate manner.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Victor Mather, who has been a reporter and editor at The Times for 25 years, covers sports and breaking news.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
