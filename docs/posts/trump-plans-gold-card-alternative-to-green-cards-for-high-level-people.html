The price tag, he said, would be about $5 million.</p><p>Mr. Trump revealed his gold card plan to reporters in the Oval Office, where he was signing his latest round of executive orders, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/trump-tariffs-copper.html" title="">one related to tariffs on copper imports</a>. His commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, filled in some of the details.</p><p>Mr. Lutnick explained that “the Trump gold card,” as he called it, would replace the EB-5 visa program, which similarly provides a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/us/politics/program-that-lets-foreigners-write-a-check-and-get-a-visa-draws-scrutiny.html" title="">pathway to citizenship for wealthy foreign investor types</a> but has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/12/us/politics/visa-program-up-for-renewal-amid-allegations-of-fraud.html" title="">an avenue for fraud</a>. Mr. Lutnick implied that the administration would be more discerning as to who might qualify for a gold card, though details were scant at this early stage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We’re going to make sure they’re wonderful world-class global citizens,” Mr. Lutnick said.</p><p>Mr. Trump added, “It will be people with money and people that create jobs.”</p><p>Asked whether a Russian oligarch might be eligible for a gold card, Mr. Trump seemed amused. “Yeah,” he replied. “Possibly.”</p><p>He added, “Hey, I know some Russian oligarchs that are nice people. It’s possible.”</p><p>Mr. Lutnick began to chuckle as Mr. Trump continued, “They’re not as wealthy as they used to be.” Starting to laugh himself, the president added, “I think they can afford five million dollars.”</p><p>He predicted that the gold card program would be a moneymaker for the government, reasoning that many companies would pay the $5 million fee to bring in skilled workers.</p><p>“We’ll be able to sell maybe a million of these cards, maybe more than that,” Mr. Trump said. “If you add up the numbers, they’re pretty good.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Shawn McCreesh is a White House reporter for The Times covering the Trump administration.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/shawn-mccreesh">More about Shawn McCreesh</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Trump’s Deportation Plans: </strong>Deporting migrants to Central American countries removes many political and legal hurdles for the Trump administration. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/world/americas/central-america-panama-trump-deportation-migrants.html">How far can the practice go before these nations reach a breaking point</a>?</p></li><li><p><strong>Symbol of Migrant Crisis Will Close: </strong>Mayor Eric Adams announced that the Roosevelt Hotel, which has been used as a migrant shelter and nicknamed “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/21/nyregion/roosevelt-hotel-migrant-crisis.html">the new Ellis Island,</a>” will stop housing migrants by June, calling the closure a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/nyregion/roosevelt-hotel-migrant-shelter-closing.html">milestone in New York City’s response to the crisis</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Guantánamo Bay: </strong>The Trump administration has said little about the Venezuelan men who were transferred from Texas to the U.S. military base in Cuba. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/us/politics/migrant-mission-guantanamo-bay.html">Here’s what we know</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deported to Panama</strong><strong>: </strong>More than half of the migrants from Asian nations sent to the country by the U.S. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/deportations-migrants-panama.html">have agreed to return to their home countries</a>, Panama said.
