    <h1>Trump Plans ‘Gold Card’ Alternative to Green Cards for ‘High Level People’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“We’re going to make sure they’re wonderful world-class global citizens,” Mr. Lutnick said.</p><p>Mr. Trump added, “It will be people with money and people that create jobs.”</p><p>Asked whether a Russian oligarch might be eligible for a gold card, Mr. Trump seemed amused. “Yeah,” he replied. “Possibly.”</p><p>He added, “Hey, I know some Russian oligarchs that are nice people. It’s possible.”</p><p>Mr. Lutnick began to chuckle as Mr. Trump continued, “They’re not as wealthy as they used to be.” Starting to laugh himself, the president added, “I think they can afford five million dollars.”</p><p>He predicted that the gold card program would be a moneymaker for the government, reasoning that many companies would pay the $5 million fee to bring in skilled workers.</p><p>“We’ll be able to sell maybe a million of these cards, maybe more than that,” Mr. Trump said. “If you add up the numbers, they’re pretty good.”</p></div></div>
