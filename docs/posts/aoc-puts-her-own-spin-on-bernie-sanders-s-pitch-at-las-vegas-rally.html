the American left over the past decade, his speeches have the flavor of a sociology lesson. He rarely makes himself the main character.</p><p>Which is why it is striking how differently the young leader often seen as his successor, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, approaches politics.</p><p>As she kicked off a Western tour with Mr. Sanders on Thursday in North Las Vegas, Nev., she introduced herself by name — which he never does — and used her experience waitressing to explain her politics to a crowd of several thousand people.</p><p>“I don’t believe in health care, labor and human dignity because I’m a Marxist — I believe it because I was a waitress,” she said. “Because I worked double shifts to keep the lights on and because on my worst day, I know what it feels like to feel left behind. And I know that we don’t have to live like this.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Sanders, by contrast, delivered a version of the same speech he has given since before Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was born, railing against corporate greed. “Eat the rich,” someone yelled.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Unlike Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Mr. Sanders rarely injects his personal story, including his middle-class roots, into his speeches.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mikayla Whitmore for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The divergent styles illustrate how, after Mr. Sanders built a political movement by emphasizing inequality in America, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez brings a contemporary flourish to their shared progressive politics.</p><p>Mr. Sanders, 83, learned politics in the 1960s. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 35, has undertaken her political education in the Trump era.</p><p>For Mr. Sanders, his political story relies on making a cogent case about inequality at the macro level. Only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-2020-democrats.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;sgrp=g&amp;pvid=2B9AC26A-CB64-4932-AACE-67E6F81B4BF3" title="">rarely does he speak in detail</a> about his feelings, his middle-class upbringing or how he lost both parents by age 21. Instead, he rails against billionaires who squeeze workers and, now, run the federal government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The worst addiction in this country today is the greed of oligarchy,” he told supporters on Thursday. “They are like heroin addicts — they need more and more and more. And if they have to destroy Social Security and Medicaid to get what they want, that is what they will do.”</p><p>Ms. Ocasio-Cortez understands the power of placing herself in her audience’s shoes. On Thursday, she spoke of feeling helpless in the face of swirling personal and national chaos.</p><p>She even went a step further, borrowing a tactic patented by President Trump to portray a political attack on her as a broadside against her supporters.</p><p>Under a spring sun hot enough to disable cellphones, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez told a crowd dressed in vintage Sanders campaign gear about <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/tv/trump-adviser-mocks-aocs-bartender-past-you-were-in-a-bar-not-to-have-a-drink-but-to-serve-one/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent television appearance</a> by one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers. She recalled the lawyer describing her as a mere bartender without the sufficient life experience to have important input on national affairs.</p><p>Ms. Ocasio-Cortez declared that the slight against her intelligence was in fact a public dismissal of the brainpower of all working-class people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“She isn’t just talking about me here. She’s talking about you — she is talking about all of us,” she said. “Imagine what it means for our country that the president’s own lawyer cannot even conceive of a working-class person being intelligent simply because of the job that they have.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In a recent interview with The New York Times, Mr. Sanders declined to say whether inviting Ms. Ocasio-Cortez on tour with him represented a passing of the torch.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mikayla Whitmore for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>It was the kind of political skill that has many progressive Democrats ready to anoint her as the next leader of the left-wing political movement built by Mr. Sanders, who has mostly — but not totally — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/us/politics/bernie-sanders-iowa-trump.html" title="">ruled out running for president again in 2028</a>. Several attendees at the rally wore shirts or hats indicating that they were ready for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez to step up.</p><p>“You know, Biden waited way too long to pass the torch, right?” said Lorita Loftus, a retired postal worker from Henderson, Nev. “If that’s what is happening, it’s a wise move.”</p><p>Still, there are few topics Mr. Sanders wants to discuss less than his mortality or who might succeed him as the leader of the left.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In an interview with The New York Times this week, Mr. Sanders — who mentioned Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s name just once in his 42-minute speech on Thursday — declined to entertain discussion about whether inviting her on tour with him represented a passing of the torch.</p><p>“That’s inside-the-Beltway gossip,” he grumbled. “You got any better questions?”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Reid J.
