The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/20/business/economy/forced-labor-china-supply-chain.html" title="">reported in 2022</a> that Zijin Mining had links with labor transfer programs in Xinjiang.</p><p>The additions also include one of the world’s largest textile manufacturers, Huafu Fashion, and 25 of its subsidiaries. It’s not clear which retailers Huafu currently supplies, but H&amp;M <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/3101696/hm-cuts-ties-chinese-supplier-over-xinjiang-forced-labour" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previously said</a> that it had an indirect relationship with a mill belonging to Huafu Fashion and that it would cut those ties.</p><p>Companies in real estate, mining, solar and cotton production were also added to the list. Altogether, they bring the list to 144 entities.</p><p>The Biden administration sees the 2021 Uyghur forced labor law as an important part of its legacy in countering unfair trade practices and discouraging certain problematic trade with China. Since the law went into effect, other governments, including in Europe and Canada, have taken steps to halt imports of goods made with forced labor, including products from Xinjiang.</p><p>Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary, said that the additions demonstrate the administration’s “relentless fight against the cruelty of forced labor, our unwavering commitment to basic human rights, and our tireless defense of a free, fair, and competitive market.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It’s not clear what approach the Trump administration will take toward enforcing the law. But the law passed with bipartisan support, and Senator Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican whom President-elect Donald J. Trump has chosen to be his secretary of state, was its primary author. Mr. Rubio has been a strong proponent of severing supply chains that involve forced labor in China.</p><p>A Homeland Security official said the Biden administration had set up a robust pipeline of companies it was investigating and researching that the Trump administration could pursue.</p><p>Xinjiang produces significant amounts of the world’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/30/world/asia/china-xinjiang-muslims-labor.html" title="">cotton</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crezlw4y152o" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tomatoes</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/business/economy/china-solar-companies-forced-labor-xinjiang.html" title="">polysilicon</a>, which is used in solar panels and semiconductors. In recent years, companies making flooring, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/06/business/economy/global-car-supply-chains-xianjiang-forced-labor.html" title="">cars</a>, electronics and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/11/business/economy/us-ban-china-uyghur-labor.html" title="">seafood</a> have all discovered that they were sourcing products, parts or raw materials from Xinjiang.</p><p>Companies have increasingly attracted censure in the United States for ties to Xinjiang, but they’ve also been subject to backlash in China when choosing to sever those ties.</p><p>Late last year, the Chinese government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/business/china-xinjiang.html" title="">said</a> it was investigating PVH, the corporate parent of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, for allegedly taking “discriminatory measures” against products from Xinjiang. H&amp;M and Nike have also faced criticism from consumers in China for breaking their ties.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ana Swanson covers trade and international economics for The Times and is based in Washington.
