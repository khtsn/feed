    <h1>Black Voters Matter Says It Will Spend $15 Million in Battleground States</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Black Voters Matter, the nonpartisan national organization focused on mobilizing Black Americans to the polls, will spend at least $15 million on voter engagement efforts through Election Day, its co-founder and executive director, Cliff Albright, said.</p><p>The group’s plans, which were shared exclusively with The New York Times on Monday, will span nearly a dozen presidential battlegrounds, including Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. They include radio advertisements, bus tours across cities and campuses of historically Black colleges and a vast canvassing operation aimed at increasing Black turnout in swing states and the Deep South. A key goal, Mr. Albright said, is to not only engage voters but get them to engage one another.</p><p>With the 2024 race being closely contested, both parties are aiming to increase their support among Black voters, a key constituency that has long been loyal to Democrats but in recent months <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/18/us/politics/biden-philadelphia-black-voters.html" title="">displayed alarmingly low enthusiasm</a> for re-electing President Biden. Black voters have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/kamala-harris-black-voters.html" title="">since been reinvigorated</a> by the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris, who if elected would be the country’s first Black and Indian woman to be president, but concerns about whether they will turn out en masse to elect her remain.</p><p>The mobilization efforts will include some programming focused on Black men, a voting bloc that is more open to supporting former President Donald J. Trump, according to polling and focus group data. While the vast majority of Black men are likely to support Ms. Harris, Mr. Trump has sought to make inroads, which could matter at the margins in close races.</p></div></div>
