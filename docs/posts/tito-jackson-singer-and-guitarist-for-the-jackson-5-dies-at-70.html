He was 70.</p><p>His death was announced in a statement early Monday by his three sons — Taj, Taryll and TJ — <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_929Mbuhsu/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on an Instagram account</a> dedicated to their music group, 3T.</p><p>A statement from a spokesman for his sister Janet Jackson said that Mr. Jackson died of a heart attack while driving to Oklahoma from New Mexico on Sunday.</p><p>The Jackson 5, one of the most popular musical acts of their era, were responsible for launching the solo career of Michael Jackson, who earned the title “King of Pop” and became one of the most emulated musicians of all time. The singer, songwriter and dancer <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/michael-jackson-hospitalized/" title="">died in 2009</a> at age 50.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The story of the Jackson 5, from their humble beginnings in Gary, Ind., to their various levels of success, has been well documented and was the subject of a five-hour mini-series in 1992 called “The Jacksons: An American Dream.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Jackson 5 in an undated photo.

The elder Mr. Jackson <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/obituaries/joseph-jackson-dies.html" title="">died in 2018</a>.</p><p>In a 2019 interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A_w198VMUI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">with Vlad TV</a>, Tito Jackson said that as a child, he would regularly play his father’s guitar behind his back.</p><p>“One day I broke the string and I didn’t know what to do about it,” he said. “He came home and saw the string broke and was really upset about it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After punishing him, Mr. Jackson said, his father asked him to demonstrate what he knew. His father gave him that guitar with the instructions to learn every song on the radio.</p><p>The family soon formed the Jackson Brothers, a group that included young Michael, who was given a spot after impressing the family with a performance of “Climb Every Mountain” at a talent show. The band’s name was later changed to the Jackson 5 after someone suggested it following a performance at a wedding.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Jackson 5 were household names in the 1970s, regularly appearing on television, sometimes next to Cher or Diana Ross. Their music — through more than a dozen albums — provided a soundtrack for a young generation and incited a level of fandom that is perhaps now only reserved for elite pop stars like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé.</p><p>“I remember the very first time we went to the U.K. and we had something like 10,000 screaming fans to greet us at the airport,” Mr. Jackson <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIaiuxv8HM" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Sister Circle TV in 2019</a>. “I got lost in the airport and 1,000 fans chasing me, pulling everywhere. It was crazy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Three of the Jackson 5’s biggest songs, “ABC,” “I Want You Back” and “I’ll Be There,” were inducted <a href="https://www.grammy.com/awards/hall-of-fame-award" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">into the Grammy Hall of Fame</a>. The group was inducted <a href="https://rockhall.com/inductees/jackson-5/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame</a> in 1997 alongside the Bee Gees.</p><p>Mr. Jackson continued to work in the music business over the years, releasing a solo album, “Tito Time,” in 2016, and touring alongside some of his brothers. The group, now called The Jacksons, were scheduled to perform in Atlantic City, N.J., in October and in Cincinnati in November.</p><p>“We’ve always said that it’s the fans that make the artist,” Mr. Jackson told Sister Circle TV. “We go to work, we make music and we do all these other things, but it’s actually the fans who love it and buy it.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
