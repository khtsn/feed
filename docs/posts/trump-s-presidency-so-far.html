    <h1>Trump’s Presidency So Far</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The first 100 days of Donald Trump’s second presidency have been a study of extremes, especially when compared with the start of presidential terms over the last century. Today, The Upshot — a section of The Times focused on data and policy — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/29/upshot/trump-100-days-charts.html" title="">published eight charts</a> comparing Trump’s performance with that of his predecessors. Here are a few of them:</p><h2 id="link-168a0d14">He issued more executive orders than any other modern president …</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Source: Federal Register | Data for Trump 2025 as of April 29. | By The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-executive-orders-list.html" title="">first day in office</a>, Trump signed a record 26 executive orders — and he didn’t stop there. The executive order has become something of a hallmark of his governing style, a way to express clear policy directives without the bureaucracy of regulation or the horse trading of legislation.</p><p>Some orders direct federal agencies to develop policy in particular areas, like oil drilling, prescription drug prices or the water pressure delivered by shower heads. Some mostly express the president’s sentiment on an issue. Some function as warnings or punishments for political enemies. But many — in key areas like immigration and tariffs — effectively carry the force of law. Compare the president’s output with that of Congress, which has passed only a handful of laws since Trump’s inauguration.</p><h2 id="link-3964be28">… and was sued in federal court more, too</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Source: PACER | Data for Trump 2025 as of April 29. | By The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Trump’s executive actions have already led to an explosion of lawsuits. In other recent administrations, the suits have come later, in response to laws and regulations that take months and years to develop. But Trump is moving quickly to cut funding, fire federal workers, impose tariffs, reshape immigration policy and more.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Although the Supreme Court has begun considering aspects of a few cases, most of this litigation is in preliminary stages.</p><h2 id="link-26248547">Markets plunged</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Source: LSEG | Shifts are relative to the value on the day the president was sworn in.

This time, he seems less focused on it. And some of his proclamations — on tariffs or his views on the Federal Reserve and interest rates — have led to wild swings in recent weeks.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has fallen by more than 7 percent since Trump’s inauguration, on track for the worst performance for stocks in this period of a presidency since Gerald Ford in 1974.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p><h2 id="link-4c94a333">Trump’s popularity fell, too</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Source: New York Times average of presidential approval polls | Data for Trump 2025 is as of April 29. | By The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>When Trump entered office, voters said they trusted him to handle the economy and immigration. But 100 days into his second term, his approval is underwater. Partly it’s because he turned those long-term strengths on the economy and immigration into weaknesses.

That’s because New York’s top court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/25/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-appeal" title="">overturned Harvey Weinstein’s 2020 conviction</a> for rape and a criminal sexual act. What happens now? I asked Hurubie Meko, who is covering his new trial for The Times. <em>— Adam B. Kushner</em></p><p><strong>Why is Harvey Weinstein on trial again?</strong></p><p>New York’s Court of Appeals said Weinstein had been deprived of a fair trial, because several women accused him of doing bad things to them even though they were not named in the charges against him. Now he’s being retried — this time with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-trial-new-york.html" title="">a new indictment</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p><strong>The charges are different this time?</strong></p><p>Yes, partly. A jury convicted Weinstein of rape and a criminal sexual act but acquitted him on three other charges, including accusations that he was a sexual predator. On those acquittals, he can’t be retried. This case is about sexual crimes against three women (two from before, plus a new one). They, but no other victims, will testify about Weinstein’s behavior toward them.</p><p><strong>Could he get out of prison if he wins this case?</strong></p><p>No. Weinstein was also convicted in California on sex-crime charges and sentenced to 16 years there. (He is appealing.) If he is acquitted in New York, he’ll begin his prison sentence there.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-54022da5">Tariffs</h2><ul><li><p>Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/trump-auto-tariffs-executive-order.html" title="">reduced some auto tariffs</a> after U.S. carmakers complained that the levies would squeeze their profits.</p></li><li><p>General Motors abandoned a previous forecast for solid profit growth this year because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/business/general-motors-profit-trump-tariffs.html" title="">uncertainty created by Trump’s policies</a>.</p></li><li><p>Trump’s tariffs have already slowed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/business/china-pmi-factory-manufacturing.html" title="">manufacturing activity in China</a>.</p></li><li><p>The White House attacked Amazon after a report that the company planned to display tariff costs in its listings.
