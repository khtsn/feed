    <h1>Trump Orders Gutting of 7 Agencies, Including Voice of America’s Parent</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The media outlets are intended to provide unbiased news to audiences around the world, but Mr. Trump has criticized its editorial decisions since his first term. Mr. Trump had already stirred fears at the agency by tapping Kari Lake, a fierce loyalist who ran unsuccessfully for governor and Senate in Arizona, to serve as a special adviser there.</p><p>The other agencies Mr. Trump targeted Friday are the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, which works to prevent and resolve work stoppages and labor disputes; the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a nonpartisan think tank; the Institute of Museum and Library Services, which funds and supports museums, libraries and archives; the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, which works to prevent and end homelessness; the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which provides financial assistance to struggling communities; and the Minority Business Development Agency, which aims to bolster minority-owned businesses.</p><p>Within seven days, the heads of the entities are required to submit to Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, their plans for complying with the order and outline which of their functions are statutorily required.</p><p>Since Mr. Trump took office, the billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have sought to drastically reshape the federal government by cutting staff and programs. On Tuesday, the Education Department announced it was firing more than 1,300 workers, and after hundreds accepted separation packages, the agency is set to be left with roughly half the number of employees that it started the year with.</p><p>Mr. Musk’s group has trumpeted saving taxpayers billions of dollars, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/doge-errors-funding-grants-claims.html" title="">though its claims have been undermined by posting error-filled data</a>. Some of its efforts have also been halted by federal judges, including on Thursday, when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/judges-federal-workers-reinstatement.html" title="">a pair of court rulings called for agencies to reinstate thousands of federal employees</a> who were fired last month because they had probationary status.</p></div></div>
