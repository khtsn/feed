    <h1>Supreme Court Pauses Ruling Requiring Trump to Rehire Thousands of Federal Workers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A904/352768/20250324090408115_Application%20America%20Federation%20of%20Govt%20Employees.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an emergency application</a> asking the Supreme Court to intervene, Sarah M. Harris, the acting solicitor general, wrote that federal judges have issued more than 40 temporary restraining orders or injunctions blocking administration programs. Many of them, she said, involved rulings that applied nationwide.</p><p>Judge Alsup’s order, she wrote, was particularly problematic.</p><p>“The court’s extraordinary reinstatement order violates the separation of powers, arrogating to a single district court the executive branch’s powers of personnel management on the flimsiest of grounds and the hastiest of timelines,” Ms. Harris wrote. “That is no way to run a government. This court should stop the ongoing assault on the constitutional structure before further damage is wrought.”</p><p><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A904/354676/20250403113212959_No.24A904.ResponseEmergencyStayMassFirings.FINAL.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In response</a>, the labor unions and nonprofit groups challenging the firings said the administration should not be allowed to argue that unwinding the firings would be burdensome because that harm was self-inflicted.</p><p>“While the government complains that the reinstatement of more than 16,000 employees at the six covered agencies is an ‘enormous’ task that would interfere with agency functioning (without presenting evidence supporting that assertion),” the challengers’ brief said, “the scale of the task is simply a reflection of the scale of the government’s own unlawful action and its ‘move fast and break things’ ethos.”</p><p>A different federal judge, James K. Bredar of the Federal District Court in Maryland, last month also <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.578045/gov.uscourts.mdd.578045.44.0_3.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ordered the administration</a> to reinstate federal workers in a case brought by 19 states and the District of Columbia. Last week, in <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.578045/gov.uscourts.mdd.578045.125.0_3.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an 84-page decision</a>, Judge Bredar again ruled for the states, though he limited the scope of his decision to people who live or work in those states and not in 31 others.</p><p>The administration has sought a stay of that ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which is expected to rule shortly.</p></div></div>
