She was slippery, she was feisty, she was named after a type of pork meatball. She was, of course, Moo Deng, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/style/moo-deng-baby-pygmy-hippo-thailand.html" title="">the pygmy hippo who rocketed to fame</a> so fast that at just 2 months old she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfIbbP3vuwA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inspired a character</a> on “Saturday Night Live.”</p><p>She wasn’t the only nonhuman newsmaker this year.

Sure, she was adorable. But when she wasn’t sleeping (which was often), she seemed perpetually peeved, throwing tantrums, biting her keepers and appearing to scream silently. Online, she was hailed as “ungovernable” and even portrayed as an aspirational figure for women — with her unapologetic attitude and enviably dewy skin.</p><p>As a feminist icon, however, Moo Deng was an uncomfortable choice. She was a member of an endangered species — just a few thousand pygmy hippos remain in the wild — and lived in a zoo, where visitors had taken to throwing objects at her. Her name, which literally meant “bouncy pork,” referred to a type of meat. And her image was co-opted to sell everything from makeup to cryptocurrency.</p><p>While social media stardom can be harnessed to support conservation efforts, it can also have the opposite effect. “Whenever there’s a very notable celebrity animal, especially a wild animal, there’s an uptick in desire to own them,” said Siobhan Speiran, an animal welfare scholar and geographer at York University in Canada. That was the sentiment that Moo Deng tended to elicit from online commenters: “It tends to be, ‘Oh, I want her.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-78fd7cf5">The marine marvels</h2><p>Moo Deng may have been a handful, but at least there was just one of her. In Oklahoma, the Clifford family discovered that its new pet octopus, Terrance, had not only been misidentified as a male but had also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/us/tiktok-octopus-pet-oklahoma.html" title="">laid 50 fertilized eggs</a>. The family attracted a large online audience as it chronicled its herculean efforts to keep the fragile hatchlings alive.</p><p>Still, when it came to surprises, Terrance had nothing on Charlotte, a stingray who <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/18LF2AasPL/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appeared to have become pregnant</a> despite the absence of male rays in her tank at the Aquarium &amp; Shark Lab in North Carolina.</p><p>The aquarium <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;v=1566631614084897" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">floated two possible explanations</a>. The first was parthenogenesis, a well-documented phenomenon in which the eggs of some species can develop into viable embryos without being fertilized by sperm. The second was that Charlotte had mated with one of the male sharks that shared her tank and was now pregnant with “a whole new species.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Charlotte the (maybe) pregnant stringray at the Aquarium &amp; Shark Lab in Hendersonville, N.C., in February.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aquarium &amp; Shark Lab by Team ECCO, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A baby hatchling of Terrance the octopus exploring the world outside its jar in Edmond, Okla., in April.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Noble Jr. for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The shark-mating theory was “obviously, preposterously silly,” David Shiffman, a marine conservation biologist, said. “Sharks and rays are separated by as many years of evolution as humans and snakes. If a human tried to mate with a snake, it would not result in a human-snake hybrid.”</p><p>But the idea set off a media frenzy. After months had passed with no signs of stingray pups, the aquarium announced that Charlotte had “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/teamecco/posts/758394856472698?ref=embed_post" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">developed a rare reproductive disease</a>,” then that she was “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/teamecco/posts/pfbid02qm9SRND8t9Ti5hVzQRk5v71PFARABK69Rd9Ry12PZ1bBym2wdGT3A4sffoYo1P5ol?rdid=WeUgpmzMkmWSXhR5#" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no longer pregnant</a>” and then that <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/18JavsYCzF/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she had died</a>.</p><p>In an email, Brenda Ramer, who runs the aquarium, said that a post-mortem examination had confirmed the reproductive disease, but she did not provide additional details or answer questions about whether Charlotte had ever actually been pregnant. (Some experts have speculated that Charlotte may have had a disease that mimicked the signs of pregnancy.)</p><p>“Certainly she was never pregnant with a half-shark, half-ray hybrid,” Dr. Shiffman said.</p><p>“A lot of important conservation stories about sharks, which are the most threatened group of vertebrate animals in the world, happened this year,” he noted. And yet, he added, “the most widely reported story about sharks is about a thing that didn’t really happen.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-46177f57">The political animals</h2><p>Not since Mitt Romney came under fire for transporting his dog in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/opinion/collins-dogging-mitt-romney.html" title="">a kennel on the roof of his car</a> have pets earned so much media coverage during a presidential race.</p><p>Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota saw her vice-presidential prospects dim when she boasted about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/26/us/politics/kristi-noem-dog-killing.html" title="">shooting and killing</a> her misbehaving young dog. Vice President-elect JD Vance was assailed for dismissing Democrats as “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/27/us/politics/jd-vance-trump.html" title="">childless cat ladies</a>.” In a nationally televised debate, President-elect Donald J. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/us/politics/trump-debate-immigrants-pets.html" title="">repeated false claims</a> that immigrants were stealing and eating pets.

But one through line was that the United States is, by and large, a nation that loves its pets. Even for Mr. Trump — a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/25/opinion/dogs-trump.html" title="">rare pet-less president</a> — Ms. Noem’s story seemed to cross “this invisible boundary,” said Clive Wynne, a canine-behavior expert at Arizona State University.</p><p>And then there was Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who confessed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/04/us/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr-bear-central-park.html" title="">depositing a dead bear cub</a> in Central Park and who was said to have used a chain saw to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/us/politics/rfk-jr-whale-head.html" title="">decapitate a dead whale</a>. (Mr. Kennedy then supposedly strapped the whale head to the top of his car and drove it home in a gruesome, cetacean version of the Romney affair.)</p><p>The lessons of these stories remain elusive. “What historical or cultural trend can we connect it to?” Dr. Wynne asked. “Just the vastly privileged doing vastly stupid things.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-3d57dc27">The borderline wild</h2><p>In a world transformed by humans, the line between captive animals and wild ones can be as fuzzy as the creatures that occupy that awkward middle ground. Take Nibi, a beaver who was found alone in the wild when she was far too young to fend for herself.</p><p>At Newhouse Wildlife Rescue, in Massachusetts, Nibi developed a taste for pistachios, a fondness for humans and an apparent contempt for others of her own kind.<strong> </strong>(In one video, she appears <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=856071662419326" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to be building a dam</a> in the doorway of the rescue’s rehab room to keep another young beaver at bay.)</p><p>The rescue eventually deemed her both a “diva” and “unreleasable,” so ill-suited for life in the wild that it went to court when a state agency ordered her release. The governor <a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/governor-healey-nibi-to-remain-at-wildlife-facility-as-educational-beaver" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ultimately intervened</a>, allowing Nibi to remain at the rescue.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nibi the diva beaver at the Newhouse Wildlife Rescue in Chelmsford, Mass.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jane Newhouse/Newhouse Wildlife Rescue, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An outpouring of support for Flaco in Central Park in March.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michelle V.

Flaco had lived his entire life in captivity, but he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/02/nyregion/flaco-owl-central-park-zoo.html" title="">proved to be an adept predator</a>, doing his part to keep the city’s rat population in check.</p><p>In February, after a year on the lam, Flaco died. The immediate cause <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/23/nyregion/flaco-owl-central-park-zoo-dead.html" title="">appeared to be a building collision</a>, but a necropsy revealed that Flaco also had dangerously high levels of toxic rodenticides in his system. These compounds, which are widely used for rat control, pose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/24/climate/flaco-owl-city-dangers.html" title="">a well-known threat</a> to birds of prey.</p><p>This fall, City Council <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/nyregion/eric-adams-city-council-rats.html" title="">passed a bill</a> calling for a pilot test of rodent birth control, which may prove to be a safer alternative. It became known as Flaco’s law.</p><p>“The outcry that happened after his death — it was like that of a beloved human figure,” said Rita McMahon, director of the Wild Bird Fund, a local rescue group that responded when Flaco was found gravely injured. “He has a legacy for us and for his fellow creatures.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Flaco the owl, seen free in New York’s Central Park.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeenah Moon for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emily Anthes is a science reporter, writing primarily about animal health and science.
