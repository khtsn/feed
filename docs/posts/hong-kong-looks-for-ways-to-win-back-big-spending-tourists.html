Buying only medicinal oils and retro comics as souvenirs, they spent less than $150 in the day and went back across the mainland China border to stay the night.</p><p>The sisters are part of a wildly popular trend among mainland Chinese who call themselves “special forces tourists”: independent travelers who get in and out of the city as quickly and cheaply as possible.</p><p>Mainland Chinese make up more than three-quarters of all tourists in the financial hub. But while they were once big spenders in Hong Kong — buying luxury watches, handbags and designer clothes — they now spend less time and money. That is a challenge to the city’s efforts to revive a travel economy hurt by years of antigovernment protests, pandemic restrictions and concerns in the West over its tightening of freedoms through a national security crackdown.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Hong Kong, which once billed itself as Asia’s World City, is now seeking to brand itself as the region’s events capital, emphasizing concerts and trade shows over shopping, to give travelers reasons to return and to spend more.</p><p>This year, it unveiled a $4 billion sports park at the site of the city’s former airport, Kai Tak. Its centerpiece is a purple-hued stadium with air-conditioning under each of its 50,000 seats. It was almost at full capacity during an annual Rugby Sevens tournament in late March.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chinese travelers with short, jam-packed itineraries often post strikingly similar photos on social media.

The new stadium left her speechless, she said, adding that the state-of-the-art facilities and the thrumming atmosphere made the games the experience of a lifetime.</p><p>The following month, kaleidoscopic visual effects were projected on its retractable roof during four sold-out nights of concerts by the band Coldplay. More events featured local and regional stars.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Some of these events are backed by a Mega Arts and Cultural Events Fund the government started in 2023, pledging up to $1.9 million in subsidies for approved events. The government is also supporting several high-profile soccer games, including a recent exhibition match involving Manchester United.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>One of the early concerts at Hong Kong’s new stadium was by a Cantopop star, Nicholas Tse, who performed in April.

And then when you come, you like it again, you become one of our old friends,” Rosanna Law, the city’s new secretary for culture, sports and tourism, said in an interview.</p><p>Tourism spending has been inching up since the pandemic, making up 2.6 percent of Hong Kong’s economic output in 2023, the most recent data available. But that is still far from the government’s target of 5 percent, which would be a little higher than prepandemic levels.</p><p>Industry experts say the challenge for Hong Kong is distinguishing itself from other Asian cities like Singapore and Bangkok, which have for years offered incentives to attract A-list stars, business conferences and sports tournaments.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Their strategy is very similar. That is a big problem for Hong Kong,” said Gary Bowerman, who heads a travel and tourism research firm called Check-in Asia.</p><p>Singapore has invested heavily to host marquee events such as an annual Formula One race and exclusive deals with undisclosed price tags for huge stars like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/05/world/asia/taylor-swift-singapore-eras-tour.html" title="">Taylor Swift</a> and Lady Gaga.</p><p>While such events help draw tourists who otherwise would not have visited, governments should not become too reliant on them, said Donald Low, a senior lecturer at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology’s Institute for Public Policy. “Even for Singapore, you don’t get somebody like Taylor Swift every year,” he said. “And even if you do, how many days of the year is it?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“You miss us, you come back.

The trade war between the United States and China has added to uncertainties.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>There were fewer visitors to Hong Kong from almost every part of the world in 2024 compared with 2018, according to the latest government data. Stuart Bailey, the chairman of the Hong Kong Exhibition and Convention Industry Association, said that many businesspeople from Europe and the United States whom he had spoken to had negative impressions about the city.</p><p>“It’s a good strategy, trying to put Hong Kong on the map to get people to come here,” he said. “I think it is the right thing because there’s a lot of misunderstanding.”</p><p>Ms. Law defended Hong Kong’s openness. “As long as you are law-abiding, as long as you are a genuine, proper tourist, you’ll be having a good time in Hong Kong,” she said.</p><p>The city is courting higher-spending visitors from regions like Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Whereas the city’s allure was once as a Westernized city on the tip of China, it is now embracing its closer relationship to nearby Chinese cities.</p><p>Ms. Law said that Hong Kong would keep working with mainland Chinese authorities to promote travel to the city as part of regional tours that include cities like Guangzhou and Shenzhen.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Drawing more tourists is increasingly important, as many Hong Kong residents now flock to the mainland on weekends and holidays for cheaper entertainment. (Over China’s five-day Golden Week holiday in early May, around 1.1 million tourists arrived in Hong Kong, but more than 1.68 million Hong Kong residents left the city.)</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>By emphasizing concerts and trade shows over shopping, Hong Kong hopes to give high spenders and business travelers reason to return.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anthony Kwan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Given that exodus, “it’s important to know that we are building a relationship with the people that are coming in,” said Michael Denmark, the owner of the company that operates a giant Ferris wheel on the waterfront. About 85 percent of the wheel’s 2.5 million visitors over the past 12 months came from mainland China, he said. Most of those were from the region of about 80 million people that surrounds Hong Kong, known as the Greater Bay Area.</p><p>Mr. Denmark, testing Chinese appetite for spending on more costly attractions, is currently co-producing a monthlong show by Cirque du Soleil. Ticket prices, from about $60 to $250, are significantly higher than the sponsor-subsidized $2.50 fare to ride the Ferris wheel. He was partnering with Chinese social media and travel companies, and has dedicated marketing teams targeting different audiences, including travelers from China.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In 2024, there were fewer visitors to Hong Kong from almost every part of the world than in 2018, according to the latest government data.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anthony Kwan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Corporate sponsors “all have very much their eyes wide open and their arms open to embrace everybody from Greater Bay and beyond in China,” he said. </p></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>June 8, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article had an incorrect time for the Golden Week holiday.
