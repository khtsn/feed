    <h1>Stocks Rebound After S&amp;P’s Fall Into Correction, but Trump Tariffs Keep Markets on Edge</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Until the haphazard tit-for-tat tariff threats are behind us, the uncertainty means markets will remain on edge,” John Canavan, the lead U.S. analyst at Oxford Economics, said in a note on Friday.</p><p>Those concerns are evident in other markets, too — including the gold market. Gold, which is often sought out by investors as a safe haven during times of turmoil, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/gold-price-record-high.html" title="">hit a record</a> on Friday, after breaking above $3,000 per troy ounce for the first time.</p><p>The key question remains “where fair value rests for a stock market that faces headwinds from tariffs, fiscal spending cuts and potentially softening economic data,” said Yung-Yu Ma, the chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management.</p><p>Friday’s rebound in stocks came despite new data from the University of Michigan that showed consumers were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/business/inflation-consumer-sentiment.html" title="">less confident</a> about the economic outlook and more worried about inflation. Investors will have more data points to consider soon, most notably the latest economic projections from the Federal Reserve, which is scheduled to meet and discuss its interest rate policy next week.</p><p>Investors don’t expect the Fed to begin cutting rates this month, but any signal that the central bank is more willing to do so — to bolster the economy — later this year could boost the falling market.</p></div></div>
