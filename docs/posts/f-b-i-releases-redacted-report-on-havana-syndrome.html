Later, American spies and diplomats in China, Austria and other parts of the world began reporting similar symptoms. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/us/politics/diplomat-attacks-havana-syndrome.html" title="">The growing number of complaints</a> fed intense speculation that an adversarial power could have used covert high-tech weapons, or other devices, to injure American officials.</p><p>When the Biden administration took office, officials were initially skeptical of the F.B.I.’s conclusions. The C.I.A., State Department and other agencies pledged to improve health care for people suffering from symptoms associated with Havana syndrome and to conduct a renewed inquiry into the causes. The C.I.A. formed a cell that scrubbed intelligence reports to see if an adversarial state was responsible.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/20/us/politics/havana-syndrome-cia-report.html" title="">the C.I.A.</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/01/us/politics/havana-syndrome-intelligence-report.html" title="">then the Office of the Director of National Intelligence</a> concluded it was very unlikely a foreign power was behind the ailments. They found no evidence that Russia, Cuba or China was carrying out a campaign using devices capable of delivering directed energy. Instead, the reviews attributed many of the symptoms to underlying medical issues, environmental factors and stress — the same factors the 2019 F.B.I. report highlights.</p><p>The 2019 report takes a skeptical view of Havana syndrome, using the word “victim” in quotation marks to describe people reporting symptoms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Based on information available at the time this report was prepared, our analysis indicates several of the ‘victims’ in these cases may have experienced an episode of mass psychogenic illness or social contagion,” a partly redacted sentence in the report said.</p><p>The F.B.I. said it had begun investigating the cases out of Havana in May 2017 and the cases out of China in May 2018. The inquiry first appeared to focus on any weapon or devices that could have been a cause. “This case revolves around the issue of whether an unknown offender(s) used an unknown device that may emit frequencies or waves to injure these individuals,” the report said.</p><p>But the report concludes that many of those reporting ailments had experienced “fairly common symptoms” from “predetermined medical conditions” or environmental factors.</p><p>Like subsequent studies, the report stated that the bureau could not “identify any single cause for these symptoms.”</p><p>Many of those subject to the ailments have continued to reject suggestions that stress, environmental factors or mass hysteria were behind their symptoms. They have criticized studies that raised doubts about whether Havana syndrome <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/us/politics/havana-syndrome-brain-studies-nih.html" title="">was associated with measurable head injuries</a>, and have pushed the government to continue investigating possible foreign causes. Intelligence officials say they continue to do so.</p><p>Under the Havana Act, the U.S. government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/us/politics/havana-syndrome-compensation.html" title="">began compensating diplomats and spies</a> who had been disabled during their service, starting with C.I.A. officers who had been forced to retire because of the severity of their symptoms.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Goldman writes about the F.B.I. and national security.
