There is a Eurovision plotline. There is a #MeToo plotline. And there is a character whose whole personality is “hot chef.” On top of it all, there’s a tense scene at Claude Monet’s water lily pond. The driving narrative question, of course, is, still, who Emily will date.</p><p>The first half of Season 4 was released on Netflix, and members of the Styles desk gathered to discuss the show, the characters and the battiest looks.</p><p><strong>Callie Holtermann</strong> Zut alors! The show has returned with several cardigans I would not wish upon my worst enemy.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Madison Malone Kircher</strong> Stripes around the world are currently forming a class-action lawsuit against this season of the show.</p><p><strong>Louis Lucero II</strong> Still, there are silhouettes and shrugs that have never before been seen in a workplace. Emily Cooper (Lily Collins) continues to innovate, no matter what anyone else wishes.</p><p><strong>CH</strong> Emily wears an outfit to a masquerade ball that I can truly only describe as “Hamburglar.”</p><p><strong>Katie Van Syckle</strong> And there were two of them!</p><p><strong>LL</strong> I can’t be the only one to have gotten top notes of Audrey Hepburn’s Eliza Doolittle (in addition to a base of McDonald’s I.P.)</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Eurovision-bound bandmates: Etienne (Jin Xuan Mao), Mindy (Ashley Park) and Benoit (Kevin Dias).</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Netflix</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p><strong>KVS</strong> Grégory Elliott Duprée, portrayed by the playwright Jeremy O. Harris, is still one of the most entertaining characters, and the pants he produced this season were fantastic.</p></div><div><div><p><strong>MMK</strong> And also one of the more whimsical costuming moments of the season. This is what I am here for. Penis pants!</p><p>In seriousness, this is the level of ridiculous that makes this show a treat despite minimal stakes and diminishing returns. I hope the second half of the season has more to offer.</p><p><strong>CH</strong> The trick of this show is not to ask too many questions.</p><p><strong>LL</strong> Such as: At what point does Emily’s indifference to the Parisian way of life begin to constitute hostility to a foreign power? Jogging, sipping out of a mug the size of a church bell … the crimes stack up quite quickly in Season 4.</p><p><strong>MMK</strong> Or why can’t these hot, young people just open up their relationship? Is Mindy Chen, played by Ashley Park, still living on Emily’s couch?</p><p><strong>LL</strong> JVMA, the show’s thinly veiled LVMH — Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy — equivalent, also consumes a lot of oxygen on Season 4. Access to its brand closet is even offered as an olive branch to a body-shamed Mindy. That particular story line reflected the show’s peculiar politics: indignation at having one’s body policed can be allayed with a shopping spree?</p></div></div><div><p><strong>CH</strong> It’s a bit of a paradox: At times, you feel the writers straining to raise the stakes. But to offer any real resolution would feel out of step with the rest of the show’s frippery.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Emily’s colleagues Luc (Bruno Gouery) and Julien (Samuel Arnold.) </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Netflix</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p><strong>MMK</strong> I watched it all in a single sitting but I found myself using my phone significantly more while watching this season than in past.</p><p><strong>CH</strong> To me, the beating heart of this show is Luc (Bruno Gouery), Emily’s frazzled colleague who lives on a houseboat and is romantically involved with the woman who supposedly gives out Michelin stars. He is the show at its best: inexplicable, chaotic, entertaining.</p><p><strong>MMK</strong> The field trip to Claude Monet’s garden at Giverny was a particular favorite for me. I gasped a little when Emily and Camille inevitably wound up going for a fully clothed dip in the pond. Those poor water lilies.</p><p><strong>LL</strong> I’m sure you were as amused as I was by Camille’s choice of rowboat-volunteering attire.</p><p><strong>MMK</strong> That is indeed what I wear to volunteer doing what I presume is a lot of grounds work. Crisp white button-up, just perfect for pruning and hoeing.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Camille (Camille Razat) as she volunteers at Claude Monet’s garden.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Netflix</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p><strong>LL</strong> Their return to Paris in head-to-toe Claude Monet museum merch was a nice sight gag.</p><p><strong>KVS</strong> How much do you think it will cost for Mindy and her bandmates to prepare for Eurovision?</p><p><strong>LL</strong> I’d bet more than one pre-worn skirt suit, which Mindy sold.</p><p><strong>MMK</strong> I thought it was very cute that Mindy and the band acted like 3,000 euros was going to go far!</p><p><strong>LL</strong> Her Eurovision delusions don’t stop at the cost, either: I’m thinking specifically of the matching printed suit jacket and pleated miniskirt she wore to an Important Eurovision Business Meeting, topped off with a pink sailor hat.</p><p>Dress for the gig you want to be able to finance!</p></div></div><div><p>Callie Holtermann<!-- -->, <!-- -->Madison Malone Kircher<!-- -->, Louis Lucero II and <!-- -->Katie Van Syckle<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
