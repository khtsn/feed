Camera crews have filmed brain surgeries and births. They have filmed patients receiving good news and patients learning their cancer is back. And all along, the doctors have spoken candidly about their work and their lives.</p><p>It has made for riveting television, including Netflix’s hit “Lenox Hill,” a docuseries about the doctors and patients in Northwell’s hospital on the Upper East Side. The documentary “The First Wave” was filmed inside another Northwell hospital during the deadly early days of Covid-19.</p><p>Now, Northwell wants to ramp up the number of movies and shows set in its hospitals. Last month, it announced it was starting a production company called Northwell Studios to make more TV shows and films. Five new productions are underway already.</p><p>Michael J. Dowling, the C.E.O. of Northwell, said he found actual doctors far more compelling to watch than actors playing them on TV. “This is the real stuff,” he said in an interview.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The notion of a hospital’s branching out into the entertainment business drew headlines in Hollywood. (<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/northwell-health-film-tv-studio-documentaries-1235956697/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Hollywood Reporter had the scoop</a>.)</p><p>It also raises questions about logistics and patient privacy. Beyond the risk of broadcasting botched procedures and aggrieved or dissatisfied patients, or doctors, hospitals must navigate stringent privacy rules and laws, and Northwell’s willingness to allow film crews to set up shop in its hospitals is a rarity these days.</p><p>In 2016, another hospital, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, paid a $2.2 million penalty to federal regulators <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/nyregion/new-york-hospital-to-pay-fine-over-unauthorized-filming-of-2-patients.html" title="">after television crews from the documentary series “NY Med” filmed two patients</a> without their consent. One patient had been hit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/nyregion/dying-in-the-er-and-on-tv-without-his-familys-consent.html" title="">by a garbage truck and was dying</a>, and though the TV show had blurred his face, it was not enough, federal regulators found.</p><p>At the time, hospital administrators and medical ethicists thought the penalty could spell <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/nyregion/new-york-hospital-to-pay-fine-over-unauthorized-filming-of-2-patients.html" title="">the end of real-life shows</a> set in hospitals. But Northwell executives note they have already had a string of successes and say the studio’s goal is to keep the hits coming.</p><p>“We’re very careful to make sure we protect privacy and get everybody’s permission,” Mr. Dowling said. “We’ve never had a problem in any of these shows.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>The most popular of them is “Lenox Hill,&#34; based in the hospital of the same name on East 77th Street. It was filmed starting in 2018 but aired in June 2020, not long after New Yorkers had started banging pots and pans in a nightly tribute of thanks to health care workers.</p><p>The show brought viewers into the operating room, where neurosurgeons battled tumors and opened up about their personal lives. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/12/nyregion/david-langer-lenox-hill-hospital.html" title="">It turned some of its central characters</a> into <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/06/02/netflix-doctor-wife-are-listing-upper-east-side-for-4-35m/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">local celebrities</a>.</p><p>It also was good for Northwell. Though renowned for its cardiac program, Lenox Hill was something of a sleepy Upper East Side hospital until perhaps a decade ago. It was sandwiched between two giant institutions — Mount Sinai and Weill Cornell. But after it was acquired by the hospital system that became Northwell, Lenox Hill’s fortunes began to improve with ambitious hires and a new neurosurgery program.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The hospital system is looking to make both unscripted and scripted shows.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gabriela Bhaskar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>Internal polling conducted by Northwell indicates that the various shows filmed at its hospitals — which include a spinoff of “Lenox Hill” called “Emergency NYC” and a new two-part Max series on an inpatient psychiatric unit — have all been good advertising, executives said. One marketing slide indicated that viewers who had seen some of the shows were more likely to recommend Northwell Health to others.</p></div><div><div><p>Mr. Dowling, the C.E.O., said he was committed to helping make the shows for “humanitarian reasons, educational reasons.” He said he felt “a real responsibility to provide educational material to the public about what goes on inside a health care facility.”</p><p>The shows were also morale boosters for staff members and advertised the skills of Northwell surgeons, he said.</p><p>Mr. Dowling has turned Northwell into the state’s largest hospital system during his tenure. It now has 21 hospitals and earlier this year announced plans to acquire Nuvance, a Connecticut health system, as well.</p><p>Mr. Dowling said that Northwell had not received any payments for the documentaries and shows that had aired on major streaming services, at least so far. Those shows got their start when filmmakers and producers approached the hospital system seeking access.</p><p>Northwell executives said the hospital system’s new studio would provide a more structured process for evaluating any pitches — and could help with generating ideas from within the hospital.</p><p>In a news release, the hospital system said its studio venture had a development deal with a production company, <a href="https://www.creativechaosvmg.com/about-us" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CreativeChaos vmg</a>, “to develop and co-produce both scripted and unscripted films.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Joseph Goldstein covers health care in New York for The Times, following years of criminal justice and police reporting.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joseph-goldstein">More about Joseph Goldstein</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Tragic End to an Instagram-Perfect Hamptons Life: </strong>A couple showed the public a world of glittering parties and vacations. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/nyregion/brandon-miller-suicide-debt.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">The money to sustain it did not exist</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brooklyn’s Great Goldfish Heist: </strong>In Bedford-Stuyvesant, an animal lover thought she was doing the right thing by freeing fish from a sidewalk pit. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/nyregion/goldfish-sidewalk-pond-brooklyn.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">But was it a rescue or a robbery</a>?</p></li><li><p><strong>Zombie Pharmacies: </strong>Over a million square feet of prime real estate is collecting dust across New York City. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/nyregion/pharmacies-vacant-drugstores-retail.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">It could stay that way for years</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Street Wars: </strong>New York City bus stops without trees or shelter are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/nyregion/street-wars-hot-bus-stops.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">leaving riders sweating</a> as they wait — and wait — for buses that a transportation group says do not come fast enough.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sunday Routine: </strong>Jackie Chang, a subway mosaic artist, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/nyregion/jackie-chang-subway-mosaics.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">spends her Sundays</a> designing in her studio, making Taiwanese breakfast and practicing violin.</p></li></ul></section></div></article></div></div></div>
