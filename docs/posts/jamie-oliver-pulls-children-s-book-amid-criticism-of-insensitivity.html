In one example, critics said, Ruby uses First Nations words that would not be realistic based on where her character was brought up. </p><p>The book is a sequel to Mr. Oliver’s debut children’s book, “Billy and the Giant Adventure,” which was published in 2023. “Billy and the Epic Escape” follows the same group of children on a fantasy adventure during summer vacation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Calls to pull the book from shelves were led by the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Corporation, an educational group that works on behalf of First Nations communities in Australia. In a statement released this month, the group called Mr. Oliver’s depictions “irresponsible and damaging, reflecting a profound lack of understanding and respect.”</p><p>The book’s depiction of Ruby’s abduction from her home in Australia — in a chapter titled “To Steal a Child” — was particularly insensitive, the group said. The country continues to reckon with the history of the so-called <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/05/24/australias-aboriginal-stolen-generation-tells-its-stories/" title="">Stolen Generations</a>, which refers to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children who were forcibly taken from their families in the 20th century and placed in government-run assimilation programs.</p><p>The depiction of child abduction in Mr. Oliver’s book, the group said, “dangerously trivializes the ongoing trauma associated with Australia’s violent history of child removal.”</p><p>“I am devastated to have caused offense and apologize wholeheartedly,” Mr. Oliver said in a statement. “It was never my intention to misinterpret this deeply painful issue. Together with my publishers we have decided to withdraw the book from sale.”</p><p>The recall of the book illustrated one of the pitfalls in the increasingly popular — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/16/im-parking-my-guilt-confessions-of-a-celebrity-childrens-book-ghost-writer" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and much debated</a> —<span>  </span>trend of A-list celebrities dabbling in children’s literature.
