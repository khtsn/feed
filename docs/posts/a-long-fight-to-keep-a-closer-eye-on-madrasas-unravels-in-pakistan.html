For devout families, they offer Islamic learning rooted in ancient tradition.</p><p>But to the Pakistani government and Western counterterrorism officials, the religious seminaries known as madrasas also represent a potential threat. The institutions have long been accused of contributing to violence and radicalization, supplying recruits for the Taliban, Al Qaeda and other militant groups.</p><p>Now, Pakistan’s Islamic schools are at the center of an intense political clash — one that jeopardizes years of hard-won progress toward bringing the seminaries under the government’s regulatory umbrella.</p><p>The conflict goes back to 2019, when the government enacted a sweeping overhaul requiring madrasas to register with the Ministry of Education. The effort, meant to increase accountability for institutions that have historically operated with minimal state oversight, was strongly backed by Pakistan’s military but faced vehement resistance from Islamist political parties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In October 2024, the largest of those parties, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, secured a deal with the government to end the registration requirement. Under the agreement, madrasas would be registered as they had been before 2019, under a colonial-era law governing charitable, scientific and educational groups. That law provides little oversight of<span>  </span>curriculums, activities or funding.</p><p>In exchange, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam agreed to support unrelated constitutional amendments on judicial appointments that had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/world/asia/pakistan-judiciary-amendments.html" title="">set off a firestorm of controversy.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Maulana Abdul Wasay, senator and leader of the Islamist party Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, addressing students at a graduation ceremony in Chaman, Pakistan, on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Akhter Gulfam/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As the end of the year approached, however, the government had still not implemented the change. It cited concerns that reverting to the older system could undermine counterterrorism efforts, weaken oversight and breach international commitments to combat money laundering and terrorism financing.</p><p>The delay triggered threats of anti-government protests in Islamabad, the capital, adding to the government’s challenges amid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/asia/islamabad-pakistan-protest-pti.html" title="">frequent marches by supporters</a> of Imran Khan, the ousted prime minister.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“We are firm on the agreed madrasa registration terms and will ensure they are upheld,” Maulana Fazlur Rehman, the chief of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, warned in Parliament last month. “If the government deviates, the decision won’t be made in Parliament, but on the streets.”</p><p>Late last week, the government finally approved the new registration provision, allowing madrasas to choose between modern oversight and the colonial-era framework. The move, in effect, discards the 2019 efforts to reform religious schools in favor of short-term political stability.</p><p>When Pakistan was created 77 years ago, madrasas numbered in the dozens. They gained prominence and grew significantly in the 1980s, when U.S. and Arab funding transformed them into recruitment hubs for Islamic volunteers to fight Soviet forces in neighboring Afghanistan. Today, there are about 30,000 madrasas in Pakistan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Maulana Fazlur Rehman, the chief of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, center, during a news conference in Dera Ismail Khan District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saood Rehman/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Many future Taliban leaders were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/25/world/asia/pakistan-taliban-afghanistan-madrasa.html" title="">educated in these institutions</a>, where some teachers endorsed the anti-U.S. ideology of Al Qaeda.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Pakistan came under increased pressure to regulate the religious schools after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, said <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/politics-and-religion/article/political-survival-through-religious-instrumentalism-jamiat-ulamaeislam-fazlur-rehmans-resistance-to-madrassah-reforms-in-pakistan/F76F465DCA117554922E08D48EB02AC3?utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=bookmark" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Abdur Rehman Shah</a>, a madrasa affairs expert affiliated with Tongji University in Shanghai.</p><p>“The post-9/11 war on terror and events like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/18/international/europe/three-london-bombing-suspects-visited-pakistan-last.html" title="">the 2005 London bombings</a> raised global concerns about the lack of effective madrasa monitoring,” Mr. Shah said.</p><p>After militants <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/17/world/asia/taliban-attack-pakistani-school.html" title="">attacked</a> a military-run school in northwestern Pakistan in 2014, killing more than 145 people — mostly children — observation of madrasas became central to counterterrorism efforts. Security agencies used GPS to map the schools and carried out raids and interrogations targeting seminaries suspected of militant links, Mr. Shah said.</p><p>In 2019, the government established the new regulatory framework to curb Islamist parties’ influence over the seminary boards that govern madrasas. More than 17,500 madrasas enrolling 2.2 million students were registered with the Ministry of Education, according to official data.</p><p>Registration streamlined visa processing for international students, as madrasas attracted increasing interest not only from the Pakistani diaspora but also from students in African and Southeast Asian countries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>However, many seminaries, particularly those aligned with Islamist parties, including the country’s largest and most prominent ones, resisted integration into the formal system, citing fear of government interference in religious education.</p><p>After the government agreed last October to end the requirement for registration with the Ministry of Education, officials hesitated to move forward in part because of intensified scrutiny from the Financial Action Task Force, a global watchdog based in Paris.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At the graduation ceremony in Chaman on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Akhter Gulfam/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The task force had placed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/world/asia/pakistan-terrorism-funding.html" title="">Pakistan on its “gray list</a>” from 2018 to 2022 for deficiencies in combating money laundering and terrorism financing — a designation that often leads to reduced foreign investment and heightened financial oversight.</p><p>“F.A.T.F.’s main demand was a crackdown on terrorism financing, particularly targeting U.N.-designated individuals and entities, including their madrasas,” said <a href="https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/sanaa-ahmed" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sanaa Ahmed</a>, an assistant professor of law at the University of Calgary who researches illicit financial flows and terrorism financing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>To comply with the task force’s requirements, Pakistan in 2019 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/world/asia/pakistan-terrorism-blacklist-sanctions.html" title="">seized control of several</a> madrasas linked to banned militant groups such as Jaish-e-Muhammad and Lashkar-e-Taiba.</p><p>But after more than two decades of increased examination of madrasas, education experts argue that the efforts overlook a deeper crisis: the country’s struggling public education system, which fails to meet the needs of millions of children, particularly from low-income families.</p><p>Pakistan has the second-highest number of out-of-school children globally, with 22.8 million ages 5 to 16 not attending school — 44 percent of this age group, according to <a href="https://www.unicef.org/pakistan/education" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UNICEF</a>.</p><p>Madrasas, supported by private donations, partly fill the gaps in the public system.

Their heads, covered with cotton-knit caps, were bowed over Islamic books, fingers tracing the Arabic script.

While not all of the schools are linked to militancy, many promote a narrow interpretation of Islam, emphasizing doctrinal purity and the defense of Islam against other faiths.</p><p>Critical thinking and open dialogue are not primary focuses. Madrasas’ resistance to incorporating subjects like computer science or mathematics leaves graduates ill-equipped for the contemporary job market.</p><p>For many families, it is not poverty, but religious conviction, that drives them to enroll children in madrasas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>“I could send my children to private schools to study computers and science, but I’m sending them to a madrasa because I want them to study Islamic education,” said Abdul Wahab, a real estate dealer in Karachi, in southern Pakistan.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A religious school student getting ready to mark the birth anniversary of the Prophet Muhammad in Karachi in 2021.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Akhtar Soomro/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Like many devout people in Pakistan, Mr. Wahab believes that a child who memorizes the Quran will bring blessings to the family, including the promise of taking 10 others to paradise in the afterlife.</p><p>Despite concerns over radicalization, madrasa administrators say they are unfairly blamed for militancy. “There are many people who go to liberal schools and are radicalized,” said Qari Shahid Gul, a teacher at a madrasa in Karachi.</p><p>He cited Saad Aziz, a graduate of a prestigious business school who was sentenced to death after confessing to involvement in several terrorist activities, including the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/14/world/asia/karachi-bus-attack-kills-members-of-ismaili-sect.html" title="">killing of 45 members of the Ismaili sect</a> of Shiite Islam.</p><p>“Terrorism must be curbed, but scapegoating madrasas is not the solution,” Mr. Gul said.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
