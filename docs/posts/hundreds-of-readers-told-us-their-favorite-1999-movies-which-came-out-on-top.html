The Class of 1999 series — our class project, so to say — took form as a retrospective, sifting through films and moments that inspired a generation at the dawn of a new millennium.</p><p>It dissected the revolutionary power of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/movies/the-matrix-ai-film.html" title="">The Matrix</a>” and “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/movies/blair-witch-project-reality-anniversary.html" title="">The Blair Witch Project</a>,” which manipulated our minds into believing what we saw was real. It examined legacies, in conversation with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/movies/haley-joel-osment-sixth-sense.html" title="">Haley Joel Osment</a> and the “risky stunts, not risky roles” ethos of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/movies/tom-cruise-eyes-wide-shut-magnolia.html" title="">Tom Cruise</a>. In essence, the last year of the ’90s had earned itself the title of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/movies/1999-box-office-runaway-bride-sixth-sense-thomas-crown-affair.html" title="">the year of uncertainty</a>,” at least according to Wesley Morris.</p><p>As for myself, I’d define 1999 through the stylistic lens of “<strong>SLC Punk</strong>,” “<strong>American Movie</strong>” and “<strong>Girl, Interrupted</strong>.” (Passionate and a bit misdirected; gritty and a bit manic.) When our film staff writers and critics made their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/movies/1999-movies-critics.html" title="">list of favorite films from 1999</a>, we of course had to ask New York Times readers to weigh in on their favorite movie of the year — a question that spawned more than a thousand submissions (almost) overnight.</p><p>“<strong>The Matrix</strong>” was mentioned nearly twice as often as any other film. “<strong>Fight Club</strong>,” “<strong>Office Space</strong>,” “<strong>American Beauty</strong>” and “<strong>Magnolia”</strong> followed suit, in that order. (“American Beauty,” directed by Sam Mendes, won the Oscar for best picture.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Many readers sent us lists, unable to choose just one film, while others gave an elaborate and detailed retelling of a first viewing. Here’s a sampling of what our readers picked, covering everything from teenage escapades to heart-racing thrills to gut-wrenching dramas.</p><h2 id="link-4e55c954">‘<a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-matrix" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Matrix</a>’ Is Everywhere</h2><p>Mike Ruddell of New York:</p><blockquote><p>By 2024, “The Matrix&#34; is feeling more relevant (and plausible!) by the day, thanks in part to our obsession/tension with breeding ever more capable A.I., our cultural fixation on antihero hackers and leakers, our ongoing destruction of the planet, and our weirdly brat green digital culture. At this point only the phones feel dated.</p><p>But that’s not what makes this a good movie. “The Matrix” is the best movie of 1999 because of the insanely inventive plot (or conceit?), the thesis-worthy philosophical themes, the kick-ass mishmash of Wing Chun, jujitsu, cyberpunk, shoot-em-up action, and C.G.I. “bullet time” (a term coined thanks to the film), the most “1999” film anyone could possibly think up. As Gen Z would say, “The Matrix” is a vibe.</p><p>I still get an adrenaline rush from the closing scene when Neo, fresh off his obliteration of the Agents, puts on his shades, looks to the sky, and FLIES.</p></blockquote><p>Neeraj Gupta of London:</p><blockquote><p>Growing up in India, on a diet of Bollywood movies, “The Matrix&#34; was the first English film that I had watched in a cinema. I distinctly remember being wowed by the plot and coming home to think if all of us are actually living in the Matrix. To this day, I can’t shake that feeling!</p><p>It is a cult classic with scenes and props etched in my memory, from the long black leather coats to Morpheus’s frame less glasses, and of course Neo’s gravity defying bullet dodge. A movie that made a lasting impact on me.</p></blockquote><p>Dylan Feldpausch of Chicago:</p><blockquote><p>It epitomizes the alienation of modernity through a (literally and figuratively) subterranean queer lens. I remember watching it as a kid and being inexplicably drawn to its aesthetic, and only as an adult realizing how important it was to me as a nonbinary person — particularly the idea that you can imagine yourself into any identity no matter how inaccessible it may seem to you, and that your power in that identity comes from a strong commitment to your truest self.</p></blockquote><p>Paddy Free of Auckland, New Zealand:</p><blockquote><p>I was 10 in 1977, the perfect age for “Star Wars.” Walking out of “The Matrix,” I felt the feelings I’d hoped to feel walking into “The Phantom Menace.” 1999’s Great Disappointment and 1999’s Great Redeemer.</p></blockquote><h2 id="link-598c335d">Drama. Drama. Drama.</h2><p>Kevin Hengehold of Seal Beach, Calif., on “<strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-sixth-sense" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Sixth Sense</a></strong>”:</p><blockquote><p>Not your typical ghost story, and I still watch it whenever I see it on. Fantastic in-depth acting led by Haley Joel Osment along with Toni Collette and Bruce Willis. “I see dead people” is a line that will live on long after I’m gone … and I’m not planning on coming back to watch my wedding video …</p></blockquote><p>Katie Robleski of Milwaukee on “<strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/mag-noli-a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Magnolia</a></strong>”:</p><blockquote><p>I’m glued to the screen in a dark theater as Aimee Mann’s “Save Me” swells. John C. Reilly quietly delivers his monologue until Melora Walters breaks the fourth wall (and her gut-wrenching pain) with that hopeful smile — cut to black (and to my tears rolling with the credits). Perhaps being 19 made all the difference, but everything about “Magnolia” — Tom Cruise, full cast breaking into song, raining frogs, and 3-hour runtime included — completely changed cinema for me. I miss that era.</p></blockquote><p>Zac Oldenburg of San Francisco on “<strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/eyes-wide-shut" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eyes Wide Shut</a></strong>”:</p><blockquote><p>My memories started on a 4:3 aspect ratio DVD, but the film became a revelation once I saw it in a theater. Kidman is alluring on every level, and Cruise gives himself over to Kubrick in a way he has never done again for a director. It’s just an incredible film that sends Kubrick out on a high note.</p></blockquote><p>Alex Arroyo of Littleton, Colo. on “<strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/fight-club" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fight Club</a></strong>”:</p><blockquote><p>I remember I was in junior high, a group of friends and I going to watch it in theaters. We were so pumped afterward, we just wanted to start our own fight club … we never did though; we were kinda nerds. But the idea of someone being so over all of the daily, typical BS and willing to do something to change it all, gave me hope and kinda made me feel like a badass for watching it.</p></blockquote><p>Dana Jacoby of Cotati, Calif., on “<strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/american-beauty" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Beauty</a></strong>”:</p><blockquote><p>From the first moment, this film had my attention: “In less than a year I’ll be dead. Of course, I don’t know that yet.” This film was funny, sad and deeply honest as it depicted its characters’ disconnection with who and what is truly precious, easily lost in the cacophony of superficial striving. I walked out of the theater heart sore but exhilarated, having seen a searing but ultimately compassionate story about the paradox of being human.</p></blockquote><h2 id="link-2f49176a">All Variety of Comedies</h2><p>Mel Murphy of Seattle on “<strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/office-space-1999" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Office Space</a></strong>”:</p><blockquote><p>As I entered the work force around this time, this movie created a relatable experience and an expectation of the future: annoying bosses on power trips, uninspiring work and job dissatisfaction, and who didn’t have a Nina in corporate accounts payable? It united us together as we compared our co-workers to these characters. As we let out a collective laugh followed by a long sigh, we put out our cigarettes and went back to work.</p></blockquote><p>Julie Blackwell of Richardson, Texas, on “<strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/galaxy-quest" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Galaxy Quest</a></strong>”:</p><blockquote><p>It’s a movie that both pays tribute to and pokes gentle fun at fandom culture (from a time when fandoms were niche and not mainstream). It features great performance from both big stars and if-you-know-you-know character actors. And it has a great big (though a little wacky) heart.</p></blockquote><p>Joshua Smith of Augusta, Ga., on “<strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/south-park-bigger-longer-and-uncut" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut</a></strong>”:</p><blockquote><p>What an audacious movie: like a joke on those English teachers trying to distinguish between satire and parody, the “South Park” movie is definitely both: an exposé of the stupidity of the culture wars and a parody of the fake uplift of Disney musicals. My early advocacy for this movie was vindicated when Stephen Sondheim touted its excellence, the Academy nominated “Blame Canada” for best song, and then, a few years later, its creators burned down Broadway with “The Book of Mormon.”</p></blockquote><p>Cassandra Freeland of Columbus, Ohio, on “<strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/being-john-malkovich" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Being John Malkovich</a></strong>”:</p><blockquote><p>A friend and I would go to movies at a small independent movie theater, the Drexel, on Mondays when there was a discount. I came home from this one, and my husband asked what it was about. I said, “It’s hard to describe. Let’s go see it.” And so I went again. And in the past couple of years, we sat down to watch it again with our young adult son. It is so offbeat and quirky and funny, from the story line to the characters.</p></blockquote><p>Katherine Jardine of Seattle on “<strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/drop-dead-gorgeous-1999" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Drop Dead Gorgeous</a></strong>”:</p><blockquote><p>drop dead hilarious</p></blockquote><h2 id="link-66f2bcab">Underrated and Understated</h2><p>Austin Eklund of Yonkers, N.Y., on “<strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/les-garcons-ne-pleurent-pas" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Boys Don’t Cry</a></strong>”:</p><blockquote><p>Truly a breakthrough in American queer cinema. Hilary Swank, Peter Sarsgaard and Chloë Sevigny are indelible, and the movie dares you to flinch before it does. (Spoiler: you’ll lose.)</p></blockquote><p>Geneva JauJou of Woodinville, Wash., on “<strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/run-lola-run" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Run Lola Run</a></strong>”:</p><blockquote><p>“Lola rennt,” subtitles and all, was my first encounter with a movie that takes multiple paths, and it had me riveted from the start. From the animated running interludes to the *chef’s kiss* photographic glimpses into the strangers’ futures (impacted, of course, by the tiniest exchange with Lola as she ran, a matter of seconds making all the difference), to Lola’s epic, glass-shattering scream of frustration. It got me then, it gets me now, I love it. And to this day, when I run out of shampoo, I murmur to myself “Lola, ich brauch Schampu!”</p></blockquote><p>Lloyd Stires of Pittsburgh on “<strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-hurricane-1999" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Hurricane</a></strong>”:</p><blockquote><p>I grew up not far from where the murders Rubin Carter was falsely convicted of committing took place. Believing that he was innocent, I followed the case for many years. The film is an important document about the racism that still infects our criminal justice system. It allowed me to re-experience the exhilaration I felt when I learned of his release from prison.</p></blockquote><p>Zachary Herrmann of Cranbury, N.J., on “<strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/ghost-dog-the-way-of-the-samurai" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai</a></strong>”:</p><blockquote><p>Deftly plays with genre conventions and honors its influences, while carving its own path as a really fun, quirky film. And the soundtrack rips.</p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3cbe1425">The Class of 1999 (Really)</h2><p>Casey Symons of Harrington Park, N.J., on “<strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/cruel-intentions-1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cruel Intentions</a></strong>”:</p><blockquote><p>Just a classic drama that blends everything from scandal to humor. The ending is one of the most iconic scenes of all time.</p></blockquote><p>Avery Wade of Anchorage on “<strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/election" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Election</a></strong>”:</p><blockquote><p>Watching a middle-aged teacher torpedo his career and marriage because he’s obsessed with delivering a comeuppance to an egotistical high schooler is hilarious. I rewatched it with my 13 yo daughter a while back and had to cover her eyes because I forgot the movie opens with the teacher having sex with his wife while he’s dreaming of the student. Meanwhile my wife is yelling downstairs “what are you watching?!?!?”</p></blockquote><p>Michael Adams of Royalston, Mass., on “<strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/jawbreaker" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jawbreaker</a></strong>”:</p><blockquote><p>It’s dark, funny and fashionable. I remember thinking I would totally and accidentally kill my best friend with a jawbreaker in a prank gone wrong.</p></blockquote><p>Valerie Smith of Cork, Ireland, on “<strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/but-im-a-cheerleader" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">But I’m a Cheerleader</a></strong>”:</p><blockquote><p>“But I’m a Cheerleader&#34; balanced the mostly dark stories, like “Boys Don’t Cry” (also ’99), with a comedic and loving touch. It also launched a generation of lesbian and queer people into the cinematic world. Most importantly, it introduced many of us to Natasha Lyonne, who we claim, and Clea DuVall, who claims us back. This is fun art that had an impact on so many of us, seeing ourselves out in the world with a joyful ending — something still rare enough in the movies!</p></blockquote><p>Merry Benezra of Wolfville, Nova Scotia, on “<strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/10-things-i-hate-about-you" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10 Things I Hate About You</a></strong>”:</p><blockquote><p>Julia Stiles.
