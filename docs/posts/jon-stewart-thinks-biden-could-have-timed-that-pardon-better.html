It was the talk of late night on Monday.</p><p>On “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart questioned the president’s timing.</p><blockquote><p>“Normally, you drop a controversial pardon like the way you buy porn at a gas station: in a flurry of other distracting purchases.” <em>— JON STEWART</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-1"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5BcIHPMAHw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><blockquote><p>“Thanksgiving! I knew it! Perhaps I can explain the way this pardon went down in my new one-man show, ‘Can You Get Hunter to Stop Looking at Me Like That?’” <em>— JON STEWART</em></p><p>“He’s an 82-year-old man — he doesn’t want to spend the rest of his life visiting his son in prison.” <em>— JON STEWART</em></p><p>“Hypocrisy isn’t illegal, nor is it particularly unusual in politics. It’s not like he’s ever going to run again, so why not take care of your kid, even if you said you weren’t going to? I respect it. I don’t have a problem with it. The problem is, the rest of the Democrats made Biden’s pledge to not pardon Hunter the foundation of their defense of America.” <em>— JON STEWART</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-4ed56830">The Punchiest Punchlines (World’s Greatest Dad Edition)</h2><blockquote><p>“Yeah, it was a big shopping weekend, and millions of people got great deals, but nobody got a better deal than Hunter Biden.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“Christmas came early for this guy.” <em>— TYRUS, guest host of “Gutfeld!”</em></p><p>“The Biden presidency has now entered the ‘Grandpa doesn’t give a damn about what you think’ phase.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“And, yes, Joe Biden did say he wasn’t going to pardon Hunter.
