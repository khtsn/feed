He replaced Justin Trudeau, who had led the Liberals for 13 years and the country for nearly a decade, but had grown deeply unpopular.</p><p>Mr. Carney had been widely expected to call for a quick election. He does not have a seat in Canada’s Parliament, and the Liberals do not command a majority, meaning that their government was likely to fall in a vote of no-confidence as early as Monday had he not called for the election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Liberals’ main opponents are the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s aggressive stance toward Canada has been a boon for the Liberals and Mr. Carney. Before Mr. Trump took office, the Conservatives had been ahead by double digits in polls and a victory for Mr. Poilievre seemed a foregone conclusion.</p><p>But voters have grown concerned that Mr. Poilievre is too ideologically similar to Mr. Trump to stand up to him, and they are drawn to Mr. Carney’s economics experience and long career on the international stage. Polls show that Mr. Carney and the Liberals have eliminated a 25-percentage-point lead held by the Conservatives and the two enter the election period neck-and-neck.</p><h2 id="link-71e7ac0d">Who’s running?</h2><p>Mr. Carney and the Liberals will square off against the Conservatives and Mr. Poilievre, 45, a career politician who made his name as an aggressive orator unafraid to adopt some of Mr. Trump’s style.</p><p>Mr. Poilievre is a mainstream conservative who has long supported deregulation, tax cuts and an abandonment of Trudeau-era environmental policies in order to enable Canada to ratchet up the exploitation of its vast natural resources, predominantly oil and gas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The leader of the Conservatives, Pierre Poilievre, greeting workers at Pioneer Construction in Sudbury, Ontario, on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gino Donato/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Poilievre has also waded into culture war topics and borrowed language from Mr. Trump: He attacks practices and politicians as “woke,” has called for the defunding of the Canadian national broadcaster and has said he believes there are only two genders.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He has also said he wants to make Canada the world’s cryptocurrency capital, showing the same affinity for the alternative financial asset as Mr. Trump.</p><p>Mr. Carney, by contrast, has been in the public eye for decades but not in a political capacity. He was governor of the Bank of Canada during the global financial crisis of 2008, and the Bank of England during Brexit.</p><p>Since then he has been working in senior roles in the private sector and has, in recent years, become a prominent advocate for sustainable investment, taking on a role as a United Nations special envoy on climate action and finance.</p><p>In the few short days that he has been in office, Mr. Carney has come across as fluent in economics and comfortable on the global stage, but less accustomed to the close scrutiny of his personal affairs, which is not unusual for people running for high public office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The third party, the Bloc Quebecois, is led by Yves-François Blanchet and is dedicated to Quebec nationalism.</p><p>Canada’s fourth-largest party, the New Democratic Party, led by Jagmeet Singh, is to the left of the Liberals. The N.D.P. offered support for the Liberal minority government in the House of Commons until September, and was able to get some of its core social policies approved in exchange.</p><h2 id="link-80d54c7">How do Canada’s elections work?</h2><p>Canada has a first-past-the-post electoral system, which means that candidates who get the most votes in their district win, regardless of whether they secure a majority. Voters elect local members of the House of Commons, not individual party leaders, as they would in a presidential system. Parties select their leaders, who then can become prime minister.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Voters preparing to cast ballots in Montreal, Quebec, during national elections in 2021.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrej Ivanov/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The country is divided into 343 electoral districts, known in Canada as ridings, each one corresponding to a seat in the House of Commons.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>To form a majority government, a party needs to win 172 seats. If the party with the most seats has fewer than 172, it can still form a minority government, but would need the support of another party to pass legislation.</p><h2 id="link-637e7577">What happens next?</h2><p>In the run-up to the election, Mr. Carney will remain prime minister and will technically continue to lead the country together with his cabinet. But they will be in “caretaker” mode and, under Canada’s conventions, can only focus on necessary business, such as dealing with routine or urgent matters. They cannot make new major or controversial decisions.</p><p>The parties and their leaders will hit the campaign trail immediately. For Mr. Carney, this will be a critical time since he is not an experienced campaigner, unlike Mr. Poilievre, who is seasoned in retail politics.</p><p>Both men will travel the vast country to try to secure support. Mr. Carney’s campaign will be open to journalists paying their own way to travel with him on the trail.</p><p>Mr. Poilievre’s campaign said it would not allow the news media to join him on trips, stressing that its decision was for logistical reasons and that news coverage was welcomed.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Musk Effect:</strong> Elon Musk is seemingly everywhere, dominating the news out of Washington and beyond.
