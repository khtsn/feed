    <h1>Elon Musk’s Financial Disclosure Will Not Be Made Public</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Elon Musk plans to file a financial disclosure report to the White House, but it will remain confidential, a White House official said Tuesday.</p><p>There has never been a White House staffer with the vast potential for conflicts like Mr. Musk, the world’s richest person and the head of leading companies in electric vehicles, space exploration and artificial intelligence.</p><p>But Mr. Musk is serving President Trump as an unpaid “special government employee,” which means his financial disclosure is not required to be made public.</p><p>Mr. Musk received an ethics training this week, the official said, and Mr. Musk’s staff as part of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency is in the process of receiving their own training, said the White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record.</p></div></div>
