Trump confirmed on Monday that he intended to declare a national emergency and use the U.S. military in some form to assist in his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/us/politics/trump-2025-immigration-agenda.html" title="">plans for mass deportations</a> of undocumented immigrants.</p><p>On his social media platform, Truth Social, Mr. Trump responded overnight to a post made earlier this month by Tom Fitton, who runs the conservative group Judicial Watch, and who wrote that Mr. Trump’s administration would “declare a national emergency and will use military assets” to address illegal immigration “through a mass deportation program.”</p><p>At around 4 a.m., Mr. Trump reposted Mr. Fitton’s post with the comment, “TRUE!!!”</p><p>Congress has granted presidents broad power to declare national emergencies at their discretion, unlocking standby powers that include redirecting funds lawmakers had appropriated for other purposes. During his first term, for example, Mr. Trump invoked this power to spend more on a border wall than Congress had been willing to authorize.</p><p>In interviews with The New York Times during the Republican primary campaign, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/us/politics/trump-2025-immigration-agenda.html" title="">described in an article published in November 2023</a>, Mr. Trump’s top immigration policy adviser, Stephen Miller, said that military funds would be used to build “vast holding facilities that would function as staging centers” for immigrants as their cases progressed and they waited to be flown to other countries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Homeland Security Department would run the facilities, he said.</p><p>One major impediment to the vast deportation operation that the Trump team has promised in his second term is that Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, lacks the space to hold a significantly larger number of detainees than it currently does.</p><p>That has sometimes led to allowing asylum seekers into the country while they await court dates with immigration judges, a practice critics deride as “catch and release.”</p><p>The Trump team believes that such camps could enable the government to accelerate deportations of undocumented people who fight their expulsion from the country. The idea is that more people would voluntarily accept removal instead of pursuing a long-shot effort to remain in the country if they had to stay locked up in the interim.</p><p>Asked about the proposal, Sabrina Singh, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon, declined to comment, calling it “a hypothetical.” In general, she added, such a plan would typically undergo “a rigorous process” before being enacted, but she declined to elaborate.</p><p>Immigrant advocates assailed the move, raising alarms about the potential fallout.</p><p>“President-elect Trump’s dystopian fantasies should send a chill down everyone’s spine, whether immigrant or native-born,” said Karen Tumlin, the director of the Justice Action Center, an immigrant advocacy organization. “Not only is what he is describing in all likelihood illegal, this move would be the exact opposite of the legacy of service in which my family members were proud to participate.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Robyn Barnard, the senior director of refugee advocacy at Human Rights First, asserted that the consequences would be far-ranging. “Families will be torn apart, businesses left without vital employees, and our country will be left to pick up the pieces for years to come,” she added.</p><p>Congressional Democrats responded with a similar level of incredulity, asserting that such a move was all but certain to violate federal laws preventing the use of the military on American soil.</p><p>“We’re pursuing whatever we can do to make clear that the Insurrection Act should not permit that use of the military,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, referring to the 1807 law that grants presidents emergency power to use troops on domestic soil to restore order when they decide a situation warrants it. Under that law, “if there is no threat to public order of a fundamental, far-reaching kind, it would be illegal,” he added.</p><p>Republicans, however, suggested that Mr. Trump’s proposal might not be a radical departure from the status quo.</p><p>“Obviously they’re not law enforcement, but I have to see what their process is,” said Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, who served as the lead Republican negotiator on a bipartisan immigration deal that failed to pass the Senate after Mr. Trump urged the G.O.P. to reject it. “If the National Guard is providing transportation, they do that a lot already.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Hard-right members of Congress and staunch supporters of Mr. Trump have expressed broad support for his proposal for mass deportations. Senator Tommy Tuberville, Republican of Alabama, <a href="https://x.com/TTuberville/status/1858514948013355337" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">chimed in on social media on Monday</a> to back using the military for such an effort, saying Mr. Trump was “100% correct.”</p><p>Mr. Miller has also talked about invoking a public health emergency power to curtail hearing asylum claims, as the Trump administration did during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the southern border amid a surge in asylum seekers and his reprogramming of military funds toward his border wall in 2019 was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/us/politics/trump-national-emergency-law.html" title="">face-saving way out of a spending standoff with Congress</a> that had led to a government shutdown. It led to legal challenges that had not been definitively resolved before President Biden took over and halted further construction on the border wall.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s team said it had developed a multifaceted plan to significantly increase the number of deportations, which it thought could be accomplished without new legislation from Congress, although it anticipated legal challenges.</p><p>Other elements of the team’s plan include bolstering the ranks of ICE officers with law enforcement officials who would be temporarily reassigned from other agencies, and with state National Guardsmen and federal troops activated to enforce the law on domestic soil <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/us/politics/trump-2025-insurrection-act.html" title="">under the Insurrection Act</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The team also plans to expand a form of due-process-free expulsions known as expedited removal, which is currently used near the border for recent arrivals, to people living across the interior of the country who cannot prove they have been in the United States for more than two years.</p><p>And the team plans to stop issuing citizenship-affirming documents, like passports and Social Security cards, to infants born on domestic soil to undocumented migrant parents in a bid to end birthright citizenship.</p><p>Mr. Trump has already signaled his intent to follow through on his promises with personnel announcements. He named <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump.html" title="">Mr. Miller</a> as a deputy chief of staff in his administration with influence over domestic policy. And Mr. Trump said he would make <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-homan-immigration-border.html" title="">Thomas Homan</a>, who ran ICE for the first year and a half of the Trump administration and was an early proponent of separating families to deter migrants, his administration’s “border czar.”</p><p>Mr. Homan told The New York Times in 2023 that he had met with Mr. Trump shortly after the now president-elect announced that he would seek office again. During that meeting, Mr. Homan said, he “agreed to come back” in a second term and would “help to organize and run the largest deportation operation this country’s ever seen.”</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Hamed Aleaziz<!-- -->, <!-- -->Eric Schmitt<!-- -->, <!-- -->Minho Kim<!-- --> and <!-- -->Karoun Demirjian<!-- -->.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Gold is a political correspondent for The Times covering the campaigns of Donald J.
