Trump’s cabinet looks like a rogues’ gallery of people with dubious credentials and questionable judgment.</p><p>His supporters see something different. </p><p>“It’s a masterpiece,’’ Eileen Margolis, 58, who lives in Weston, Fla., and owns a tattoo business, said of Mr. Trump’s cabinet picks unveiled over the past week. “If it was a painting, it would be a Picasso.”</p><p>A “brilliant alliance,’’ is how Joanne Warwick, 60, a former Democrat from Detroit, described many of the nominees.</p><p>“It’s pretty much a star cast,’’ said Judy Kanoui of Flat Rock, N.C., a retiree and lifelong Democrat who voted for Mr. Trump for the first time this month. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Democrats, and even some Republicans, worry that these nominees for top positions in government are inexperienced, conflicted and potentially reckless. But in interviews with almost two dozen Trump voters around the country, his supporters were more likely to describe them as mavericks and reformers recruited to deliver on Mr. Trump’s promise to shake up Washington.</p><p>In Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nominee for health and human services secretary, Mr. Trump’s supporters see a crusader searching for new solutions to chronic illnesses, not a conspiracy theorist promoting questionable and debunked ideas about vaccines and fluoride.</p><p>In Matt Gaetz, the nominee for attorney general, many Trump supporters look past the ethical investigation into allegations that he had a relationship with a 17-year-old girl and see a provocateur who is willing to punish the Democrats who unjustly prosecuted the president-elect.</p><p>“I think it’s so crazy, and I love it,’’ Merrill McCollum, 60, of Bozeman, Mont., said of the nominees.</p><p>Ms. McCollum said she voted for Mr. Trump after becoming frustrated by bureaucracy, identity politics and the rising cost of living. She is excited by his appointments of people she sees as outsiders to Washington, D.C., a place she got to know while working there during tours in naval intelligence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“What we’ve been doing in the past really hasn’t worked,’’ she added.</p><p>Not everyone is thrilled with every nominee. Some said the choice of Mr. Gaetz, a polarizing figure in both parties, could prove an unnecessary distraction and expressed doubts that he could be confirmed. Others thought the cabinet was not anti-establishment enough, pointing to Marco Rubio, the Florida senator who was tapped as secretary of state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-Elect Trump’s nominee to head the Department of Health and Human Services.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Brian Kozlowski, a 40-year-old lawyer in Orlando, said even after Mr. Trump’s resounding victory, his own expectations were relatively low that his candidate would be able to bring about lasting change in Washington. But the cabinet appointees have made him hopeful. </p><p>“It’s an actual fulfillment of a politician dispensing with the norms,” said Mr. Kozlowski. </p><p>“The No. 1 thing to me, and a lot of Trump voters, is getting rid of the swamp,’’ he added. “This is what is shocking some people — it may actually be happening.”</p><p>Among the nominees most praised in the interviews was Mr. Kennedy, who often speaks of addressing the rise in chronic health conditions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Many health experts are alarmed by Mr. Kennedy’s unfounded claims that vaccines cause autism and by his threats to sue medical journals and fire hundreds of employees at the National Institutes of Health. They fear that as health secretary, he could undo generations of sound public health policy.</p><p>But voters who support Mr. Trump said they admired Mr. Kennedy’s focus on environmental toxins and his break with his famous family over his unorthodox views. </p><p>David Dollar, 71, a home improvement contractor in Durham, N.C., said he appreciated Mr. Kennedy’s push to examine how corporate agricultural and food manufacturing affects Americans’ health. </p><p>“I see the epidemic of obesity in our country,” Mr. Dollar said. “I really appreciate Mr. Kennedy’s passion for trying to change these things.”</p><p>Ms. Warwick, the former Democrat from Detroit, said, “I bet there’s a bunch of people shaking in their boots” about Mr. Kennedy’s selection. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But in the end, she said, Democrats might like some of his policies.</p><p>Perhaps more than any other policy stance, Mr. Kennedy’s criticisms of vaccines resonated with Trump supporters, many of whom said they were still angry about the vaccine mandates and business and school shutdowns during the pandemic. They blamed them on President Biden, not Mr. Trump, who was president when the pandemic started.</p><p>The more criticism the cabinet nominees elicit, Trump voters said, the more it proves that Washington is scared of change.</p><p>Donna Hutz, 60, of Hubbard, Ohio, said she has been happy about every appointment announced so far, particularly Mr. Gaetz, a former Florida congressman who resigned last week after Mr. Trump announced his nomination. Ms. Hutz believes that the allegations against Mr. Gaetz are false, which makes her root for his success even more.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Matt Gaetz, who resigned from his seat in the House of Representatives, has been nominated to be attorney general.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The Justice Department under Mr. Biden declined to file charges in the case, and Mike Johnson, the House speaker, said he objected to releasing a report on an ethics committee’s investigation into the allegations because Mr. Gaetz resigned from Congress.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“It’s not what he’s done, it’s what was done to him,” said Ms. Hutz, a portfolio manager at an information technology company. </p><p>She said the backlash to some of Mr. Trump’s appointments does not surprise her, because in her view, his opponents have been blinded by the media. </p><p>“They’re losing it, and I’m enjoying every minute of it,” Ms. Hutz said of Mr. Trump’s critics. </p><p>Not all comments were unalloyed praise.</p><p>Ron Riggs, 65, a real estate broker in Torrance, Calif., said he thought Mr. Gaetz’s nomination was counterproductive, even though he could understand why Mr. Trump might want a loyalist in that position.</p><p>“It’ll bring drama and things to the surface that aren’t needed,” Mr. Riggs said. “This country has been so separated for so long, and we need a smooth pathway to get things done.” </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Some worried that the cabinet would not work quickly enough to end the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. Cole Graham, 30, took issue with the selections of Mr. Rubio and Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host who was tapped to run the Pentagon.</p><p>Mr. Graham, who lives in Arizona, said those men appeared “too war hawkish.” </p><p>“I do not support further encroachment of Israel into Gaza or into the West Bank,” he said. “I was hoping we might be able to take a step back.”</p><p>One supporter was pleased with the appointees not just for partisan reasons. Mike Netter, 67, who lives in Los Angeles County and who during the pandemic helped lead a recall attempt against Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, said he was drawn to the relative youth of nominees like Mr. Gaetz, Mr. Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard — a former Democratic congresswoman and nominee for national intelligence director — who are all under the age of 50.</p><p>The first thing Mr. Netter noticed when he looked at many of the nominees, he said, “was no gray hair.” </p><p>Emily Cochrane<!-- -->, <!-- -->Mitch Smith<!-- -->, <!-- -->Eduardo Medina<!-- -->, <!-- -->Christina Morales<!-- -->, <!-- -->Verónica Zaragovia<!-- --> and <!-- -->Eric Adelson<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Corkery covers national issues such as drug addiction, mental illness and violence and the people and places most affected by it.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-corkery">More about Michael Corkery</a></span></p></div><div><p>Shawn Hubler is based in Sacramento and covers California news, policy trends and personalities.
