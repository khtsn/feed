were put on administrative leave on Saturday night after refusing to give representatives of Elon Musk access to internal systems, according to three U.S. officials with knowledge of the matter.</p><p>And the agency’s chief of staff, Matt Hopson, a Trump administration political appointee who had started his job days ago, has resigned, two of the officials said.</p><p>John Voorhees, U.S.A.I.D.’s director of security, and his deputy are the latest senior officials at the agency to be put on administrative leave. Last week, Trump administration appointees suspended about 60 senior officials and fired hundreds of contractors. There has been talk among current and former agency employees and lawmakers that U.S.A.I.D., which receives its funding from Congress, could be subsumed within the State Department in a drastically reduced form as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-rubio-foreign-aid.html" title="">President Trump continues to slash foreign aid</a>.</p><p>The employees working for Mr. Musk’s task force who clashed with Mr. Voorhees and his deputy were seeking to enter a secure area of the agency’s offices to get at classified material, two U.S. officials with knowledge of the incident said. It is not clear exactly what exchange took place between them and Mr. Voorhees, who could not immediately be reached for comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Musk has posted a series of messages in recent days expressing fury at the aid agency and voicing conspiracy theories about it. </p><p>“USAID is a criminal organization,” Mr. Musk wrote on Sunday in a social media post that many aid workers saw as confirmation the agency would soon be absorbed into the State Department and that some viewed as a potential threat to their personal safety. “Time for it to die.”</p><p>Multiple people who identified themselves as representatives of Mr. Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency were on site at U.S.A.I.D. last week, demanding access to the agency’s financial and personnel records, according to two U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the activity and the agency’s inner workings.</p><p>The cost-cutting effort led by Mr. Musk, the world’s richest man, is not a department but rather a task force that nevertheless has been granted unusual power. An executive order signed by President Trump gives its workers unfettered access to government agencies. But in theory, the employees would still need to get proper security clearances to access classified material.</p><p>Katie Miller, an employee of the Musk initiative, <a href="https://x.com/katierosemiller/status/1886110659097637367" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">responded on Sunday to the reports of security officials being put on leave</a>. “No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances,” she said on X, the social media platform owned by Mr. Musk. The clash involving Mr. Voorhees was first <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/02/politics/usaid-officials-leave-musk-doge/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> by CNN on Sunday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>More employees from the agency were put on paid leave over the weekend, but exact numbers are unclear, the officials said. A sense of despair was settling in among employees remaining at U.S.A.I.D. as they learned of the new suspensions and braced for the potential of even more sweeping layoffs and a crippling of the agency.</p><p>U.S.A.I.D., which spent about $38.1 billion on health services, disaster relief, anti-poverty efforts and other foreign assistance programs in fiscal year 2023, makes up less than 1 percent of the federal budget. It takes foreign policy guidance from the State Department, but has otherwise operated independently. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/us-aid-agency-trump.html" title="">U.S.A.I.D. website went dark</a> on Saturday — a possible indication of a looming loss of the agency’s autonomy that employees anticipated Mr. Trump would soon make official with an executive order. Spokespeople for the White House did not immediately return a request for comment.</p><p>The State Department website has a page with archived posts from the aid agency.</p><p>Lawmakers and aid workers also learned that at least some of the signs at the agency’s headquarters had been removed.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/01/peter-marocco-trump-usaid" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pete Marocco</a>, a divisive figure from the first Trump administration, has taken charge of foreign aid at the State Department under Secretary of State Marco Rubio. He has been a leading figure in driving the halt to foreign aid, the firing and suspension of the U.S.A.I.D. employees, and the efforts of Mr. Musk’s representatives to get access to classified material at the agency, the officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The State Department and U.S.A.I.D. did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The changes underway have jarred nonprofit organizations that are supported by U.S.A.I.D. Those groups were already reeling from the Trump administration’s decision to freeze nearly all foreign aid programs, a move that was slightly modified by a subsequent vague waiver for programs that administer lifesaving humanitarian aid.</p><p>“An abrupt collapse of the agency would put the rights of millions of people around the world at greater risk as a result,” Paul O’Brien, the executive director of Amnesty International, said in a statement. “What dismantling USAID doesn’t do is make anyone safer or more prosperous. Congress should immediately step in to challenge this.”</p><p>Theodore Schleifer<!-- -->, <!-- -->Nicholas Nehamas<!-- --> and <!-- -->Stephanie Nolen<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Edward Wong reports on global affairs, U.S. foreign policy and the State Department.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/edward-wong">More about Edward Wong</a></span></p></div><div><p>Erica L.
