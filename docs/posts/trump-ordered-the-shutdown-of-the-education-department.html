    <h1>Trump Ordered the Shutdown of the Education Department</h1>

The president, flanked by children at school desks, said that his administration would “take all lawful steps to shut down the department,” adding: “It’s doing us no good.” The administration has cited poor test scores as a justification.</p><p>Whether the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/can-trump-dismantle-education-department.html" title="">department’s elimination will come to pass is unclear</a>. Congress created the agency, and only Congress has the power to dismantle it.</p><p>The order further weakens the agency after Trump slashed its work force by almost half, gutted its civil rights division and laid off research employees. Though, the department will retain a few critical functions, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/business/student-loans-education-department.html" title="">student loan and grant distribution</a>, special education funding and civil rights enforcement, the administration said.</p><p>Education leaders and advocacy groups have condemned the move. “This is a dark day for the millions of American children who depend on federal funding for a quality education,” said Derrick Johnson, president of the N.A.A.C.P.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Trump has framed the agency’s demise as a way to hand over education decisions to the states, but the Education Department doesn’t control local learning standards or reading lists. And the bulk of K-12 funding comes from state and local taxes.</p><p>In his speech today, Trump suggested he might push Congress for a vote on the issue, where Republicans could be faced with a predicament: please Trump or their constituents. Recent polls show that nearly two-thirds of voters oppose the department’s closure.</p><p><strong>In other education news, </strong>academics said that Trump’s ultimatum to Columbia was unparalleled, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/columbia-university-receivership-trump.html" title="">could upend colleges nationwide</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Judge James Boasberg issued an angrily written order to the Trump administration for an explanation about the deportation flights. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-21389c25">Judge sharply criticized Trump administration lawyers</h2><p>A federal judge in Washington ordered the Trump administration to explain its actions last weekend, when U.S. officials expelled scores of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador, despite his restraining order blocking the deportations.
