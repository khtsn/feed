    <h1>Revisiting the Harlem Renaissance</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>I’m a Brooklyn girl, but I’m low-key obsessed with the Harlem Renaissance. I’ve written a book about the era and taught its literature at universities. I can, and often do, spend whole weekends rereading Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston, listening to Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, thumbing through books featuring artwork by Aaron Douglas and Augusta Savage.</p><p>But what brings me back to the Renaissance again and again is the way it changed this country. When the movement started a century ago, the United States was finally creating our own distinctly original culture — songs and dances, paintings and novels. We were looking less to Europe as a model of creativity. And in this moment — the 1920s, in New York City, both uptown and downtown — we become more wholly American.</p><p>This year, a team of Times journalists marked the 100th anniversary of the Harlem Renaissance with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/arts/harlem-renaissance-100-anniversary.html" title="">a series examining its vibrant history</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A 1925 breakfast party for Langston Hughes.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, Photographs and Prints Division, The New York Public Library</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>We began with a little-known dinner party that took place on March 21, 1924, an unprecedented interracial gathering that included such luminaries as W.E.B. Du Bois, Carl Van Doren and Alain Locke, as well as up-and-coming writers like Gwendolyn Bennett and Countee Cullen.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Even today, in New York, this kind of gathering is rare. The purpose of the dinner was to marry talent to opportunity, connecting writers with editors and critics, and it was a wild success: In the decade after the dinner, Renaissance writers published more than 40 volumes of fiction, nonfiction and poetry, works that transformed the literary landscape of our nation. You can read about the dinner party (and the friendships, feuds and affairs that it launched) in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/arts/harlem-renaissance-dinner-1924-anniversary.html" title="">this piece</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Remixing Black dance.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Elliott Jerome Brown Jr. for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The Harlem Renaissance is not only a historical story. The 1920s were called the Jazz Age because the music, and the movements that it inspired, gave the decade a distinctly American groove, one that persists to this day. Imani Perry — who recently won the National Book Award for her work,<em> </em>“South to America: A Journey Below the Mason-Dixon to Understand the Soul of a Nation” — is also, as it turns out, a dance enthusiast. For our series, she interviewed three choreographers who are keeping the dance traditions of the Renaissance alive in their work. For days, the studios of The Times were filled with some of the finest dancers in the nation doing the lindy hop, swing and gravity-defying tap routines. You can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/03/arts/dance/harlem-renaissance-dance-100-anniversary.html" title="">see the results (and dance along) here, with stunning video and photography</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Harlem in the 1920s was a powerful space of sexual exploration and freedom. Many argue that the neighborhood was as important to the development of queer life in New York as the West Village was, in part because it offered queer men and women a chance to interact without the racial restrictions of the era. Working with The Times’s graphics team, we created <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/09/realestate/harlem-renaissance-lgbtq.html" title="">a map of queer Harlem</a>, one that you could open on your phone for a self-guided tour. It features places like Hamilton Lodge, which held drag balls going back to the 19th century; clubs where entertainers like Ma Rainey, Gladys Bentley and Jimmie Daniels performed; and homes where Alain Locke, Ethel Waters, Langston Hughes and so many others lived, loved and made art.</p><p>Years ago, Ann Douglas, author of “Terrible Honesty: Mongrel Manhattan in the 1920s,” a seminal text on the subject of New York in the 1920s, told The Times: “I have the unfashionable posture of loving my country. I don’t mean in the sense of the Pledge of Allegiance, but in that I believe America was founded on complex social, religious and political ideas and feelings, and that it is still the most exciting culture, the one where there is the most hope for the most people.” We invite you to read through these pieces, which represent a remarkable array of American ingenuity and creativity, a celebration of not only our past but all that is yet to come.</p><h2 id="link-187de1c">More from the series</h2><ul><li><p>During the Harlem Renaissance, some Black people hosted rent parties — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/28/realestate/rent-party-harlem-renaissance.html" title="">celebrations with an undercurrent of desperation</a> in the face of racism and discrimination.</p></li><li><p>Gwendolyn Bennett was a talented young poet and artist who was central to a fledgling cultural movement, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/obituaries/gwendolyn-bennett-harlem-renaissance-overlooked.html" title="">her life was shrouded by tragedy</a>.</p></li><li><p>The women who ran libraries during the Renaissance didn’t just build collections.

They supercharge the mind and help it see beyond what it can conceive on its own,” Noah writes in the introduction to this soothing picture book for all ages. Accompanied by Calvin and Hobbes-esque illustrations from Sabina Hahn, we follow a boy and a teddy bear beyond the confines of a gated yard into the wider world. Adventure awaits, as do lessons on connection, compromise and making peace while remaining true to who we are. Noah’s message couldn’t be more timely.</p><h3 id="link-420eedc"><span><strong>THE INTERVIEW</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Devin Oktar Yalkin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lulu-garcia-navarro"><img alt="Lulu Garcia-Navarro" title="Lulu Garcia-Navarro" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/29/reader-center/author-lulu-navarro-garcia/author-lulu-navarro-garcia-thumbLarge.png"/></a></p></div></div></div><p><em>This week’s subject for The Interview is Representative Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker, who was eager to move past the presidential election and dismissive of the idea that the result is a rebuke of the Democratic Party.</em></p><p><strong>When you look at what happened on Tuesday, you can see it in two ways. You can see that the country embraced Trump or you can see that they rejected the Democratic Party more broadly and the Biden-Harris administration. How do you see it?</strong></p><p>Well, I don’t see the Democratic Party more broadly. We lost two seats in the House, and we expect to pick up some more to offset that. Right now, we’re about even. So I don’t think whatever you said, with all due respect, applies to the House Democrats.</p><p><strong>House races are run very locally. They message specifically for their district.

So, your branding that we all got rejected, we didn’t. We’re still in the fight right now, and it’s going to be a very close call. I don’t see it as an outright rejection of the Democratic Party. Now, I do have a discomfort level with some of the Democrats right now who are saying, “Oh, we abandoned the working class.” No, we didn’t. That’s who we are.
