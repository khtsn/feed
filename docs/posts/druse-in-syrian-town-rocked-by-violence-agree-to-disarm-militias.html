We don’t want to be against the state.”</p><p>It was what the government had hoped to hear for months now, after rebels from Syria’s Sunni Muslim majority overthrew the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad in December. But many Syrians from the country’s many religious and ethnic minorities remain wary of their new leaders amid repeated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/world/middleeast/syria-alawite-massacre.html" title="">spasms of violence targeting minorities</a>, including the Druse.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>This week, a debunked audio clip purporting to be of a Druse cleric insulting the Prophet Muhammad incited Sunni extremists to attack Druse, including in Ashrafieh Sahnaya, south of Damascus, the capital. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/world/middleeast/syria-sectarian-violence-100-killed.html" title="">At least 101 people were killed</a>, including government forces, Druse fighters and civilians, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor.</p><p>In Ashrafieh Sahnaya, where different sects have long coexisted peacefully, mortars and shells crashed into buildings. Drones struck from the sky, and residents cowered indoors as local Druse militia fighters battled government forces and armed Sunni extremists.</p><p>The rebel coalition that toppled Mr. al-Assad included some Islamist extremist factions that remain outside central control, and that the Syrian authorities have shown little capacity to rein in.</p><p>Israel, whose government is close to the Israeli Druse minority, then intervened in the name of protecting Syrian Druse, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/middleeast/syria-sectarian-fighting-druse.html" title="">launching airstrikes</a> on Syrian government targets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A funeral procession for slain Druse fighters in Jaramana, Syria, on Wednesday.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>There are more than one million Druse across the Middle East, mostly in Syria and Lebanon, and some in Jordan and Israel.

Dispensing with the conciliatory tone of the others present, he accused pro-government forces of slaughtering civilians.</p><p>The officials at the meeting pleaded for patience.</p><p>“We are promising you a better life,” said Mr. Mudawwar, the government official. “What happens to you will happen to us. It’s the government’s duty to protect everyone.”</p><p>Some listeners bought it.</p><p>Saleh Makiki, Mr. Haj Ali’s nephew, said he had lost five relatives this week, including his father, a son and an uncle.

The government later released 32 local men detained during the clashes, satisfying a key Druse demand.</p><p>Outside the meeting hall, however, opinions were divided.</p><p>Across the street, Bahira Haj Ali, 42, leaned out her window to watch the sheikh, a relative, departing.</p><p>“It’s good we had the men to resist,” she said of the local Druse militias. “You can’t imagine the sounds we heard — shells, drones.” It was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/world/middleeast/syria-sectarian-attack-druse.html" title="">hard to trust</a> government forces, she said, though, she added, she might feel different if men from Ashrafieh Sahnaya joined.</p><p>As for Druse militias’ weapons, Ms. Haj Ali said: “This is our security.
