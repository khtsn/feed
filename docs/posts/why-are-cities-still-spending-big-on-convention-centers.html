There were 139,000 attendees this year compared with 182,000 in 2018. Fewer companies marketed their products at CES, too: 53,000 exhibitors at CES this year compared with 89,000 in 2018, according to data compiled by Heywood T. Sanders, an emeritus professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio and the author of the book “<a href="https://www.pennpress.org/9780812245776/convention-center-follies/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Convention Center Follies</a>.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“There are some headwinds out there,” said Amy Calvert, chief executive of the Events Industry Council. “To assume that we’re just going to go back to doing things the way we did them because it seemed to be safe, I think, would be a mistake.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Securing big gatherings is still an attractive source of revenue for large and midsize cities.

The Javits Center in New York completed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/nyregion/jacob-javits-center-expansion.html" title="">a $1.5 billion expansion</a> in 2021 that included an upgraded main hall and a seven-acre “<a href="https://www.javitscenter.com/sustainability/rooftop-habitats/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">green roof</a>” that features a farm and an apiary.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Convention centers are usually financed through bonds backed by hotel taxes paid by visitors.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ascertaining whether these projects live up to their promises is difficult, said Heywood T.

In Durham, N.C., which has a convention center, officials are planning to spend $315 million to build a new one, as well as an additional $225 million for <a href="https://www.wral.com/story/durham-leaders-consider-building-a-new-convention-center-expected-to-cost-nearly-315-million/21359703/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an adjoining hotel</a>.</p><p>Ascertaining whether these projects — usually financed through bonds backed by hotel taxes paid by visitors — live up to their promises is difficult, Dr. Sanders said, because most convention centers mask their losses and exaggerate their benefits.</p><p>Industry reports about the economic impact on convention centers often highlight full hotels and packed restaurants, he said, but “in my research and analysis, the conclusion is that kind of a result rarely happens.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Despite recent shocks and long-term trends, those who are bullish about the business say a successful convention center can act as both a landmark and an economic hub.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Changes in what companies and conference attendees want from convention centers have also shifted, shifting attention to areas for breaks and amenities outside the venue.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>The Connecticut Convention Center in Hartford <a href="https://crdact.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/10-13-2023-CTConventionCenter-FY2023-CBFS.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lost about $2 million a year</a> in 2022 and 2023, according to its financial statements. In Oakland, Calif., operators of the city’s convention center are asking for $1.7 million to keep the facility running, according to <a href="https://oaklandside.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/View-Report-2024-04-29T124328.118.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent memorandum</a> circulated to city officials.

Sherrif Karamat, president of the Professional Convention Management Association, an industry group, pointed to the convention center in Washington, D.C., which opened <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2004/12/19/dc-landmark-gone-in-a-cloud-of-dust/baaee2bf-97fb-48ea-b9f2-2d0fc89541d2/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in 2003</a>. He argued that the venue helped revive a swath of downtown by attracting hotels and high-end retailers including Apple.</p><p>Having “the right amount of activities and life around the building” is important, said Mr. Svedberg, who worked on the recent expansion of the Javits Center. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/us/nashville-party-vehicles.html" title="">Nashville</a>, the country music epicenter offering all types of cultural thrills, has been able to attract big conventions at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/21/realestate/commercial/nashville-gambles-on-appeal-of-new-623-million-convention-center.html" title="">Music City Center</a>, which opened in 2013.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Atlanta, the redesign project for the Georgia World Congress Center includes mixed-use retail and residential projects, said Sheba Ross, a partner at the architectural firm HKS and the lead designer for the project.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>In Atlanta, the redesign project for the Georgia World Congress Center, a 220-acre compound with four million square feet of interior space across three buildings, includes remaking a huge area of the downtown.

A neglected, overgrown thoroughfare fittingly named Gray Street would become, in her vision, a lively connector to the Georgia Tech campus. There would be a better path to Vine City, home to Atlanta’s esteemed historically Black colleges and universities, and to a spur of the city’s BeltLine park. The project could cost more than $1 billion, according to the Georgia World Congress Center Authority.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The redesign project for the Georgia World Congress Center, a 220-acre compound with 1.5 million square feet of interior space across three buildings, includes remaking a huge swath of downtown Atlanta. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Ross and others say overhauling and upgrading convention complexes can help transform them into vital additions to the urban landscape.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>If the push for bigger and better convention centers has long been fraught, Ms. Ross said the current shocks to the industry made this the perfect time to overhaul and upgrade aging complexes — transforming windowless fortresses that gobbled up city blocks, displacing small businesses and residents alike, into world-class structures that are vital to a city.</p><p>“There is this desire for the convention story to become the city’s story,” she said. “When people leave here and go back to Hong Kong, we don’t want them to remember a concrete box.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
