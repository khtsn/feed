Instead, fans reached for the digital payments platform Cash App, and some even dropped their handles across social media in hopes that someone would donate to their ticket funds.</p><p>Legacy brands aren’t the only banking options to come with such perks as early access to performances anymore.</p><p>For their Grand National tour, which will be debuting in the spring, SZA and Lamar partnered with <a href="https://x.com/CashApp/status/1863972563224838594" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cash App for early access</a>, the latest move by the payment platform to try to open up what has become an exclusive ticket-access process.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The “Grand National Tour” poster for the tour of Kendrick Lamar and SZA, featuring Cash App as one of the partners. </span></figcaption></figure></div><p>“Everyone should have access to the financial system, and that includes the rewards that come along with premium credit cards,” said Catherine Ferdon, the chief marketing officer for Cash App. “Most artists don’t really care what their fans’ credit score is or if they carry a luxury credit card in their wallet. They care that their fans love their music and can get access to it easily.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Generally, the credit cards that grant access for concert presales come with “pretty significant barriers to entry,” Ms. Ferdon said, including high annual fees, credit score requirements, and qualifying for a high credit limit. Cash App acts like a prepaid debit card and does not require users to have a bank account or credit approval. A physical Cash App card was required for the presale.</p><p>This would be the second tour for which Lamar has partnered with Cash App on ticket sales.</p><p><a href="https://www.fdic.gov/household-survey/2023-fdic-national-survey-unbanked-and-underbanked-households-report" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to the F.D.I.C.</a>, about one in six American households had no mainstream access to credit in 2023, and 4.2 percent of them — about 5.6 million households — were “unbanked,” meaning that no one in the household had a checking or savings account at a bank or credit union.</p><p>“This is just a really exciting way to bring more access to more people,” Ms. Ferdon said.</p><p>The partnership with Lamar and SZA allowed card users to unlock early access tickets for a day, as well as receive a 20 percent discount on merchandise purchased at the shows. Similar perks, including for food and drink, are made available for credit card holders at various arenas around the country. Tickets went on sale to the general public on Friday morning.</p><p>But the system is far from perfect.</p><p>Ahead of the presale, many social media users wondered <a href="https://x.com/_YFDF_/status/1864328001829085525" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">how much money to deposit into their Cash App accounts</a> (to account for processing time), while others complained about <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8N6FAX6/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">high ticket prices</a> and exorbitant processing fees, a common frustration among music fans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>And despite Cash App’s hope of inclusivity, many found tickets to be just as <a href="https://x.com/priM0E/status/1864322491079967148" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expensive</a> as many other presales. Some hoped the tickets would be discounted for early access, as other artists have done with presales.</p><p>Such was the case for <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8N6Jeba/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kiah Cyrus</a>, 23, who loaded $1,400 on her Cash App card to buy five tickets for herself and her family. All went smoothly until checkout, when she discovered the processing fees increased her total by $300.</p><p>“I couldn’t really process doing that,” she said.</p><p>Ticket prices vary by venue and seat location, and are set by the promoter and the ticketing sites of the tour, Ms. Ferdon said. Like many other major tours, tickets to the Lamar and SZA show were sold via Ticketmaster, whose parent company, Live Nation, is being sued by the Justice Department over claims that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/technology/ticketmaster-live-nation-lawsuit-antitrust.html" title="">it illegally maintained a monopoly</a> in the live entertainment industry.</p><p>Many recent top international tours partnered with major credit cards or banks — Taylor Swift’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/18/arts/music/taylor-swift-eras-tour-review.html" title="">Eras Tour</a>” partnered with Capital One; Beyoncé’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/09/arts/music/beyonce-renaissance-world-tour-review.html" title="">Renaissance World Tour</a>” with Citi; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/23/arts/music/harry-styles-love-on-tour-review.html" title="">Harry Styles</a> with American Express. Presales for some concerts are even limited to specific cards from the banks.</p><p>Cash App has a mixed reputation among some users, including Ms. Cyrus, who said she has had issues with money disappearing from her account and then receiving a refund for the missing funds. A judge is set to consider a proposed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/business/cash-app-settlement.html" title="">a $15 million settlement</a> related to a data breach involving Cash App’s payments and investment platform.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Cash App has partnered with other artists in recent years, including Sabrina Carpenter, Lil Nas X, Karol G and Drake (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/06/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-drake-explainer.html" title="">before the feud</a> with Lamar), artists whose audiences may overlap with the platform’s younger demographic, whose pockets may not be very deep.</p><p>“You don’t have to have a good credit score to be able to use Cash App, which is far more inclusive,” said Serona Elton, the director of the music industry program at the University of Miami. “I think there is a statement in there, an acknowledgment of meeting their fans where they are and not wanting to penalize their fans from being able to try their luck.”</p><p>By partnering with a specific credit card, artists could be putting some of their fans at a disadvantage, Ms. Elton said. “The last thing they want to do is alienate their fans and make it harder for their fans to get that opportunity to have an experience with them,” she said.</p><p>Cash App and musicians are bound to look at standard demographics — age, race, ethnicity and socioeconomic factors — to determine whether the partnership is a good match, Ms. Elton said.</p><p>Still, presales are going to presale: She said there would often be more demand than tickets, and the race to nab a seat is likely not going anywhere soon.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
