    <h1>Wall Street’s Slide Resumes as Tariff Anxiety Persists for Investors</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wall Street’s slide resumed on Thursday, another anxiety-induced drop that left the S&amp;P 500 brushing up against a “correction” — a symbolic marker of the speed at which investors have fled the stock market in recent weeks.</p><p>Traders, economists and business leaders have been grappling with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/business/trump-stock-market.html" title="">rapidly shifting economic landscape</a> as President Trump has imposed and threatened new tariffs on imports that could upend global trade and undermine complex supply chains for big companies.</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Trump threatened to impose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-tariff-european-union-whiskey.html" title="">200 percent tariffs on European wine and champagne</a>, one day after the European Union announced retaliatory tariffs on imports of U.S. whiskey and several other American products. The president has already added tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and a wide swath of products from China.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 fell more than 1 percent on Thursday, a drop that briefly left it about 10 percent below its Feb. 19 peak. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/stock-market-correction.html" title="">A drop of more than 10 percent</a> is called a correction, which on Wall Street serves as a signal that investors have turned pointedly more pessimistic about the market.</p></div></div>
