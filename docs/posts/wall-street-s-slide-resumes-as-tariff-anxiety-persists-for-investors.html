The president has already added tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and a wide swath of products from China.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 fell more than 1 percent on Thursday, a drop that briefly left it about 10 percent below its Feb. 19 peak. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/stock-market-correction.html" title="">A drop of more than 10 percent</a> is called a correction, which on Wall Street serves as a signal that investors have turned pointedly more pessimistic about the market.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The constantly moving goal posts have left investors so rattled that even recent good news about the economy hasn’t had a calming effect. On Thursday a report on weekly unemployment claims came in lower than expected. On Wednesday a better-than-expected reading of the Consumer Price Index had briefly helped bolster stocks.</p><p>Investors are worried that tariffs, once in full effect, will push prices higher — hurting business and consumers. Mr. Trump’s immigration policies and firings of federal employees through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency are also looming in the backdrop.</p><p>“The outlook for inflation depends more on tariffs, deportations and DOGE than the backward-looking data releases right now,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said on Thursday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-3"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Elon Musk’s Government Role</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>War on the I.R.S.: </strong>Italian employees who serve American forces at the Aviano Air Base in Italy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/world/europe/musk-email-italy-airbase.html">where workers’ rights are held sacrosanct</a>, got a familiar demand to list their achievements from Elon Musk, carrying with it the threat of termination if they did not respond.</p></li><li><p><strong>Musk’s Donations:</strong> Musk has signaled that he wants to put $100 million into groups controlled by the Trump political operation, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.
