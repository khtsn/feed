A long-distance Olympic runner died after she was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/sports/rebecca-cheptegei-dead-uganda-olympic-athlete.html" title="">severely burned</a> in a gasoline attack. And a mother, her daughter and her niece were tortured and then killed, their mutilated bodies disposed of in different locations.</p><p>A series of brutal murders in Kenya in recent months, documented by the police and human rights groups, has stunned a nation where anger over violence against women and girls has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/world/africa/femicide-kenya-africa.html" title="">prompted nationwide protests</a>. Calls are intensifying for the authorities to do more to stop the killings.</p><p>The police say that 97 women were murdered from August to October this year, a staggering toll even in Kenya, where femicide <a href="https://femicide.africauncensored.online/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has long been endemic</a>. In July, sacks containing the body parts of women believed to have been murdered by a serial killer were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/20/world/africa/nairobi-kenya-serial-killer.html" title="">discovered in a dump</a> in the capital, Nairobi.</p><p>On Tuesday, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Nairobi, demanding that the government take action to stop the killings. Smaller protests also took place in other towns and cities across the country, human rights groups said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In Nairobi, police tear-gassed demonstrators who had been chanting, “Stop killing women” and, “Women have rights, too.” At least three activists, including the executive director of Amnesty International Kenya, were detained, according to <a href="https://www.amnestykenya.org/joint-statement-by-amnesty-international-kenya-the-law-society-of-kenya-human-is-my-id-alliance-and-the-end-femicide-ke-movement/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> by several rights groups.</p><p>The outpouring of rage reflected the helplessness felt by many women in Kenya, and the desire to get justice for those who have been killed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photograph of Seth Nyakio, 23, who was sexually assaulted and strangled to death in October in Thika, a town about 25 miles northeast of Nairobi.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brian Otieno for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The dead can’t talk. So who is going to tell the truth and stand up for them?” said Lucy Njeri Mwaniki. Her 23-year-old daughter and only child, Seth Nyakio, was raped and strangled to death in October in an apartment in Thika, a town about 25 miles northeast of Nairobi. The former boyfriend of one of her friends is being sought by the police as the prime suspect.</p><p>The spike in killings in Kenya, researchers say, is linked to economic disparities and deeply ingrained patriarchal attitudes that deny women autonomy. On social media, victims are often blamed for how they were dressed or for their lifestyles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The femicides in Kenya reflect a wider problem across Africa.</p><p>Over 21,000 gender-related killings of women were <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2024/11/femicides-in-2023-global-estimates-of-intimate-partner-family-member-femicides" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">documented in Africa</a> in 2023, the highest rate in the world, according to a United Nations report in November. Observers say the true numbers are much higher. Femicide is usually committed by male family members or intimate partners, experts say, and many victims are also subjected to physical, sexual and psychological abuse.</p><p>After months of withering criticism, Kenya’s president, William Ruto, last month <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1254800758898339" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acknowledged</a> that femicide was “a pressing and deeply troubling issue.” His administration, he said, would allocate about $770,000 to a campaign aimed at protecting and supporting victims — a sum that activists said fell far short of what was needed.</p><p>Rights groups have called on Mr. Ruto to declare femicide a national crisis and to dedicate more money to raise awareness of the issue. They also want Parliament, where Mr. Ruto’s coalition holds a majority, to enact a law that creates a special category of crime to address gender-motivated killings, imposing harsh penalties for perpetrators.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Roy Frank Chege, 13, holds a photo of Ivy Wairimu Chege, 20, his sister who fell to her death this year.

For instance, the suspect who was arrested and accused of murdering and dumping the women at the Nairobi garbage site later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/world/africa/kenya-serial-killer-suspect-escape.html" title="">escaped custody</a>. According to the police, officers may have helped him break out.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“We have lost so many women, yet femicide is not taken seriously,” said Caroline Chege, whose 20-year-old daughter, Ivy Wairimu Chege, died in March after falling from the sixth floor of a building in Juja, a town about 20 miles east of the capital. She said she believed that her daughter had been murdered, citing video footage that showed her arguing with a group of men and a woman before her fall. No one has been arrested in the case, she said.</p><p>“Every day feels like the end of the world,” Ms. Chege added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Zaha Indimuli, an activist involved in organizing the recent protests, at an event in Nairobi to promote awareness of femicide.

They were “best friends,” she said, running errands together and going shopping.</p><p>In mid-October, Ms. Nyakio went to spend the night at a friend’s house. When Ms. Nyakio failed to return home the next day and did not respond to texts or answer phone calls, Ms. Mwaniki became alarmed.</p><p>The police later found Ms. Nyakio’s body at her friend’s apartment. Ms. Mwaniki accused the police of dragging their heels on the case, claiming that it was only when her family used its political connections that officers finally looked for suspects and took statements.</p><p>She said that her daughter’s clothes had not been secured as evidence and that she had found them unattended and wet at the police station.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the Kenyan police did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Ms. Mwaniki said that she often stared at men in the street, wondering if one of them was her daughter’s killer.
