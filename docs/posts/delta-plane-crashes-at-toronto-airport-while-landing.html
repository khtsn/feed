    <h1>Delta Plane Crashes at Toronto Airport While Landing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A Delta Air Lines jet attempting to land at Toronto Pearson Airport amid strong winds and drifting snow crashed and flipped over on the tarmac on Monday afternoon, finally coming to a rest with its belly up and with at least one wing shorn off.</p><p>Despite the aircraft’s dramatic landing, all 80 people aboard the plane, Flight 4819 from Minneapolis, were evacuated.</p><div><p>Photos and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=609662195030851" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> showed passengers coming down the plane’s front and rear doors and walking away on the snow-covered tarmac as firefighters hosed down the aircraft.</p><p>At least 18 people were injured, according to Delta. They included one person with critical but not life-threatening injuries who was airlifted to a trauma center, and a child who was in critical but non-life-threatening condition.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Delta flight, with 80 people aboard, crashed and flipped over while landing  at Toronto Pearson International Airport on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ian Willms for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The remaining people who were injured were taken to hospitals with minor-to-moderate injuries. Officials said 22 of the passengers were Canadians and the rest were from other countries.</p><p>Videos taken at the scene showed flames and black smoke billowing from the crash and firefighters spraying the plane’s fuselage while passengers evacuated the overturned aircraft.</p><p>Pete Koukov, who was on the flight, said in an interview with CNN that he “didn’t know anything was the matter” until the plane hit the ground in what he described as a pretty hard landing.</p><p>“We hit the ground, and we were sideways, and then we were upside down hanging like bats,” Mr. Koukov told CNN’s Brianna Keilar.</p><p>The crash landing in Toronto comes nearly three weeks after another regional jet, operated by American Airlines, crashed in the Potomac River in Washington, after being hit by a U.S. Army helicopter, leaving no survivors.</p><p>In Canada, the Delta plane — a CRJ-900 built by Bombardier and operated by a Delta subsidiary, Endeavor Air — crashed while landing around 2:45 p.m. local time, Federal Aviation Administration officials said in a statement.</p><p>According to the weather service of Environment Canada, there were strong winds coming from the west at about 29 miles per hour, with gusts of up to 38 m.p.h., at the time of the crash. The weather service also reported drifting snow in Toronto, which, like much of Ontario, was hit with two snowstorms in the past few days.</p><p>Airport officials had said earlier in the day that they were <a href="https://x.com/TorontoPearson/status/1891459206932209806" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expecting “a busy day”</a> as airlines caught up after the back-to-back snowstorms, including a weekend snowstorm that <a href="https://x.com/TorontoPearson/status/1891507105208655897" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dumped more than eight inches of snow</a>.</p><p>A small fleet of orange snow removal machines worked to clear the runways just before sunset on Monday.</p><p>In a statement, Delta <a href="https://x.com/DeltaNewsHub/status/1891590751147933915" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> it was aware of reports of the crash and was “working to confirm any details.” The Transportation Safety Board of Canada will lead the investigation, officials said.</p><p>Announcements over the intercom at the airport’s crowded departure hall warned of operational delays as passengers were stalled at the check in line on Monday afternoon.</p><p>“It’s a little bit of a logistical nightmare,’’ said Teresa Norris, who was trying to fly home to Montreal.</p><p>By 5 p.m., arrivals and departures had resumed at the airport, and all 80 onboard, including 76 passengers and four crew members, had been accounted for, according to the airport authorities.</p><p>Endeavor Air, the Delta subsidiary, typically runs smaller planes on shorter routes for its parent airline.</p><p>Endeavor’s fleet includes about 120 Bombardier CRJ-900s. Those aircraft are configured with 70 or 76 seats.</p><p>The aircraft is about 16 years old, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. With regular maintenance, such passenger jets are often operated for two to three decades, or more.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Deborah Ale Flint, the president and chief executive of the Greater Toronto Airports Authority, at a news conference after the plane crash on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ian Willms for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>There are more than 380 CRJ-900s in use by airlines around the world, according to Cirium, an aviation data company. The aircraft, which has been in operation for more than two decades, has a solid safety record, according to Cirium data.</p><p>The crash on Monday added to a spate of aviation accidents that have rattled travelers in recent weeks.</p><p>On Jan. 29, an Army Black Hawk helicopter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/plane-crash-dc-helicopter-reagan-airport.html" title="">collided with an American Airlines regional jet</a> that was on its final approach to Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, killing all 67 people on both aircraft.</p><p>The helicopter was on a training mission and was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/plane-helicopter-crash-reagan-airport.html" title="">flying about 100 feet higher than authorized</a> at the time of the collision, the nation’s deadliest aviation accident since 2009.</p><p>Two days later, a small medical plane carrying six people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/plane-crash-philadelphia-roosevelt-mall.html" title="">crashed near a shopping center in Northeast Philadelphia</a>, killing all on board and one person on the ground.</p><p>On Feb. 2, a Delta flight from Minneapolis to Amsterdam returned to the Twin Cities because of a problem with the plane’s flaps, the television station <a href="https://kstp.com/kstp-news/local-news/delta-flight-heading-to-amsterdam-from-msp-diverts-back-to-airport-an-hour-after-takeoff/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KSTP reported</a>. There were 272 passengers on that flight.</p><p>On Feb. 5, a Japan Airlines plane <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/delta-japan-airlines-collision-seattle-airport.html" title="">clipped a parked Delta Air Lines plane</a> while taxiing at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, impaling the tail of the Delta jet. No injuries were reported.</p><p>Ian Austen<!-- -->, <!-- -->Neil Vigdor<!-- --> and <!-- -->Niraj Chokshi<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div>
