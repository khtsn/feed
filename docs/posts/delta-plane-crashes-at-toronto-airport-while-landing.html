Anita Anand, Canada’s transportation minister, <a href="https://x.com/AnitaAnandMP/status/1891585973391085993" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a> that she was “closely following the serious incident.”</p><p>According to the weather service of Environment Canada, there were strong winds coming from the west at about 29 miles per hour, with gusts of up to 38 m.p.h., at the time of the crash. It also reported drifting snow. Temperatures in Toronto were expected to reach a high of only 20 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday.</p><p>The airport said earlier in the day that it was <a href="https://x.com/TorontoPearson/status/1891459206932209806" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expecting “a busy day”</a> as airlines caught up after back-to-back snowstorms, including a weekend snowstorm that <a href="https://x.com/TorontoPearson/status/1891507105208655897" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dumped more than eight inches of snow</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The flight was operated by a Delta subsidiary, Endeavor Air, which typically runs smaller planes on shorter routes for its parent airline.</p><p>Endeavor’s fleet includes about 120 Bombardier CRJ-900s, the type of plane involved in the crash on Monday. Those aircraft are configured with 70 or 76 seats.</p><p>The aircraft is about 16 years old, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. With regular maintenance, such passenger jets are often operated for two to three decades, or more.</p><p>There are more than 380 CRJ-900s in use by airlines around the world, according to Cirium. The aircraft, which has been in operation for more than two decades, has a solid safety record, according to Cirium data.</p><p>An air traffic controller advised another inbound flight about the emergency shortly after the plane overturned, according to an audio transmission.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“We just had a crash on runway 23 here,” he said.</p><p>Ian Austen<!-- -->, <!-- -->Niraj Chokshi<!-- --> and <!-- -->Neil Vigdor<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-9"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Remy Tumin is a reporter for The Times covering breaking news and other topics.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/remy-tumin">More about Remy Tumin</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/delta-air-lines-inc">Delta Air Lines, Inc.</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Toast, Trees and a Wassailing Queen: </strong>The centuries-old tradition is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/world/europe/england-wassailing-cider-tradition.html">making a comeback in rural England</a>, with rituals and revelry meant to chase away evil spirits and the winter blues.</p></li><li><p><strong>How Venezuela Helps Fuel Colombian Violence:</strong> A decades-old rebel group <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/americas/venezuela-colombia-violence.html">has waged the worst violence in Colombia in a generation</a>, setting off troubling regional tensions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Women Lead a Democratic Revival: </strong>A leftist movement<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/world/asia/sri-lanka-politics-women.html"> that took power in Sri Lanka after an economic collapse</a> is seizing a rare opportunity to rally more women into politics.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Dark Side of a Lobster Fight: </strong>As Canada wrangles <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/world/canada/nova-scotia-canada-lobster.html">an epic, decades-long saga</a> of who can fish for lobster, and when, emerging threats are heating up the conflict in Nova Scotia.</p></li><li><p><strong>Where Divinity and Politics Meet:</strong><strong> </strong>The Maha Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival in India that is drawing hundreds of millions of pilgrims, is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/world/asia/india-maha-kumbh-mela.html">powerful marketing tool for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his allies</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
