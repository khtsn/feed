Ms. McIver has maintained her innocence and dismissed the charges as “political intimidation.”</p><p>On Wednesday, after a South Carolina Republican filed a resolution to expel her from the House, Ms. McIver responded with defiance: “In the South I think they say, ‘bless her heart,’” she wrote on <a href="https://x.com/RepLaMonica/status/1925279216918028563" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a>.</p><p>Ms McIver’s unflinching stance in the face of charges that carry a potential penalty of 16 years in prison surprised no one who knows her well in Newark, New Jersey’s largest city, where she was raised in a public housing high-rise and rose to become president of the city council.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The oldest of four children, with a mother who struggled with addiction, Ms. McIver, 38, said she had no choice but to grow up fast and strong.</p><p>“I have had to be a leader for a very long time,” she said in an interview. Her mother, now sober for 15 years, has worked for her at City Hall and is among her closest aides.</p><p>It was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/nyregion/ras-baraka-newark-ice-trespassing.html" title="">Ras Baraka</a> — now the city’s mayor and a Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor — who helped to steer Ms. McIver away from trouble and toward politics, the congresswoman said.</p><p>Mr. Baraka began his career as a teacher and principal, and Ms. McIver was a student in his fifth-grade class. He encouraged her to join the middle school’s drama club, where she landed a role in Shakespeare’s “Macbeth.” As a student, she helped to hand out fliers when he ran for city council.</p><p>He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/14/nyregion/new-faces-put-spark-in-newark-election.html" title="">lost</a>, but she was hooked. “Passing out literature, asking if people were registered to vote — I loved that,” Ms. McIver said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In 2018, she ran against eight opponents for city council. In a runoff, she won by <a href="https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/NJ/Essex/75962/Web02.203317/#/cid/3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">362</a> votes.</p><p>Mr. Baraka, who has continued to play a key role in shepherding her career, said Ms. McIver’s work ethic and hardscrabble upbringing had prepared her well to use her position “to protect the most vulnerable.”</p><p>“I don’t know if anyone can outwork her,” he said.</p><p>Last year, after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/nyregion/rep-donald-m-payne-jr-dead.html" title="">Representative Donald M. Payne Jr.</a> died during his sixth term in Washington, Ms. McIver competed in a special election for his seat in New Jersey’s 10th Congressional District and won, fulfilling a long-held dream. She was elected in November to a two-year term.</p><p>“She grew up in the city of Newark through trying and difficult situations,” said LeRoy J. Jones Jr., chairman of the state’s Democratic Party and its branch in Essex County, which includes Newark. “A lot of people don’t make it out of that. She made it out. That’s where the exceptional side of her comes.”</p><p>After becoming president of the city council in 2022, Ms. McIver earned a reputation for her no-nonsense style, often barring speakers from meetings for a month if they cursed, yelled or refused to sit down after their allotted time had ended.</p><p>“She’s a tough cookie,” said Trenton Jones, who has worked as a <a href="https://www.insidernj.com/going-out-haircut-20-years-later-candidacy-trenton-jones/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">legislative aide</a> in Newark’s City Hall and in 2022 lost a city council race to a candidate backed by Mr. Baraka and Ms. McIver. “She doesn’t have a problem saying what she wants to say.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>During Ms. McIver’s term as president, the council approved a bill that allows 16- and 17-year-olds to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/10/nyregion/newark-voting-age.html" title="">vote in school board elections</a>, joining a handful of other communities in the United States. The governor has since proposed expanding the initiative throughout New Jersey, but April’s low turnout in Newark — only 73 of the 1,851 newly registered teenagers cast ballots, according to <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/newark/2025/05/09/less-than-four-percent-of-teens-vote-in-2025-school-board-election/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chalkbeat Newark</a> — has raised questions about its merits.</p><p>Long before she was in the cross hairs of federal prosecutors, Ms. McIver, who has a 9-year-old daughter, said she hoped to bring a fresh voice to a Congress filled mainly with older representatives.</p><p>“Many people in Congress — their kids are grown,” she said in an interview on Election Day. “There’s not a lot of young mamas there who are trying to tell you what a gallon of milk costs, what food is costing, how child care is impacting them.”</p><p>It was a concern about those at the margins of society that she said led her to join two of her congressional colleagues for a May 9 oversight visit to Delaney Hall, a large <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/nyregion/trump-deportation-facility-newark.html" title="">migrant detention center in Newark run by a private prison company</a>. Mr. Baraka tried to accompany them and was initially allowed inside the facility’s gated perimeter but not inside the building. Later, he was told to leave altogether.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Ms. McIver was outside when immigration agents, wearing masks and camouflage gear, moved in to arrest Mr. Baraka on trespassing charges, leading to a volatile and confused onrush just outside the jail’s perimeter. Video of the scrum showed her pushing toward the gates and being pushed from behind after Mr. Baraka was handcuffed. The government accused her of assaulting two federal agents.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-11"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/16/us/politics/newark-arrest-footage-cover/newark-arrest-footage-cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>NJ PBS/NJ Spotlight News, via X</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In a news release announcing the charges against Ms. McIver, Alina Habba, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, who previously defended Mr. Trump in civil trials and served as a campaign spokeswoman, wrote, “No one is above the law — politicians or otherwise.”</p><p>Ms. Habba revealed in the same news release that she would drop the case against Mr. Baraka — a development that led a federal judge to harshly reprimand prosecutors for what he called a “hasty arrest.”</p><p>“An arrest, particularly of a public figure, is not a preliminary investigative tool,” the judge, André M. Espinosa, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/23/us/mayor-baraka-judge-dismissal.html" title="">said in court</a>. “It is a severe action, carrying significant reputational and personal consequences, and it should only be undertaken after a thorough, dispassionate evaluation of credible evidence.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-13"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/23/us/mayor-baraka-judge-dismissal.html"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/23/doc-ecde599b-4566-4fc9-9d2a-c-promo/doc-ecde599b-4566-4fc9-9d2a-c-promo-articleLarge.png" alt="Thumbnail of page 1"/></a></p><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/23/us/mayor-baraka-judge-dismissal.html"><h2>Read the document</h2></a><p>Magistrate Judge André Espinosa of U.S. District Court reprimanded federal prosecutors in New Jersey before agreeing to dismiss trespassing charges against Ras J.

The charges also call into question a constitutional protection known as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/24/us/lindsey-graham-speech-debate-clause-supreme-court.html" title="">“speech or debate” clause</a>, which offers federal lawmakers a broad degree of protection from criminal penalties that stem from actions taken while performing <a href="https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention/iceFacilityVisitationCongressional.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">legislative duties</a>.</p><p>Congressional historians, when asked to identify any similar charges against a House member, had to reach back centuries, to 1799, when <a href="https://history.house.gov/HistoricalHighlight/Detail/36323" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Representative Matthew Lyon</a> of Vermont was <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/a-look-back-sedition-free-speech-and-the-president" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imprisoned for violating the recently passed Sedition Act</a>. Mr. Lyon had criticized President John Adams in print and in front of crowds and accused him of having “an unbounded thirst for ridiculous pomp.”</p><p>Ms. McIver has hired two of the state’s most prominent former federal prosecutors to represent her. One of them, Paul J. Fishman, served for roughly eight years in the role Ms. Habba now has as U.S. attorney.</p><p>“It’s an expensive battle,” she acknowledged about the cost of defending herself.</p><p>Before entering Congress, Ms. McIver worked in human resources in higher education. She was the first person in her family to attend college or graduate school and has as much as $250,000 in student loan debt, according to a recent financial disclosure form. Colleagues in Congress have been broadly sharing a text message Ms. McIver sent to supporters that seeks “a $10 donation or whatever feels right to help me have what it takes to fight back.”</p><p>The charges may also carry a steep political price as Republicans move to censure her or expel her from a seat she has held for less than a year. Last week, in Ms. McIver’s congressional district, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/nyregion/new-jersey-congress-ice-mciver.html" title="">reaction from her constituents</a> was mixed, suggesting that the charges could affect her re-election odds next year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>It is common for federal prosecutors to take months to build a case, issuing subpoenas and interviewing witnesses before announcing charges or an indictment. Ms. McIver, however, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.569115/gov.uscourts.njd.569115.1.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was charged</a> 10 days after the clash at the detention center.</p><p>In the days beforehand, a social media account tied to Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJe-sQivwiT/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted a message</a>: “UNBELIEVABLE! New footage shows Democrat Congresswoman, LaMonica McIver ASSAULTING an ICE agent.”</p><p>Ms. McIver appeared on Wednesday for an initial court hearing by video conference from Washington. She was told to surrender any guns she might own and that she must request authorization for certain personal travel. Her next court date is set for June 11.</p><p>Mr. Fishman, in a statement, has called the charges “spectacularly inappropriate.”</p><p>“In the courtroom, facts — not headlines — will matter,” he said.</p><p>Kirsten Noyes<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tracey Tully is a reporter for The Times who covers New Jersey, where she has lived for more than 20 years.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>13</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>‘Jersey Girl’ In Congress Readies Case After a Clash<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
