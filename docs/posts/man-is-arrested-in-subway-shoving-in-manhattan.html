He said he had moved to the city in 1974 and was not surprised that someone had been shoved in front of a moving train there.</p><p>“There’s a real sense of more than just kind of precautionary sensibilities,” he said of the general mood he detected among passengers these days. “There starts to become an embedded fear. And that’s not good for the city or the riders in general.”</p><p>Mr. Roberts said he felt that many of those who committed violent acts in the subway were seriously troubled and unable to get the care they needed. “They just need to be removed” from the system and put in a facility of some kind, he said.</p><p>“You could be laissez-faire about things,” he said, “but at a certain point, public safety, quality of life and these issues start to come to the forefront. And if that starts to deteriorate, the city as it is, is just going to fall.”</p><p>A short time later, Steven Schmatz and Riyu Banerjee got off an uptown train at the station, which is close to Mr. Schmatz’s home. They said they just been talking about the shoving attack and were shocked to learned that it had happened at 18th Street.</p><p>“I’ve never felt unsafe here,” Mr. Schmatz said. “That’s crazy.”</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve seen any major incidents since I’ve lived in New York for the past seven years,” he added. “I’ve seen antisocial behavior, but I haven’t seen anything super dangerous. It does seem like there’s been an uptick recently.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alyce McFadden is a reporter covering New York City and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alyce-mcfadden">More about Alyce McFadden</a></span></p></div><div><p>Chelsia Rose Marcius is a criminal justice reporter for The Times, covering the New York Police Department.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/chelsia-rose-marcius">More about Chelsia Rose Marcius</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/ny-metropolitan-transportation-authority">N.Y.
