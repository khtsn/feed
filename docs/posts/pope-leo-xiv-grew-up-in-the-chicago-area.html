William Lego on the South Side of Chicago, who was watching television in his office when the new pope was announced, he was his old friend Bob. </p><p>“They picked a good man,” said Father Lego, the pastor of St. Turibius Parish, who has known the new pope since their high school days. “He had a good sense of right and wrong, always working with the poor.”<span>  </span></p><p>The new pope, who was born Robert Francis Prevost, hails from the Chicago area, where he grew up in a southern suburb just outside of the city. </p><p>His family belonged to the now-shuttered St. Mary of the Assumption Parish in the Riverdale neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago, then populated by throngs of Catholic families. His father, Louis Prevost, was a school superintendent in Chicago Heights, a suburb in Cook County. His mother, Mildred Prevost, was a librarian and deeply involved in parish life, serving as the president of the St. Mary Altar Rosary Society, according to her death notice in 1990. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Noelle Neis remembers sitting behind the Prevost family every Sunday at 9:15 a.m. Mass as a child at St. Mary’s. </p><p>“You’d kind of always go to the same Mass and file in the same pew,” said Ms. Neis, 69, who lives in the Chicago suburbs. “They were always there.”</p><p>By the time the newly elected pope reached adolescence, he was looking toward the priesthood, enrolling in St. Augustine Seminary High School in Holland, Mich., a boarding school for boys. </p><p>There, he lived in the Augustinian tradition, with its intense focus on community: eating together, studying together, sharing everything about their lives. </p><p>The new pope then studied at Villanova University in Pennsylvania, earning a Bachelor of Science in mathematics in 1977, before returning to Chicago to attend Catholic Theological Union, a graduate school, and earn a divinity degree. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Archdiocese of Chicago serves roughly two million Catholics in Cook and Lake Counties, about one-third of the counties’ population. </p><p>In Chicago, as word began to spread that the new pope was one of their own, Catholics said they were thrilled — and a touch overwhelmed. </p><p>“Not only is he an American, but he is from Chicago,” said Veronica Cervantes, a 52-year-old executive recruiter. “That right there is shocking.” </p><p>Mitch Smith<!-- --> and <!-- -->Robert Chiarito<!-- --> contributed reporting. <!-- -->Susan C.
