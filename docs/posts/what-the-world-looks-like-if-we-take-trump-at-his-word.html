Aaron</a>, an economist at the Brookings Institution, sent his criticism of the Trump agenda by email:</p><blockquote><p>Take the across-the-board tariff. It would injure American consumers by jacking up prices not only directly but also indirectly by lessening foreign competition and would injure export industries through exchange rate effects that increase the price of American goods to foreign buyers.</p></blockquote><p>In addition, Aaron wrote, Trump proposes</p><blockquote><p>to give the White House greater influence over monetary policy. This idea is genuinely frightening, as the political interests of incumbent politicians often diverge from the imperatives of sound monetary policy, especially in election years. Trump is reminiscent of Juan Perón, who converted Argentina from a country richer than France, Germany or England into a poverty-ridden, inflation-crippled middle-income nation, in no small part by forcing his Treasury to print money to pay for his whims.</p></blockquote><p>With that for a starter, let’s take a deeper look at Trump’s plan to raise import duties — i.e., tariffs — and his plan to make his 2017 tax cuts permanent.</p><p><a href="https://economics.harvard.edu/people/jason-furman" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jason Furman</a>, an economist at Harvard and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration, warned in an email, “If Trump follows through on his campaign commitment to across-the-board tariffs, something he could do unilaterally without congressional approval, the result would be the worst global trade war since the Great Depression.”</p><p><a href="https://econ.columbia.edu/econpeople/david-weinstein/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Weinstein</a>, an economist at Columbia and an expert in trade policy, responded to my inquiry by email, providing a detailed analysis of the effect of the tariffs that were adopted during Trump’s first term in office.</p><p>“Tariffs are taxes that raise the price of imports,” Weinstein wrote, noting that he and his co-authors “found that U.S. import prices rose approximately one for one with the tariffs that the U.S. imposed on China in 2018 and 2019.”</p><p>The tariff-induced price hikes, Weinstein continued,</p><blockquote><p>are likely to affect low-income households disproportionately. There is <a href="https://akhandelwal8.github.io/files/qje_MUGFT/MUGFT.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">substantial evidence</a> that low-income families spend a higher fraction of their income on tradable goods, largely because rich households tend to spend more on nontradable goods and services (like second homes, vacations, country-club memberships, etc.).</p></blockquote><p>In this context, Trump’s proposed 60 percent tariff on Chinese imports would be particularly hard on low-income Americans. Weinstein noted that “tariffs on Chinese products tend to take a bigger bite out of the incomes of poorer households because items like Chinese electronics and toys constitute a larger fraction of their expenditures.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The imposition of tariffs in the last decade, Weinstein pointed out, also had a negative impact on the stock market:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/vrhw81086krt84ayuvxes/AGKW-NBER-Paper-w28758.pdf?rlkey=lxifbub05b1apkp7fx55cfzdu&amp;dl=0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In some recent work</a>, we have looked at the effects of the Trump tariffs and the resulting Chinese retaliation on stock prices. Stock markets reacted strongly and negatively to U.S. and Chinese tariff announcements, cumulatively dropping a whopping 11.5 percent (or $4.12 trillion) on days in which there were tariff announcements.</p></blockquote><p>As a result, Weinstein wrote, he and his colleagues</p><blockquote><p>estimate that U.S. income will be 3 percent lower due to the trade war. One natural interpretation for why stock markets think that the trade war was a much bigger event than is suggested by conventional models is that the damage to the world trading system wrought by the trade war in conjunction with the reorganization of global value chains from one based on efficiency to one based on politics and national security is likely to be very costly in the long run.</p></blockquote><p>The nonpartisan <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/tpc-trump-tariffs-would-raise-household-taxes-and-slow-imports" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tax Policy Center</a> analyzed the distributional gains and losses for both Trump’s proposed <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/make-certain-provisions-2017-tax-act-permanent-july-2024/t24-0025-make-certain" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tax plan</a>, which would permanently reduce individual liabilities and <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/biden-and-trump-tariffs-august-2024/t24-0050-enact-60-percent-tariff-imports-china" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his tariff plan</a>, which would push up consumer costs as importers raise prices to account for the government levy.</p><p>According to the center, Trump’s planned tax cut would provide far more benefit to the affluent than to everyone else. Those in the bottom, second, middle and fourth quintiles would get annual tax cuts of $130, $480, $1,030 and $1,930.</p><p>Those in the top 1 percent would get a $70,350 reduction in their tax burdens, and those in the top 0.1 percent would get $278,240.</p><p>But what happens when the rising costs of consumer goods that would very likely result from Trump’s tariffs are taken into account?</p><p>Costs for those in the bottom four quintiles would rise to $320, $750, $1,350 and $2,250, according to the Tax Policy Center.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In effect, 80 percent of us would turn into net losers.</p><p>Studies conducted by the <a href="https://www.piie.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Peterson Institute for International Economics</a>, a nonpartisan think tank, generally support the Tax Policy Center’s analysis of the Trump tariffs.</p><p><a href="https://www.piie.com/experts/senior-research-staff/kimberly-clausing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kimberly Clausing</a> and <a href="https://www.piie.com/experts/senior-research-staff/mary-e-lovely" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mary E. Lovely</a>, senior fellows at the institute, contended in their May policy brief “<a href="https://www.piie.com/publications/policy-briefs/2024/why-trumps-tariff-proposals-would-harm-working-americans" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Why Trump’s Tariff Proposals Would Harm Working Americans</a>” that</p><blockquote><p>a lower-bound estimate of costs to consumers indicates that the tariffs would reduce after-tax incomes by about 3.5 percent for those in the bottom half of the income distribution; tariffs would cost a typical household in the middle of the income distribution at least $1,700 in increased taxes each year.</p></blockquote><p>In sum, Clausing and Lovely wrote:</p><blockquote><p>Tariffs are a regressive and distortionary source of public finance, and they do not help the groups they are intended to help. They instead introduce new economic inefficiencies and collateral damage, and they make it more difficult to work cooperatively with allies and partners to solve our most vexing international problems.</p></blockquote><p>How would the Trump agenda affect the federal budget deficit?</p><p>In an Aug. 26 report, “<a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/8/26/trump-campaign-policy-proposals-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The 2024 Trump Campaign Policy Proposals</a>: Budgetary, Economic and Distributional Effects,” the <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Penn Wharton Budget Model</a> at the University of Pennsylvania calculated that “Trump campaign tax and spending proposals would increase primary deficits by $4.1 trillion over the next 10 years.” For comparison, the Penn Wharton model <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/8/26/harris-campaign-policy-proposals-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">predicted</a> a $2 trillion increase over 10 years under Kamala Harris’s economic proposals.</p><p>In a recent critique of Trump’s 2018 and ’19 trade war with China, “<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32082" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Help for the Heartland?</a> The Employment and Electoral Effects of the Trump Tariffs in the United States,” four economists, <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/david-h-autor" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Autor</a>, <a href="https://www.nber.org/people/anne_beck?page=1&amp;perPage=50" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anne Beck</a>, <a href="https://ddorn.net/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Dorn</a> and <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/gordon-hanson" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gordon H. Hanson</a>, wrote:</p><blockquote><p>We evaluate whether the tariff war between the United States, China and other U.S. trade partners in 2018-19 succeeded in meeting then-President Trump’s stated goal of bringing back jobs to America and generating support for Trump and the Republican Party. We find consistent evidence on both questions.</p><p>The net effect of import tariffs, retaliatory tariffs and farm subsidies on employment in locations exposed to the trade war was at best a wash, and it may have been mildly negative. U.S. import tariffs had either insignificantly negative or insignificantly positive employment effects, retaliatory tariffs had a consistent and significant negative employment impact, and only a minor part of these adverse effects were offset by agricultural subsidies.</p></blockquote><p>Even though the tariffs were, at best, a wash and the retaliatory tariffs imposed by foreign countries reduced employment, Trump and his fellow Republicans made marked political gains as a result of the trade policies, Autor and his colleagues noted:</p><blockquote><p>The trade war appears to have been successful in strengthening support for the Republican Party. Residents of tariff-protected locations became less likely to identify as Democrats and more likely to vote for President Trump. Although retaliatory tariffs were more effective in reducing employment than import tariffs were in boosting employment, retaliatory tariffs were less effective in reducing Republican electoral support than import tariffs were in boosting Republican electoral support.</p><p>Voters thus appear to have responded favorably to the extension of tariff protections to local industries despite their economic cost. Although the goal of bringing back jobs to the heartland remained elusive, voters in regions that had borne the economic brunt of Chinese import competition in the 1990s and 2000s were particularly likely to reward the Trump government for its tariff policy.</p></blockquote><p>The negative economic consequences of Trump’s tariff proposal pale in comparison with the pain his plan to deport millions of undocumented immigrants would inflict.</p><p>In a March Peterson Institute report, “<a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2024/trumps-proposed-mass-deportations-would-backfire-us-workers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump’s Proposed Mass Deportations Would Backfire on U.S. Workers</a>,” <a href="https://www.piie.com/experts/senior-research-staff/michael-clemens" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michael A. Clemens</a>, a senior fellow and economist at the institute, wrote that Trump</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-r/2024/national/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has embraced</a> an election platform of mass deportation for immigrants who are in the country illegally. He has called for <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-returns-border-closer-pledging-immigration-elected/story?id=107639755" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">military troops</a> to seize <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/us/politics/trump-2025-immigration-agenda.html" title="">millions of people</a> each year in “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/us/politics/trump-2025-immigration-agenda.html" title="">workplace raids and other sweeps in public places</a>” and sending those caught into “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/14/trump-mass-deportation-immigration-stephen-miller/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">giant detention camps</a>.” The “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-returns-border-closer-pledging-immigration-elected/story?id=107639755" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">largest domestic deportation in American history</a>” would begin on Jan. 20, 2025.</p></blockquote><p>“Mass deportation,” Stephen Miller, one of Trump’s top aides on immigration, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/us/politics/trump-2025-immigration-agenda.html" title="">promised</a>, “will be a labor-market disruption celebrated by American workers, who will now be offered higher wages with better benefits to fill these jobs.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Clemens argued:</p><blockquote><p>The immigrants being targeted for removal are the lifeblood of several parts of the U.S. economy. Their deportation will instead prompt U.S. business owners to cut back or start fewer new businesses, in some cases shifting their investments to less labor-intensive technologies and industries while scaling back production to reflect the loss of consumers for their goods.</p></blockquote><p>Clemens cited a separate study, “<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/721152" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Labor Market Effects of Immigration Enforcement</a>” by the economists <a href="https://www.chloeneast.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chloe N. East</a>, <a href="https://anniehines.weebly.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Annie Hines</a>, <a href="https://clas.ucdenver.edu/economics/sites/default/files/attached-files/cv_philip_luck.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Philip Luck</a>, <a href="https://hani-mansour.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hani Mansour</a> and <a href="https://www.andreapvelasquez.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Andrea Velásquez</a>, which digs into a 2008 to ’14 initiative called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Communities" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Secure Communities</a>. The program was conducted during the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama and resulted in the deportation of just under half a million men, women and children.</p><p>“Research has shown that, far from generating economic benefits, their net effect was to reduce<em> </em>employment and earnings for U.S. workers — in the short run and long run,” the authors wrote. “Mass deportation under Secure Communities substantially harmed<em> </em>U.S. workers county by county, reducing both their employment and wages. The worst harms were inflicted on the least educated and most vulnerable U.S. workers.”</p><p>The implications of the East et al. analysis, Clemens wrote,</p><blockquote><p>are staggering. They imply that for every one million unauthorized immigrant workers seized and deported from the United States, 88,000 U.S. native workers were driven out of employment.</p><p>So if the presumptive nominee’s campaign plan for “millions” of deportations per year called for the removal of three million unauthorized immigrant workers per year, that would mean 263,000 fewer<em> </em>jobs held by U.S. native workers, compounded each additional year that mass deportations continue.</p><p>These figures do not reflect temporary layoffs from which U.S. workers could immediately recover by turning around and finding another job. They represent persistent declines in the number of jobs available to be held by any U.S. workers.</p></blockquote><p>Clemens asked “how the disappearance of migrant workers negatively affects the labor market for U.S. workers.”</p><p>The answer, he said,</p><blockquote><p>is that the U.S. labor market is more complex than the cartoon economy in the minds of some politicians, who think that business owners faced with loss of immigrant workers will simply hire native workers to replace them.</p><p>But in the real economy, employers respond in several other ways. Business owners hit by sudden reductions to labor supply invest less in new business formation. They <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjr011" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">invest their capital</a> in other industries and in technologies that use lower-skill labor less intensively, reducing demand for U.S. workers too.</p></blockquote><p>Then, Clemens continued,</p><blockquote><p>in a one-two punch, the disappearance of migrant workers dries up local demand at grocery stores, leasing offices and other nontraded services. The resulting blow to demand for all workers overwhelms the reduction in supply of foreign workers.</p></blockquote><p>For those seeking a stronger American economy and the rule of law, Clemens concluded,</p><blockquote><p>shouts for shock troops, mass purges and deportation camps ring in the air. History teaches us that as a tool for economic policy, those purges will do worse than fail; they will do harm to working families across this country.</p></blockquote><p>What about the combined effect of tariffs and mass deportation?</p><p><a href="https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/profile/brad-delong" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brad DeLong</a>, an economist at Berkeley, contended in an Aug. 22 <a href="https://x.com/delong/status/1826707764821065805" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posting on X</a> that</p><blockquote><p>Trump tariffs and mass deportation, taken together, would be the largest adverse supply shock ever inflicted on the American economy. They would in all likelihood generate a combination of inflation and depression America has never before seen. Our macroeconomic troubles would dwarf anything we saw in the 1970s or at any other time.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://sociology.fas.harvard.edu/people/theda-skocpol" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Theda Skocpol</a>, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard, argued in an email that based on her on-the-ground research in “eight different pro-Trump counties, two apiece in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio from 2017 to 2019” that “what most Americans do not want — or probably even envisage — is what Trump is loudly and specifically promising: immediate, massive interior roundups of undocumented people already here, often for many years.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The mass deportation issue, she wrote, was “the policy realm where I found the most division among conservatives, Republicans and Trump supporters, let alone Democratic-versus-G.O.P. divides.”</p><p>In the pro-Trump communities where Skocpol and her colleagues conducted their research,</p><blockquote><p>families with documented and undocumented members together are vital work force participants (on dairy farms, in construction, in elder care and hospital cleanup jobs, in restaurants). These families have children in schools — with classmates, sports teams and parents who will be very upset if a father or mother is carried away or if the entire family up and leaves in anticipation of raids. These families go to churches where fellow congregants will see deportation raids and roundups as biblical horrors.</p></blockquote><p>Finally — speaking of biblical horrors — we get to a Trump proposal that has no justification and would constitute an enormous danger to the nation’s students: the former president’s threat to cut off federal money to any program that requires schoolchildren to get vaccinated.</p><p>“I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate,” Trump <a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-campaigns-at-faith-freedom-conference" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> at the June 22 Faith and Freedom Conference.</p><p>Skocpol argued in her email that the media need to specify, especially after Robert F. Kennedy’s endorsement of Trump, “what it is going to mean if Trump carries through another loud promise, to cut off funding to schools that keep their vaccine mandates.”</p><p>The consequences?</p><p>“Dead children and contagious classrooms,” Skocpol wrote. “How will that go over?”</p><p>What if Trump gets elected and his policies prove disastrous?</p><p><a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/bfriedman/home" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Benjamin Friedman,</a> an economist at Harvard, emailed me to say:</p><blockquote><p>The further question that arises, thinking about both the tariffs and monetary policy but in other areas as well, is what Trump would do when things go sour — when his policies don’t deliver the results he’s promised for them. The historical pattern is for dictators then to find scapegoats to blame. Think Stalin when the Bolsheviks’ industrial policies and farm collectivization failed or Mao when the Great Leap Forward resulted in widespread starvation. Whom will Trump pick as his scapegoats?</p></blockquote></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Thomas B. Edsall has been a contributor to the Times Opinion section since 2011.
