The lawyer, Joel Leppard, said the women said that Gaetz paid money for their services via Venmo and that they traveled with him numerous times, including to New York, where he took them to see “Pretty Woman” on Broadway.</p><p>“Your future attorney general, everyone,” Desi Lydic said Tuesday on “The Daily Show.” “It’s always the people you most expect.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-1"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2lVHumVPYgk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><blockquote><p>“And they said he paid for sex with Venmo? Has this guy ever heard of cash? Come on. At the bare minimum, an attorney general should know how to cover up his own crimes.” <em>— DESI LYDIC</em></p><p>“The fact that Matt Gaetz was stupid enough to pay for sex with Venmo — that alone should be disqualifying.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“That is crazy. Taking a woman you pay for sex to see ‘Pretty Woman’ is like taking a giraffe to the zoo.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“It’s a little on the nose, wasn’t it? I guess ‘High School Musical’ was sold out?” <em>— DESI LYDIC</em></p><p>“The worst part is that he apparently took them to watch him on Fox News. God, I hope they charged him extra for that.” <em>— DESI LYDIC</em></p><p>“If Trump can’t get his nominees confirmed through the Senate, his team is considering recess appointments. Recess is where Congress temporarily suspends its proceedings — also where Matt Gaetz finds his girlfriends.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-4c5dd29a">The Punchiest Punchlines (King of the Road Edition)</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“Trump also just nominated Fox News contributor Sean Duffy to serve as secretary of transportation. Yep. If you’re Irish Catholic like me, you know at least 20 guys named Sean Duffy.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“Up till now, I have been critical of Trump’s appointees, but I fully support Duffy. First of all, he has real-world experience — in that he was in the cast of MTV’s ‘The Real World: Boston’ in 1997.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“Now, the Debbie Downers out there claim Duffy’s not qualified for this job just because he has little to no experience in the transportation field. Oh, really? Have you forgotten that Mr. Duffy also served a full term on ‘Road Rules: All Stars’?” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“He hired the guy from ‘Road Rules’ to be secretary of transportation, because of course he did — the word ‘road’ is right in there.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“That is one of his least embarrassing picks. Maybe he’ll pick one of the ‘Teen Moms’ to be secretary of labor.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><blockquote><p>“He was in Congress, but we all know that’s not why Trump picked him. It’s because he’s the co-host of the Fox Business’s ‘The Bottom Line.’ Again, everyone with a TV show gets a call. Where’s my job offer?” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“Donald Trump has nominated our own Sean Duffy to be transportation secretary. At this rate, the morning show will soon just be called ‘Fox.’” <em>— GREG GUTFELD</em></p><p>“Sean Duffy sounds like every character in a Ben Affleck movie.” — <em>JIMMY FALLON</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>Keke Palmer, the author of “Master of Me,” and the actor William Zabka joined Jimmy Fallon and Tariq Trotter in a game of Pajama Password on Tuesday’s “Tonight Show.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-1f978490">What We’re Excited About on Wednesday Night</h2><p>Bridget Everett, the creator and star of “Somebody, Somewhere,” will appear on Wednesday’s “Late Night with Seth Meyers.”</p><h2 id="link-12f48db0">Also, Check This Out</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sabrina Carpenter’s “Taste” was the most successful of this year’s triangular tunes.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan McDermid/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>From Sabrina Carpenter’s “Taste” to Loretta Lynn’s “Fist City,” this week’s Amplifier highlights <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/arts/music/amplifier-newsletter-love-triangles-sabrina-carpenter.html" title="">musical tributes to the love triangle</a>.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
