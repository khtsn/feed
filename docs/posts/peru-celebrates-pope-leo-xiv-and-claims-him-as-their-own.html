Elmer Uchofen, a priest in Chiclayo, recalled traveling long hours by car into the highlands with the bishop to reach parishioners. “We would talk in the car while I was driving,” Father Uchofen said.</p><p>“And he would listen quite a bit. He would arrive and he was very, very cordial with the people, especially the people of the Sierra to whom he would offer his help.”</p><p>“He always had a low profile. Very patient, very smiling,” Father Uchofen said. “He also said things firmly when he saw something that was not right or something that was not in accordance with the things of the Church.”</p><p>He said he thought that Pope Leo represented “a continuity” with Pope Francis, who emphasized compassion for the poor, and for migrants, and a need to bring the church to the people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Peruvians in Chiclayo celebrating the election of the new pope.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Marco Garro for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“It is not a radical change,” said Father Uchofen, “but to reinforce many things.”</p><p>In the center of Chiclayo, Juana Loren, 60, a church volunteer and part of a women’s prayer group at the cathedral called Adorers of the Blessed Sacrament, said that the pope — when he was a bishop — had confirmed her daughter.</p><p>She showed off photographs of her and the other women in her group with Leo, as well as a letter that he wrote to them in September to commemorate the group’s 23rd anniversary.</p><p>“He had a lot of holiness.
