Videos filmed by witnesses showed the part flying off the helicopter as it plunged into the river.</p><p>As she cautioned that the investigation was just beginning, Ms. Homendy would not speculate on what had caused the crash. A typical investigation can take a year or two to complete, according to the agency.</p><p>“Everything is on the table — we don’t rule anything out,” she said at a news conference with officials from Jersey City, near the site of the crash, on Friday afternoon. She did not offer a timetable for the investigation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A team of 17 agents was on site to begin the painstaking process of reviewing the condition of the aircraft, a Bell 206L-4 helicopter. The fuselage was pulled from the water on Thursday. But in addition to the main rotor, other parts, including the tail rotor and the main transmission, were missing.</p><p>The aircraft had departed from a heliport in Lower Manhattan at about 2:50 p.m. on Thursday and crashed about 25 minutes later, Ms. Homendy said.</p><p>The crash killed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/world/europe/hudson-river-helicopter-crash-dead-spain-siemens-agustin-escobar.html" title="">Agustín Escobar,</a> the chief executive for rail infrastructure for the technology company Siemens; his wife, Mercè Camprubí Montal; and their three children, all of whom were under 11. The family was on vacation from their home in Spain. The pilot, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/nyregion/seankese-johnson-nyc-helicopter-crash.html" title="">Seankese Johnson</a>, a 36-year-old Navy veteran, also died in the crash.</p><p>Mr. Johnson’s flying record was still being reviewed, according to Ms. Homendy, who said he had accrued 788 total hours of flight time, and had a commercial pilot’s license.</p><p>Ms. Homendy, emphasizing that the investigation was in its very early stages, noted that the air-tour industry had been a concern for a number of years. She cited the <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/ERA18MA099.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">March 2018 crash</a> of a “doors-off” sightseeing helicopter that crashed into the East River after an accidental loss of engine power. Five passengers were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/11/nyregion/new-york-city-helicopter-crash.html" title="">killed in that crash</a>, which led to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/nyregion/doors-off-helicopter-flights-halt.html" title="">a ban on doors-off helicopter</a> flights in New York City.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>She said that she was aware of reports of a large flock of birds near the area of the helicopter shortly before the crash, and that her team was looking into it.</p><p>Ms. Homendy asked members of the public to send in any videos or images they had of the crash, saying that footage circulating on social media was a help to investigators.</p><p>“A lot of those videos are from a very far distance, so we’ll have to look at those a little bit further back at headquarters,” she said. “But we are hoping to get additional videos that provide us information.”</p><p>At least 32 people have died in helicopter accidents in New York City since 1977, according to The Associated Press, and Thursday’s crash was the deadliest in the metro region in seven years.</p><p>Some elected officials in New York are pointing to the crash as the latest evidence that the city’s air space, which is primarily controlled by the federal government, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/nyregion/nyc-helicopter-crash-history.html" title="">needs to be better regulated</a>.</p><p>Two of the three heliports in New York are controlled by the city, which has the authority to alter its license agreements with commercial helicopter operators. Several proposals that would restrict tourist and other nonessential helicopter rides have been introduced in the City Council.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stefanos Chen is a Times reporter covering New York City’s transit system.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
