    <h1>Slaying Dragons for 20 Years</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>You might not have played World of Warcraft, but you probably know of it. The game, which turns 20 this year, inspired an Emmy-winning “South Park” episode and a (not-so-great) movie. Its fans include celebrities like Henry Cavill and Mila Kunis.</p><p>WoW, as the game is known, was social media before social media. As a teenager, I would log on as my undead mage character mostly to hang out with my friends. What we did together was certainly different than how people use today’s social media; I do not typically hunt giant dragons on Facebook or Instagram. But it was a chance to socialize with the people I had met in the game. It was also, as a 16-year-old, the only space I felt safe being openly gay.</p><p>The game was truly huge. When it was released 20 years ago, so many people tried to play that the servers struggled for weeks to handle the demand. At its peak, WoW had more than 12 million monthly subscribers worldwide, making it one of the biggest games of its time. More than 100 million people have played it at one point or another.</p><p>Perhaps most impressively, the game is still going. It got a new expansion, called The War Within, this year. Imagine everything that has changed in the world since 2004, when phones were still dumb and the biggest movie of the year was “Shrek 2.” WoW has endured all of that.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>My colleagues wrote about World of Warcraft’s 20th anniversary in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/arts/world-of-warcraft-20th-anniversary.html" title="">this lovely story that published today</a>. We’ve included excerpts from their reporting below.

In 2009, a Nielsen survey found that it was the most popular core title among female gamers between the ages of 25 and 54.</p><p>Many games structured around player-versus-player conflicts stoke negativity in the form of trash talk. World of Warcraft is not immune to bad behavior, but rather than fighting one another, players generally work together to defeat computer-controlled enemies. Groups of like-minded players form guilds to collaborate on dungeons or role-playing.</p><p>“People opt into that,” said Holly Longdale, the executive producer for World of Warcraft. “You don’t have to partake. That’s what creates these opportunities for safety and comfort.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-62f3989d">A case study in virology</h2><p>In 2005, a harmful effect called Corrupted Blood spread throughout the game’s world, angering players but intriguing epidemiologists. Corrupted Blood, which damaged players for several seconds before infecting others nearby, escalated because of a programming error that mistakenly extended the effect. In theory, players should have died before carrying the infection too widely. But it spread as players used portals to travel to other regions and was further amplified by pets and non-playable characters.</p><p>Years before the real-world Covid pandemic, the World of Warcraft community <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/04/09/world-warcraft-experienced-pandemic-2005-that-experience-may-help-coronavirus-researchers/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attempted self-isolation and quarantines</a>.

Mats Steen, who had a degenerative muscle disease, spent most of his time inside, and his parents believed he had few friends.

Clocking in at a fleet 207 pages in paperback, this gorgeous book follows a day in the life of six astronauts circling Earth on a space station at 17,500 miles per hour. Only, in this weightless world — where humans have no use for legs and forks are secured to tables with magnets — each day consists of 16 sunrises and sunsets, 16 days and 16 nights. The astronauts observe, experiment, eat, mourn, celebrate and wrestle with their own places in the universe, and Harvey takes readers along for the ride. Her plot is as scarce as oxygen in space but, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/05/books/review/orbital-samantha-harvey.html" title="">as our reviewer wrote</a>, “Sometimes, wonder and beauty suffice.”</p><h2 id="link-60b5e8f7">More on books</h2><ul><li><p>What happens when a son doesn’t love his father’s book recommendations?

This summer, my mother, who had A.L.S. and was living in Toronto, died via MAID. In the time since, I realized I had lingering questions about the practice. I was hoping Wiebe could answer them.</em></p><p><strong>In Ontario, one of the steps in the [MAID] process is that you have two independent assessments from a doctor or a nurse practitioner who helps determine whether a patient is eligible. I was at one of those assessments. I’m sitting in a room listening to a conversation between my mom and a doctor who has never met my mom before and is trying to assess her material, physical and psychological situation. Why would this doctor think she can understand the fullness of this situation based on a one-hour call?</strong></p><p>First of all, the clinician who assessed your mother reviewed her medical history, and it was extensive, I’m sure. Secondly, our job during those assessments is to make sure that the person understands their condition. Remember, some of the A.L.S. patients we assess can’t talk. But your mother was still verbal, right?</p><p><strong>Yeah.</strong></p><p>So being able to understand that she understood her condition, that she understood her options — that probably wasn’t very difficult. That is the main thing that we are assessing: Do they <em>understand</em> this decision?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p><strong>MAID applicants have to be of sound mind. My mom was physically suffering but also depressed. Depression, as I understand it, is a mood disorder. How can we say with certainty that someone experiencing a disordered mood or state of mind is making a rational choice?</strong></p><p>When people are clinically depressed, they tend to believe that they are bad people, that it’s their fault that things are going wrong. That is disordered thinking that might respond to therapy. But if a person like your mother says, I’m losing everything, what’s the point in going on just to get worse — that’s pretty logical.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/16/magazine/doctor-ellen-wiebe-maid-interview.html" title=""><em>Read more of the interview here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id="link-640bc3b8"><span><strong>THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Illustration by Armando Veve</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-33"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ryan Liebe for The New York Times.
