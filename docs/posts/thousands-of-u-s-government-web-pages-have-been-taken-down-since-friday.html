missing pages appeared related to a Trump administration directive — with a deadline of 5 p.m. Friday — to terminate any programs that promote “gender ideology,” and to withdraw documents and any other media that may do so.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In many cases, the removed pages mentioned words like “inclusion” or “transgender.” It is not clear why other pages were removed; how many of the pages will be permanently removed; and how many may be restored with revisions.</p><p>And things are still in flux: Since Friday, several pages have gone down and then come back online; others stayed up well past 5 p.m. Friday and were removed only recently. Other government pages, while still accessible, have already been stripped of words related to diversity, gender and climate change, as reported by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/31/federal-agencies-websites-trump/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a> and others.</p><p>In all, these pages represent a tiny sliver of the millions of pages hosted on government domains — roughly one tenth of one percent of all pages.</p><h3 id="link-56f0fd6f"><span><strong>What The Times did</strong></span></h3><p>On Friday, The Times downloaded the list of the <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/data/live/top-100000-domains-30-days.csv" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">most visited government domains</a> in the U.S. and began compiling the complete list of pages available on each one using each site’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_map" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sitemap</a>, a file that outlines the structure of a website and is typically used by search engines to keep track of what’s on the internet. (Some sites, including <a href="https://www.state.gov/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state.gov</a> and <a href="https://www.weather.gov/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">weather.gov</a>, were not included in our analysis because we were unable to identify a complete list of web pages on their sites, or for other technical reasons.) In all, we were able to identify more than seven million pages across more than 150 sites.</p><p>We then repeated this process several times Friday night and on Saturday, and compared our new list of websites with those we originally found.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h3 id="link-741788dd"><span>What remains uncertain</span></h3><p>It’s hard to capture every single change on a system of websites as vast as those that span the federal government. Some things to keep in mind:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Our approach has some trade-offs.</strong> We chose to measure changes on government websites using sitemaps rather than trying to download a complete copy of millions of web pages. This allowed us to measure a much larger scope of changes quickly, but means we may have missed instances where pages weren’t removed but still had substantive edits.</p></li><li><p><strong>This is a snapshot.</strong> In their efforts to take down some pages to comply with the executive order, officials across the government may be taking down wider swaths of sites while changes are being made. As such, some pages may yet return online. The C.D.C., for example, has already had many <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pages</a> return after going offline. And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250130010904/https://www.sandia.gov/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a> for Sandia National Laboratories, a research and development lab under contract with the Department of Energy, was live on Friday and Saturday, but was down early Sunday morning.</p></li><li><p><strong>Our figures may be underestimates.</strong> We looked at only the most visited government domains, and as discussed above, some high-profile sites like <a href="https://www.state.gov/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state.gov</a> were outside our analysis. But the sites we checked do represent the majority of the pages most people actually visit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Our figures may be overestimates.</strong> Some pages we identified as missing may have simply been moved to a new URL that we were not able to identify. (We counted URLs as being removed if we found they had been redirected to substantively different pages, such as the home page of a website.) And it’s possible that the original list of government websites we identified on Friday included pages in their sitemaps that had already been taken down weeks or months before. The subjects and topics of the pages that have been taken down suggest that’s probably not the case, on average, but it’s possible.</p></li><li><p><strong>We don’t have comparable measures of changes in other administrations. </strong>Although government websites <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/us/politics/trump-white-house-website.html" title="">often change</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/20/us/politics/biden-white-house-website.html" title="">between administrations</a>, this weekend’s changes appear to be of a much wider scope than those that have happened in the past. Still, we do not have the same measures from previous administrations. </p></li></ul><p>Figures are as of 9 a.m. Eastern on Sunday.</p><p>Josh Katz<!-- --> and <!-- -->Andrew Fischer<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Feb. 2, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated an agency’s name.
