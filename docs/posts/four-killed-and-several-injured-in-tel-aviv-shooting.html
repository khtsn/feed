Israel’s emergency service agency, Magen David Adom, said it was treating the injured, two of whom were critically wounded and had lost consciousness.</p><p>Images broadcast on Israeli television showed two gunmen in street clothes carrying large rifles.

The streets of the city were quickly emptying.</p><p>Not long after the shooting, the air raid sirens of Israel’s air defense system began to sound across Tel Aviv, sending residents fleeing for shelters. Loud booming explosions were heard over the city a short time after, and flashes of light from Israel’s air defense system could be seen.</p><p>Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liam Stack is a Times reporter on special assignment in Israel, covering the war in Gaza.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack">More about Liam Stack</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Israel Invades Lebanon:</strong><strong> </strong>The Israeli military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-ground-invasion.html">began a ground invasion of southern Lebanon</a>, targeting what it said was Hezbollah military infrastructure in villages close to the Israel-Lebanon border.</p></li><li><p><strong>Striking on Multiple Fronts:</strong><strong> </strong>The escalation of violence between Israel and Iran-backed proxies across the Middle East <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-yemen-gaza.html">threatened to bring the combatants</a> closer to an all-out regional war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iran Projects Caution: </strong>Leaders in Tehran suggested it would be the Lebanese militia that would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/world/middleeast/iran-hezbollah-israel-nasrallah.html">strike back at Israel</a> after the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the longtime leader of Hezbollah, and bombings in Beirut.</p></li><li><p><strong>Biden-Netanyahu Disconnect:</strong><strong> </strong>Israeli officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/us/politics/hezbollah-strike-nasrallah-biden-netanyahu.html">gave their American counterparts no advance warning</a> of the strike that killed Nasrallah.
