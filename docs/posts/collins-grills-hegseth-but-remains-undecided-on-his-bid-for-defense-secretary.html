    <h1>Collins Grills Hegseth but Remains Undecided on His Bid for Defense Secretary</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>She said she also used her time with Mr. Hegseth to press him on policy matters, including defense procurement reforms, the role of women in the military, sexual assault in the military, Ukraine and NATO.</p><p>Ms. Collins characterized the session as a “good, substantive discussion.”</p><p>But it was clear that Mr. Hegseth had not yet won her support. Afterward, he told reporters that he had no idea how Ms. Collins would eventually come down on his nomination.</p><p>“I am not going to assume anything about where the senator stands,” he told reporters, adding: “I hope, in time, when we get through that committee and to the floor, that we can earn her support.”</p><p>Mr. Hegseth, who is likely to need the votes of all but three Republicans to be confirmed, has been working this week to win over potential skeptics like Ms. Collins. On Tuesday, he met with Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who is also considered a potential holdout. Like Ms. Collins, Ms. Murkowski declined to endorse Mr. Hegseth afterward, saying they “had a good exchange, and we’ll see what the process bears.”</p><p>He had better luck with Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, who after initially sounding hostile to his bid and pointedly declining to support him after their first meeting came out on Monday signaling a more positive view.</p></div></div>
