The adaptation is necessary for survival amid relentless Russian assaults on Kharkiv, which is just 25 miles from the border with Russia. </p><p>“This is our new reality,” Veronika Koval, a mezzo-soprano who plays in “The Marriage of Figaro,” said outside the opera house as air-raid sirens blared in the background. “It’s war, but no one is going to stop us from living because of that.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>More than 30 months of fighting have taught Kharkiv how to live amid the constant threat of bombings.</p><p>This resilience is manifested in a curious blend of life above and below ground. On the surface, dance shows continue in public squares, and skateboarders still glide across plazas, defiantly embracing normalcy. Underground, a new way of life has emerged, imposed by the Russian attacks, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/20/world/europe/kharkiv-ukraine-russia-radio-station.html" title="">schools set up in subway stations</a> and rock concerts held in basement bars.</p><p>Utopia Bar, a cocktail bar, opened its doors in a basement about six months ago. Ihor Huzhva, the founder, said he had specifically chosen an underground location to help ensure that “our customers feel safe,” adding, with a touch of pride, that the basement was originally a bomb shelter during World War II.</p><p>The name Utopia, he noted, refers to the “ideal civilization” that the bar offers, relatively free from the dangers lurking above ground.</p><p>“I feel super safe here. I come here knowing that nothing will happen to me,” Mr. Huzhva said as he served cocktails in front of rows of liquor bottles lit by a thin orange light. “When I step outside, it’s a different story. There can be explosions and constant alarms.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An underground rock concert at a bar.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A military recruitment billboard displaying the image of a fallen soldier and the quote “To be a soldier is to live forever.” Nearby, nightlife continues.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kharkiv’s National Academic Opera and Ballet Theater now operates underground in a garage where trucks once delivered costumes and scenery.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>To be sure, many Kharkiv residents still cherish their life above ground.</p><p>On a recent evening, small groups of revelers made their way to Che, a fancy bar in the city center, its neon signs flashing in the darkness that had descended on the area because of power outages.</p><p>Arsen Kulikov, 28, who was sipping a mocktail, said that Che was one of the last venues in Kharkiv where people could party late at night. “Even if there’s an opportunity to hold events underground,” he said, “most people still prefer to be above ground.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Kulikov and his friends said people often ignored air-raid alerts now, choosing to stay outside rather than rushing to bomb shelters. The alerts have become too frequent to be carefully heeded, they explained, recalling one in July that <a href="https://global.espreso.tv/russia-ukraine-war-longest-air-raid-alert-ends-in-kharkiv-ukraine" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lasted more than two days</a> without interruption. “People can’t live like that,” Mr. Kulikov said.</p><p>That is also the approach taken by <a href="https://finaribba.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Finaribba</a>, a private school in Kharkiv that holds classes above ground, unlike most schools. In June, it organized a graduation event outdoors, despite the risks, with the children spending the day playing with balloons. Other schools also held outdoor graduation ceremonies; at one girls in blue dresses and boys in white shirts danced in a public square.</p><p>“Children need to see open spaces, light, and nature,” said Marina Bessonova, the head of Finaribba. “Life is uncertain, and danger can arise at any moment, whether you’re walking with your child, driving to school or going to the supermarket. Therefore, keeping a child underground all day in a school doesn’t make sense and is not beneficial for their overall well-being.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Some schools held outdoor graduation ceremonies despite the bombardments, with graduates dancing in public squares.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A recital for family and friends at a music school.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A private school that has still been holding  classes above ground.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>After a summer lull, which residents greeted with relief, Russian attacks on Kharkiv have resumed in recent weeks, with devastating effect.</p><p>The city’s Palace of Sports, home to a 4,000-seat arena, was destroyed, according to Ukraine’s National Olympic Committee. A shopping center, along with various stores and cars, was also damaged, Ukrainian officials said.</p><p>A battery commander with Ukraine’s 42nd Separate Mechanized Brigade, which has been deployed to the Kharkiv region to repel Russian ground assaults there, said Moscow was using a wide range of weapons to strike. The commander, who asked to be identified only by his call sign, Bureviy, according to military protocol, said that included powerful guided bombs loaded with hundreds of pounds of explosives, Lancet drones, often referred to as “kamikaze” drones, and 152-millimeter howitzer guns.</p><p>In Lyptsi, a village some 15 miles north of Kharkiv that Russian troops have tried to seize, Bureviy said his unit had been struck by four Lancet drones in just two days.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Emergency services at the scene of a strike in Kharkiv in June.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A soldier who goes by the call sign Bureviy.
