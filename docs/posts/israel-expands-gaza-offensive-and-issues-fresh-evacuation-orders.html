On Sunday, it said that those operations had moved into additional areas in the north and south of the enclave.</p><p>Israel said that its troops had begun operating in Beit Hanoun, in northern Gaza, to expand a buffer zone. The military also said that it had carried out more airstrikes against Hamas targets and infrastructure and that it was allowing people to evacuate.</p><p>The military also separately issued an evacuation order for the Tal al-Sultan neighborhood of the southern city of Rafah, telling residents to leave on foot along a specific route and barring the movement of vehicles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The Rafah municipality said in a statement that thousands of families were being forced to flee on foot under bombardment <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/card/2025/03/23/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-ramadan?searchResultPosition=3" title="">during the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan</a>.

The ministry’s figures do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p><p>Hamas announced that Israel had killed a senior member of its political bureau, Salah al-Bardawil, overnight. The group said that Mr. al-Bardawil, one of the militant group’s prominent spokesmen, had been killed along with his wife in a strike on their tent in Al-Mawasi, an area in southern Gaza that the Israeli military had designated as a humanitarian zone and to which it directed residents of Tal al-Sultan on Sunday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After noon on Sunday, the military said that its troops had completely encircled Tal al-Sultan, had eliminated several fighters and had raided a site that it said had been used over the past few months as a Hamas command and control center.</p><p>Neither claim could be independently verified.</p><p>The Palestinian Civil Defense in Gaza warned on Sunday of “imminent danger threatening the lives” of more than 50,000 people in Rafah.</p><p>“The situation in Rafah is very difficult,” said Huthayfah Lafi, a resident of the southern city who lives near Tal al-Sultan.

Around dawn on Sunday “they were surprised by Israeli tanks advancing toward them,” he said, relaying what his sister had told him over the phone while fleeing on foot to the city of Khan Younis, where he has been sheltering.</p><p>“They were only allowed to carry a small bag,” said Mr. Abu Taha. </p><p>The Israeli government has said that the renewed offensive — along with blocking the entry of all goods and humanitarian aid into Gaza — is aimed at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-hostages.html?searchResultPosition=11" title="">increasing pressure on Hamas to release hostages</a> still held in the enclave and at destroying the group’s military and governing capabilities. </p><p>The hostages were taken to Gaza during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which ignited the war. Hamas has so far refused to release significant numbers of hostages unless Israel promises to end the war permanently. Israel has conditioned ending the war on Hamas’s agreeing to give up its arms and power in Gaza.</p><p>The resumption of the military campaign in Gaza has not found the same national consensus among Israelis as the war did in the immediate aftermath of the October 2023 assault. Instead, it has increased concerns about the fates of the hostages, up to 24 of whom are believed to still be alive, and it has left many Israelis questioning what could be achieved militarily that was not achieved in the first 15 months of fighting.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Myra Noveck<!-- --> <!-- -->Abu Bakr Bashir<!-- -->, <!-- -->Bilal Shbair<!-- --> and <!-- -->Iyad Abuheweila<!-- -->.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabel Kershner, a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, has been reporting on Israeli and Palestinian affairs since 1990.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabel-kershner">More about Isabel Kershner</a></span></p></div><div><p>Hiba Yazbek covers the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with a focus on Palestinian affairs and society in the Gaza Strip, the occupied West Bank and Israel.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hiba-yazbek">More about Hiba Yazbek</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
