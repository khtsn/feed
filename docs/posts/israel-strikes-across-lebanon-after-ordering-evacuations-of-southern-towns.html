data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Israel pressed on with its bombardment of Lebanon on Friday after issuing widespread evacuation warnings in the country’s south, as the conflict with Hezbollah militants showed no sign of abating despite a U.S.-led push for a cease-fire.</p><p>Some of the Israeli strikes, which came as Lebanon celebrated its independence day, hit near the southern port city of Tyre, following calls by the Israeli military for civilians to evacuate entire towns in the area and flee more than 20 miles north.</p><p>Bombings also targeted the Dahiya, the area near Beirut that is in effect controlled by Hezbollah and has been hit hard in recent days.</p><p>Lebanon’s health ministry said two separate Israeli strikes on Friday had killed five paramedics in southern Lebanon. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Lebanon’s health system has sustained 126 attacks this year that have killed 223 health workers and injured 183 others, Abdinasir Abubakar, the U.N. World Health Organization’s representative in Lebanon, told reporters on Friday. The majority of these casualties have occurred in attacks on ambulances, he said.</p><p>Analysts say Israel’s ramped-up strikes across Lebanon are designed to pressure Hezbollah into agreeing to a cease-fire on terms that are favorable to Israel. Amos Hochstein, the Biden administration’s point man in the quest to end the war, discussed the terms of a possible deal with Israeli officials on Thursday during a visit to Israel.</p><p>U.S. and Israeli officials have provided few details in public about the terms of a deal. An Israeli official said on Friday that there was “cautious optimism” in Israel about the prospect of finalizing the terms in the coming days. A Lebanese official briefed on the talks said that the ball was in Israel’s court, and that Lebanon’s government remained “realistic” that a cease-fire could still fail to materialize. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.</p><p>Mr. Hochstein earlier this week held two days of discussions with Lebanese officials in Beirut, which he said had made progress. Hezbollah’s leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/world/middleeast/hezbollah-new-leader-naim-qassem.html" title="">Naim</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/world/middleeast/hezbollah-new-leader-naim-qassem.html" title="">Qassem</a>, said that Hezbollah had responded to the U.S. proposal and that a truce depended on the “seriousness” of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.</p><p>But Israel and Hezbollah have both pledged to keep fighting during the negotiations, and the violence appears only to have intensified.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Bachir Khodr, the head of the Baalbek-Hermel governorate in eastern Lebanon, said Israeli strikes had killed nearly 50 people in his province on Thursday. The attacks struck more than a dozen towns and villages, he said on social media, describing it as some of the most violent bombardment of the war.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Damaged following an Israeli strike in the neighborhood of Shayyah in Beirut’s southern suburbs on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ibrahim Amro/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At least 10 of those killed were from the village of Flaoui, Lebanon’s health ministry said. The state-run news agency reported that children were among the dead in that village.</p><p>Hussein Awada, a driver who fled his home in the Dahiya weeks ago, said he had returned to the area on Friday to collect some money from a friend. “I spent all I have,” he said.</p><p>Unable to afford cellphone data, he was unaware that Israel had issued an evacuation warning for the neighborhood, and he escaped just minutes before a building was leveled in an Israeli strike, he said. The human rights group Amnesty International has criticized the evacuation warnings as inadequate, in part because they are issued only on social media.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I passed by it almost every day,” he said of the building that was hit. “It’s a business center, as far as I know. Doctors. Lawyers. Travel agencies.”</p><p>Israel began an intensified <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-lebanon-invasion-map.html" title="">military campaign</a> against Hezbollah in September, nearly a year after the group began firing rockets into Israel in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza, which like Hezbollah is backed by Iran. The conflict has killed more than 3,500 people in Lebanon and displaced almost a quarter of the population. It is now the bloodiest conflict inside Lebanon since the country’s 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990.</p><p>Here are other developments:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Gaza hospital:</strong> The Israeli military struck Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza overnight, injuring six medical workers, destroying the hospital’s main generator and damaging water tanks, the Gaza Health Ministry said. The hospital, one of the last that is still functioning in the north of the territory, has been struck repeatedly during a weekslong Israeli offensive there, according to the health ministry and doctors who work there. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Aid workers killed:</strong> The United Nations said that at least 281 aid workers have been killed worldwide in 2024, more than recorded in any other year. It said the war in Gaza was driving the numbers higher and had cost the lives of at least 10 aid workers so far this month. </p></li></ul><p>Adam Rasgon<!-- --> in Jerusalem and <!-- -->Nick Cumming-Bruce<!-- --> in Geneva contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Euan Ward is a reporter contributing to The Times from Beirut.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/euan-ward">More about Euan Ward</a></span></p></div><div><p>Liam Stack is a Times reporter on special assignment in Israel, covering the war in Gaza.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack">More about Liam Stack</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">The Israel Hamas War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hezbollah">Hezbollah</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Censuring Iran for Nuclear Secrecy:</strong> Before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/world/europe/iran-nuclear-iaea-censure.html">the West wants to call out Iran for failing to adhere to treaty obligations</a> to be transparent about its nuclear past and present.</p></li><li><p><strong>Weapons Transfers to Israel:</strong> The Senate resoundingly rejected a series of resolutions to block weapons transfers to Israel, but the move <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/politics/senate-israel-weapons.html">drew substantial support from Democrats</a>, reflecting growing consternation in the party over the conflict.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hostages in Gaza:</strong> As he resists pressure to reach a cease-fire that would release the captives, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is now offering a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/world/middleeast/israel-5-million-dollars-hostage.html">$5 million reward for their freedom</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lebanon’s Unlikely National Hero:</strong> Middle East Airlines has managed to fly through regional and civil wars since the 1960s. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/world/middleeast/middle-east-airlines-lebanon.html">And it is still in the skies today</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Aid Trucks Looted in Gaza:</strong> A large convoy of trucks carrying aid was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-convoy-looted-unrwa-israel.html">“violently looted” in the enclave</a>, the main United Nations agency that helps Palestinians said, calling it one of the worst such incidents of the war.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
