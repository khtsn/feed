    <h1>Israel Strikes Across Lebanon After Ordering Evacuations of Southern Towns</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Analysts say Israel’s ramped-up strikes across Lebanon are designed to pressure Hezbollah into agreeing to a cease-fire on terms that are favorable to Israel. Amos Hochstein, the Biden administration’s point man in the quest to end the war, discussed the terms of a possible deal with Israeli officials on Thursday during a visit to Israel.</p><p>U.S. and Israeli officials have provided few details in public about the terms of a deal. But an Israeli official said on Friday that there was “cautious optimism” in Israel about the prospect of finalizing the terms in the coming days. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.</p><p>Mr. Hochstein earlier this week held two days of discussions with Lebanese officials in Beirut, which he said had made progress. Hezbollah’s leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/world/middleeast/hezbollah-new-leader-naim-qassem.html" title="">Naim</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/world/middleeast/hezbollah-new-leader-naim-qassem.html" title="">Qassem</a>, said that Hezbollah had responded to the U.S. proposal and that a truce depended on the “seriousness” of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.</p><p>But Israel and Hezbollah have both pledged to keep fighting during the negotiations, and the violence appears only to have intensified.</p><p>Bachir Khodr, the head of the Baalbek-Hermel governorate in eastern Lebanon, said Israeli strikes had killed nearly 50 people in his province on Thursday. The attacks struck more than a dozen towns and villages, he said on social media, describing it as some of the most violent bombardment of the war.</p></div></div>
