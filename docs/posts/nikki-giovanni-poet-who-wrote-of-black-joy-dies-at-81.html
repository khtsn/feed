    <h1>Nikki Giovanni, Poet Who Wrote of Black Joy, Dies at 81</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Nikki Giovanni, the charismatic and iconoclastic poet, activist, children’s book author and professor who wrote, irresistibly and sensuously, about race, politics, gender, sex and love, died on Monday in Blacksburg, Va. She was 81.</p><p>Her death, in a hospital, was caused by complications of lung cancer, said Virginia C. Fowler, her wife.</p><p>Ms. Giovanni was a prolific star of the Black Arts Movement, the wave of Black nationalism that erupted during the civil rights era and that was propelled as well by the novelist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/30/obituaries/john-oliver-killens-71-author-and-founder-of-writers-group.html" title="">John Oliver Killens</a>, the playwright and poet LeRoi Jones (later known as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/arts/amiri-baraka-polarizing-poet-and-playwright-dies-at-79.html" title="">Amiri Baraka</a>) and the poets Audre Lorde, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/obituaries/ntozake-shange-is-dead-at-70.html" title="">Ntozake Shange</a> and Sonia Sanchez, among others. Like many women in the movement, Ms. Giovanni was confounded by the machismo that dominated it.</p><p>Yet she was also independent of the movement as a celebrity poet and public intellectual who appeared on television and toured the country. She was a riveting performer, diminutive at 105 pounds — as reporters never failed to point out — her cadence inflected by the jazz and blues music she loved, her timing that of a comedian or a Baptist preacher. She drew crowds wherever she appeared. She said her best audiences were college students and prison inmates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In 1972, when she was 29, Ms. Giovanni sold out the 1,000-plus seats at Lincoln Center’s Alice Tully Hall, reading her poems alongside gospel music performed by the New York Community Choir.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/09/obituaries/09giovanni/09giovanni-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/09/obituaries/09giovanni/09giovanni-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/09/obituaries/09giovanni/09giovanni-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A black-and-white photo from the same session as above, depicting Ms. Giovanni. both arms outstretched, standing next to another young woman." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/09/obituaries/09giovanni/09giovanni-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/09/obituaries/09giovanni/09giovanni-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/09/obituaries/09giovanni/09giovanni-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/09/obituaries/09giovanni/09giovanni-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/34d12469-43b0-5f25-a33b-c868d2a1baf4" decoding="async" width="600" height="435"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Giovanni with Melba Moore at Philharmonic Hall in 1973.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Meyer Liebowitz/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Soon after, for her 30th birthday, she sold out Philharmonic Hall (now David Geffen Hall), all 3,000 seats, where she was joined by Melba Moore and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/20/arts/music/wilson-pickett-64-soul-singer-of-great-passion-dies.html" title="">Wilson Pickett</a>, who sang gospel numbers with the same choir that took part in her earlier show. The audience joined in, too, with gusto, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/22/archives/for-nikki-giovanni-her-poetry-is-her-way-of-life.html" title="">The New York Times reported</a>, especially when she read one of her best-known poems,<span>  </span>a stirring paean to Black female agency called “Ego-Tripping,” which generations of Black girls have performed at school. It begins:</p><p><em>I was born in the congo</em></p><p>And it concludes, triumphantly:</p><p><em>I am so perfect so divine so ethereal so surreal</em></p><p>By 1971, Ms. Giovanni had already published a memoir, “Gemini: An Extended Autobiographical Statement on My First Twenty-Five Years of Being a Black Poet.” Fiercely intelligent, she never lacked confidence, never suffered fools and was, in her youth, a fan of Ayn Rand. In her memoir she wrote about the contradictions and false pieties of the Black Power movement, her scrappiness as a child and her ambivalence about gender relations. She was not convinced that men and women were meant to live together.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Maybe they have a different thing going,” she wrote, “where they come together during mating season and produce beautiful, useless animals who then go on to love, you hope, each of you.”</p><p>Her poem “Housecleaning” made the point succinctly:</p><p><em>i always liked housecleaning</em></p><p>In her early years, much of her poetry was boldly militant, as she addressed the horrors that had galvanized the civil rights movement: the murders of Emmett Till, the four Black girls in the Birmingham church bombing and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. “No one was much interested in a Black girl writing what was called ‘militant’ poetry,” she wrote in “Gemini,” so “I formed a company and published myself.”</p><p>To mollify the church ladies she had grown up with — particularly her beloved grandmother, who might be put off by her incendiary work — she recorded an album, “Truth is on its Way” (1971), with the New York Community Choir.</p><p>“I wanted something my grandmother could listen to,” Ms Giovanni <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=XmAug0CHpV8C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=%22sitting+in+her+comfortable,+casually+furnished%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZVV5xWDwRQ&amp;sig=ACfU3U05e8JHF3u0HkDWPpqbWK0I6XBZwA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjR25D5ma3tAhWlRDABHTOSAjUQ6AEwAHoECAEQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sitting%20in%20her%20comfortable%2C%20casually%20furnished%22&amp;f=false" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Ebony magazine in 1972</a>, “and I knew if gospel music was included, she would listen.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Along with “Ego Tripping,” the album included another enduring hit, “Nikki-Rosa,” which ended with:</p><p><em>and I really hope no white person ever has cause</em></p><p>Yolande Cornelia Giovanni Jr. was born on June 7, 1943, in Knoxville, Tenn., to Yolande (Watson) Giovanni and Jones Giovanni, known as Gus. Her older sister, Gary Ann, nicknamed her Nikki. Soon after her birth, the family moved to Cincinnati, where Yolande and Gus began working as house parents in a school for Black boys, earning only one salary between them. Later, they would each teach grade school.</p><p>Nikki’s father was abusive toward her mother. It enraged her, as did her mother’s acceptance of it.</p><p>By 15, “I was either going to kill him or leave,” she said later, so she moved to Knoxville to live with her grandparents. She graduated early from Austin High School (now Austin-East Magnet High School), where her grandfather taught Latin, to attend Fisk University, the historically Black college in Nashville, where, after a hiatus of a few years, she earned a bachelor’s degree in history with honors in 1967.</p><p>She had been thrown out for leaving campus without permission, and for protesting other campus rules. Becoming a debutante was not among her aspirations (she later wrote a poem about it), which made her an odd fit among Fisk’s sorority sisters.</p><p>But when she returned to resume classes, the climate had changed; she studied with Mr. Killens, a founder of the Harlem Writers Guild; helped restart a chapter of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee; and began to write.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Giovanni attended the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Social Work on a Ford fellowship, but dropped out. She was not cut out for social work. The dean arranged for Ms. Giovanni to receive a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship to attend Columbia University’s School of Fine Arts, but she soon left to write full time.</p><p>She self-published her first two books, “Black Feeling Black Talk” and “Black Judgment” (1968). Her son, Thomas, was born in 1969: “I had a baby at 25 because I <em>wanted</em> to have a baby and I could <em>afford</em> to have a baby,” she told Ebony magazine with vehemence. “I didn’t get married because I didn’t <em>want</em> to get married and I could <em>afford</em> to not get married.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Giovanni with her 2-year-old son, Thomas, in their New York apartment in 1972. “I had a baby at 25,” she said, “because I <em>wanted</em> to have a baby and I could <em>afford</em> to have a baby.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">John Rooney/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But she did need to hustle. She hit the lecture circuit, and she began appearing regularly on “Soul!,” the Black culture program that aired on public television from 1967 to 1972.</p><p>For one segment, she conducted a captivating two-hour interview with her hero James Baldwin, which was filmed in London and ran as a two-part special in 1971. She was 28 and Mr. Baldwin was 47. It was astonishing, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/when-public-television-had-a-little-soul" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as The New Yorker put it</a>: “Two of the most important artist-intellectuals of the twentieth century were engaged in intimate communion on national television.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Wreathed in plumes of cigarette smoke (it was the 1970s), she asked Mr. Baldwin about her father, who was, in her estimation, emblematic of so many Black men: What to do about a man who is mistreated in the world and comes home and brutalizes his wife? Where did that leave his daughter?</p><p>“I’m afraid of Black men,” she said, adding, “It’s a cycle and it’s unfortunate because I need love.”</p><p>Later in their conversation, she said, “There has to be a way to do what we do and survive, which is what seems to me to be missing.”</p><p>“Sweetheart,” Mr. Baldwin answered. “Sweetheart. Our ancestors taught us how to do that.”</p><p>Ms. Giovanni held teaching positions at Rutgers University and Queens College before being recruited in 1987 by Ms. Fowler, who was then the associate head of the English department at Virginia Tech, to be a visiting professor. She earned tenure a few years later. She and Ms. Fowler were a couple ever since, and along the way Ms. Fowler became a scholar of Ms. Giovanni’s work, editing her collections and writing her biography, “Nikki Giovanni” (2013). They married in 2016, and both retired in 2022.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Giovanni appeared regularly on “Soul!,” the Black culture program that aired on public television from 1967 to 1972.

She was the first warrior in terms of talking about queer love — not specifically, but it was there.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Giovanni taught at Virginia Tech for many years.
