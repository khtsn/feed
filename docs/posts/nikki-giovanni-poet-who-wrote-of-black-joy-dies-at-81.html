She was 81.</p><p>The death, in a hospital, was caused by complications of lung cancer, said Virginia C. Fowler, her wife.</p><p>Ms. Giovanni was a prolific star of the Black Arts Movement, the wave of Black nationalism that erupted during the civil rights era and included the novelist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/30/obituaries/john-oliver-killens-71-author-and-founder-of-writers-group.html" title="">John Oliver Killens</a>, the playwright and poet LeRoi Jones, later known as the fiery radical <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/arts/amiri-baraka-polarizing-poet-and-playwright-dies-at-79.html" title="">Amiri Baraka</a>, and the poets Audre Lorde, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/obituaries/ntozake-shange-is-dead-at-70.html" title="">Ntozake Shange</a> and Sonia Sanchez, among others. Like many women in the movement, Ms. Giovanni was confounded by the machismo that dominated it.</p><p>Yet Ms. Giovanni was also a star independent of the movement, a celebrity poet and public intellectual who appeared on television and toured the country. She was a riveting performer, diminutive at just 105 pounds — as reporters never failed to point out — her cadence inflected by the jazz and blues music she loved, with the timing of a comedian or a Baptist preacher who drew crowds wherever she appeared throughout her life. She said her best audiences were college students and prison inmates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p><em>A full obituary will follow.</em></p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
