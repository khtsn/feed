She was 81.</p><p>Her death, in a hospital, was caused by complications of lung cancer, said Virginia C. Fowler, her wife.</p><p>Ms. Giovanni was a prolific star of the Black Arts Movement, the wave of Black nationalism that erupted during the civil rights era and included the novelist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/30/obituaries/john-oliver-killens-71-author-and-founder-of-writers-group.html" title="">John Oliver Killens</a>, the playwright and poet LeRoi Jones, later known as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/arts/amiri-baraka-polarizing-poet-and-playwright-dies-at-79.html" title="">Amiri Baraka</a>, and the poets Audre Lorde, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/obituaries/ntozake-shange-is-dead-at-70.html" title="">Ntozake Shange</a> and Sonia Sanchez, among others. Like many women in the movement, Ms. Giovanni was confounded by the machismo that dominated it.</p><p>Yet Ms. Giovanni was also a star independent of the movement, a celebrity poet and public intellectual who appeared on television and toured the country. She was a riveting performer, diminutive at just 105 pounds — as reporters never failed to point out — her cadence inflected by the jazz and blues music she loved, with the timing of a comedian or a Baptist preacher who drew crowds wherever she appeared throughout her life. She said her best audiences were college students and prison inmates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In 1972, when she was 29, she sold out the 1,000-plus seats at Lincoln Center’s Alice Tully Hall, reading her poems alongside gospel music performed by the New York Community Choir. Soon after, for her 30th birthday, she sold out the Philharmonic theater, all 3,000 seats, where she was joined by Melba Moore and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/20/arts/music/wilson-pickett-64-soul-singer-of-great-passion-dies.html" title="">Wilson Pickett</a>, who sang gospel numbers with the same choir that attended her earlier show. The audience joined in, too, with gusto, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/22/archives/for-nikki-giovanni-her-poetry-is-her-way-of-life.html" title="">The New York Times reported</a>, especially when she read one of her hits, the stirring paeon to Black female agency called “Ego-Tripping,” which generations of Black girls have performed at school. It begins:</p><p><em>I was born in the congo</em></p><p><em>I walked to the fertile crescent and built</em></p><p><em>the sphinx</em></p><p><em>I designed a pyramid so tough that a star</em></p><p><em>that only glows every one hundred years falls</em></p><p><em>into the center giving divine perfect light</em></p><p><em>I am bad</em></p><p>And it concludes, triumphantly:</p><p><em>I am so perfect so divine so ethereal so surreal/I cannot be comprehended/except by my permission/I mean … I … can fly/Like a bird in the sky …</em></p><p>By 1971, she had already published a memoir, “Gemini: An Extended Autobiographical Statement on My First Twenty-Five Years of Being a Black Poet.” Fiercely intelligent, Ms. Giovanni never lacked confidence, never suffered fools and was, in her youth, an Ayn Rand fan. In her book, she wrote about the contradictions and false pieties of the Black power movement, her scrappiness as a child and her ambivalence about gender relations. She was not convinced that men and women were meant to live together.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Poet Nikki Giovanni, left, Kay Mazzo, ballet dancer with the New York City Ballet, and fashion designer Betsey Johnson receive the first Sun Shower Award in 1971.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“Maybe they have a different thing going,” she wrote, “where they come together during mating season and produce beautiful, useless animals who then go on to love, you hope, each of you.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Her poem, “Housecleaning,” made the point succinctly:</p><p><em>i always liked housecleaning</em></p><p><em>even as a child</em></p><p><em>i dug straightening</em></p><p><em>the cabinets</em></p><p><em>putting new paper on</em></p><p><em>the shelves</em></p><p><em>washing the refrigerator</em></p><p><em>inside out</em></p><p><em>and unfortunately this habit has</em></p><p><em>carried over and I find</em></p><p><em>i must remove you</em></p><p><em>from my life</em></p><p>In her early years, much of her poetry was boldly militant, as she addressed the horrors that galvanized the civil rights movement: the murder of Emmett Till, of the four Black girls in the Birmingham church bombing and of Martin Luther King Jr. “No one was much interested in a Black girl writing what was called ‘militant’ poetry,” she wrote in “Gemini,” so “I formed a company and published myself.”</p><p>To mollify the church ladies she had grown up with, particularly her beloved grandmother, who might be put off by her incendiary work, she recorded an album, “Truth is on its Way” (1971), with the New York Community Choir.</p><p>“I wanted something my grandmother could listen to,” <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=XmAug0CHpV8C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=%22sitting+in+her+comfortable,+casually+furnished%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZVV5xWDwRQ&amp;sig=ACfU3U05e8JHF3u0HkDWPpqbWK0I6XBZwA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjR25D5ma3tAhWlRDABHTOSAjUQ6AEwAHoECAEQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sitting%20in%20her%20comfortable%2C%20casually%20furnished%22&amp;f=false" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she told Ebony magazine in 1972</a>, “and I knew if gospel music was included, she would listen.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Along with “Ego Tripping,” the album included another enduring hit, “Nikki-Rosa,” which ended with:</p><p><em>and I really hope no white person ever has cause</em></p><p><em>to write about me</em></p><p><em>because they never understand</em></p><p><em>Black love is Black wealth and they’ll</em></p><p><em>probably talk about my hard childhood</em></p><p><em>and never understand that</em></p><p><em>all the while I was quite happy</em></p><p>Yolande Cornelia Giovanni Jr. was born on June 7, 1943, in Knoxville, Tenn., to Yolande (Watson) Giovanni and Jones Giovanni, known as Gus. Her older sister, Gary Ann, nicknamed her Nikki, and the name stuck. Soon after her birth, the family moved to Cincinnati, where Yolande and Gus began working as house parents in a school for Black boys, earning only one salary between them. Later, they would each teach grade school.</p><p>Nikki’s father was abusive toward her mother. It enraged her, as did her mother’s acceptance of it.</p><p>By 15, “I was either going to kill him, or leave,” she said later, so she moved to Knoxville to live with her grandparents. She graduated early from Austin High School (now Austin-East Magnet High School), where her grandfather taught Latin, to attend Fisk University, the historically Black college in Nashville, where, after a hiatus of a few years, she earned a bachelor’s degree in history, with honors, in 1967.</p><p>She had been thrown out for leaving campus without permission, and for protesting other campus rules. Becoming a debutante was not among her aspirations (she later wrote a poem about it) which made her an odd fit among Fisk’s sorority sisters.</p><p>But when she returned after a few years, the climate had changed; she studied with Mr. Killens, a founder of the Harlem Writers Guild; helped restart a chapter of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee; and began to write.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>She attended the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Social Work on a Ford Fellowship, but dropped out. She was not cut out for social work. The dean arranged for Ms. Giovanni to receive a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship to attend Columbia University’s School of Fine Arts, but she soon left to write full time.</p><p>She self-published her first two books, “Black Feeling Black Talk” and “Black Judgment” (1968). Her son, Thomas, was born in 1969: “I had a baby at 25 because I <em>wanted</em> to have a baby and I could <em>afford</em> to have a baby,” she told Ebony magazine with vehemence. “I didn’t get married because I didn’t <em>want</em> to get married and I could <em>afford</em> to not get married.”</p><p>But she did need to hustle. She hit the lecture circuit, and began appearing regularly on “Soul!,” the influential Black culture program that aired on public television from 1967 to 1972.</p><p>For one segment, she conducted a captivating two-hour interview with her hero, James Baldwin, which was filmed in London and ran as a two-part special in 1971. She was 28 and Mr. Baldwin, 47. It was astonishing, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/when-public-television-had-a-little-soul" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as The New Yorker put it</a>: “Two of the most important artist-intellectuals of the twentieth century were engaged in intimate communion on national television.”</p><p>Wreathed in plumes of cigarette smoke (it was the 70s), she asked Mr. Baldwin about her father, who was, in her estimation, emblematic of so many Black men: What to do about a man who is mistreated in the world and comes home and brutalizes his wife? Where did that leave his daughter?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I’m afraid of Black men,” she said, adding, “It’s a cycle and it’s unfortunate because I need love.”</p><p>Later in their conversation, she said, “There has to be a way to do what we do and survive, which is what seems to me to be missing.”</p><p>“Sweetheart,” Mr. Baldwin answered. “Sweetheart. Our ancestors taught us how to do that.”</p><p>Ms. Giovanni held teaching positions at Rutgers and Queens College before being recruited in 1987 by Ms. Fowler, who was then the associate head of the English department at Virginia Tech, to be a visiting professor. She earned tenure a few years later. She and Ms. Fowler have been a couple ever since, and along the way Ms. Fowler became a scholar of her work, editing her collections and writing her biography, “Nikki Giovanni” (2013). They married in 2016, and retired in 2022.</p><p>Ms. Giovanni called Ms. Fowler her bench, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/16/books/nikki-giovanni-make-me-rain.html" title="">as she explained to Elizabeth Harris of The New York Times in 2020</a>.</p><p>“Everybody needs a bench, and in order to get a bench, you have to be one,” Ms. Giovanni said. “I could say love, but you get tired of hearing about love.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>That said, she wrote many enticing love poems, including one that read:</p><p><em>I wrote a good omelet … and ate a hot poem …</em></p><p><em>after loving you</em></p><p>Hilton Als, the cultural critic and New Yorker writer, said in a phone interview that when he first heard Ms. Giovanni perform in the early ’70s, he was struck by her presence and the story she was telling, about a strong Black woman and the home that sustained her, epitomized in her poem, “My House.”</p><p><em>i mean it’s my house</em></p><p><em>and i want to fry pork chops</em></p><p><em>and bake sweet potatoes</em></p><p><em>and call them yams</em></p><p><em>cause i run the kitchen</em></p><p><em>and i can stand the heat</em></p><p>“It was a voice you didn’t hear a lot then, this desire for home,” he said. “Later, as she ditched the Black nationalist rhetoric, she became more herself. She was saying something really profound to me, a member of the gay community and the Black world and whatever. She was the first warrior in terms of talking about queer love, not specifically, but it was there.”</p><p>Among many honors, she received seven N.A.A.C.P. awards and 31 honorary doctorates. And a scientist who was a fan, Robert James Baker, named a species of bat after her, the <em>Micronycteris giovanniae</em>. She was the author of more than 30 books — many for children — three of which were best sellers. Her newest book, “The New Book: Poems, Letters, Blurbs, and Things,” is expected to be published next year. </p><p>In addition to Ms. Fowler, Ms. Giovanni is survived by her son, Thomas, and a granddaughter.</p><p>“I really like what the young people are doing,” Ms. Giovanni told The Times in 2020, reflecting on the Black Lives Matter movement, and the work of her students, “and I think my job is to be sure to get out of their way, but also let them know, if it means anything to them, that I’m proud of them.”</p><p>“I recommend old age,” she added. “There’s just nothing as wonderful as knowing you have done your job.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
