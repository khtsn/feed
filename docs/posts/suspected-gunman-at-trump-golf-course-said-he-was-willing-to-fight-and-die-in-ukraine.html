Trump</a>, had expressed the desire to fight and die in Ukraine.</p><p>Mr. Routh’s posts on the social media site X revealed a penchant for violent rhetoric in the weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. “I AM WILLING TO FLY TO KRAKOW AND GO TO THE BORDER OF UKRAINE TO VOLUNTEER AND FIGHT AND DIE,” he wrote.</p><p>On the messaging application Signal, Mr. Routh wrote that “Civilians must change this war and prevent future wars” as part of his profile bio. On WhatsApp, his bio read, “Each one of us must do our part daily in the smallest steps help support human rights, freedom and democracy; we each must help the chinese.”</p><p>Mr. Routh, a former roofing contractor from Greensboro, N.C., was interviewed by The New York Times in 2023 for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/25/world/europe/volunteers-us-ukraine-lies.html" title="">an article about Americans volunteering to aid the war effort in Ukraine</a>. Mr. Routh, who had no military experience, said he had traveled to the country after Russia’s invasion and wanted to recruit Afghan soldiers to fight there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a telephone interview with The New York Times in 2023, when Mr. Routh was in Washington, he spoke with the self-assuredness of a seasoned diplomat who thought his plans to support Ukraine’s war effort were sure to succeed. But he appeared to have little patience for anyone who got in his way. When an American foreign fighter seemed to talk down to him in a Facebook message he shared with The New York Times, Mr. Routh said, “he needs to be shot.”</p><p>In the interview, Mr. Routh said he was in Washington to meet with the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, known as the Helsinki Commission “for two hours” to help push for more support for Ukraine. The commission is led by members of Congress and <a href="https://www.csce.gov/our-history/public-law-establishing-commission/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">staffed by congressional aides</a>. It is influential on matters of democracy and security and has been vocal in supporting Ukraine.</p><p>Mr. Routh also said he was seeking recruits for Ukraine from among Afghan soldiers who had fled the Taliban. He said he planned to move them, in some cases illegally, from Pakistan and Iran to Ukraine. He said dozens had expressed interest.</p><p>“We can probably purchase some passports through Pakistan, since it’s such a corrupt country,” he said.</p><p>It is not clear whether Mr. Routh followed through, but one former Afghan soldier said he had been contacted and was interested in fighting if it meant leaving Iran, where he was living illegally.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A man with the same name and similar age as Mr. Routh was arrested in 2002 in Greensboro, N.C., after barricading himself inside a building with a fully automatic weapon, according to the Greensboro News &amp; Record newspaper.</p><p>The newspaper said the man was charged with carrying a concealed weapon and possession of a fully automatic machine gun. It is not clear how the charges were resolved.</p><p>It is not clear if Mr. Routh, a lean man with reddish-brown hair who wore American flag clothing in one of his profile pictures, fired any shots before leaving the scene on Sunday, according to the Secret Service.</p><p>In a series of posts on X in 2020, Mr. Routh expressed admiration for former Representative Tulsi Gabbard, then a Democratic presidential candidate, saying “she will tirelessly negotiate peace deals in Syria, Afghanistan, and all turmoil zones.”</p><p>At some point over the past several years, Mr. Routh moved to Hawaii, where a man with his name ran a small business.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a May 2020 post, he invited Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, to Hawaii for a vacation and offered to act as “ambassador and liaison” to resolve disputes between the two nations.</p><p>When deputies stopped him on Interstate 95 after the incident, Mr. Routh appeared calm, did not ask why he was being detained, and “was not armed when we took him out of the car,” Sheriff William D. Snyder of Martin County told a local station, <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/trump/donald-trump-reported-safe-after-gunshots-near-trump-international-golf-club" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WPTV</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Goldman writes about the F.B.I. and national security.
