Trump.</p><p>In a series of open letters, the group noted that Mr. Biden campaigned on opposing capital punishment. Mr. Trump supports the death penalty and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/daniel-lewis-lee-execution-crime.html" title="">restarted federal executions</a> after a nearly 20-year pause during his first term.</p><p>“As your time in office comes to a close, there is an unprecedented need for you to cement your commitment to remedying injustices by exercising executive clemency and commuting the death sentences of those on federal death row,” one of the letters said.</p><p>The letters on Monday aligned with a larger effort by congressional Democrats and others to persuade Mr. Biden to use his clemency power to commute death sentences to life sentences without parole and to free people serving disproportionally long drug sentences.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said last week that Mr. Biden was expected to make more clemency announcements “at the end of his term.”</p><p>“He’s thinking through that process very thoroughly,” Ms. Jean-Pierre said.</p><p>Presidents typically order a round of pardons toward the end of their time in office. Earlier this month, Mr. Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/us/politics/biden-pardon-son-hunter.html" title="">issued a full and unconditional pardon of his son Hunter</a> — after repeatedly insisting he would not do so — erasing years of legal troubles, including a federal conviction for illegally buying a gun and for tax evasion.</p><p>Sweeping clemency for inmates on death row could anger those who feel capital punishment is warranted for convictions after heinous crimes, such as killing nine Black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, or 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue.</p><p>Mr. Biden did issue a moratorium on executions when he came into office. But his Justice Department has continued to prosecute death penalty cases, and Mr. Trump had indicated he would continue executions once he returns to the White House.</p><p>Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, one of the president’s closest allies, joined more than 60 other Democrats in <a href="https://pressley.house.gov/2024/11/20/pressley-clyburn-scanlon-colleagues-urge-biden-to-use-clemency-power-to-address-mass-incarceration-before-leaving-office/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sending a letter</a> to Mr. Biden last month urging him to use his clemency powers in his final months to address decades of disparities that led to mass incarceration of Black people and other vulnerable populations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In an interview, Mr. Clyburn said Mr. Biden had the opportunity to rectify the injustice of decades of harsh sentences that have disproportionately affected Black people.</p><p>“You got people in Colorado getting wealthy now because we changed the name from marijuana to cannabis, and now it’s fine to grow cannabis, but you go to jail and get a record that you’re saddled with if it were marijuana,” Mr. Clyburn said.</p><p>As a senator, Mr. Biden championed a 1994 crime bill that many experts say fueled mass incarceration. He has since expressed regret for his support of the legislation, and he committed during the 2020 campaign to addressing the long drug sentences that resulted.</p><p>Mr. Clyburn, who recommended that Mr. Biden pardon his son and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/biden-trump-pardons.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">issue blanket pardons</a> to protect against political retribution by Mr. Trump, said he wanted Mr. Biden to show similar empathy for those serving time in prison.</p><p>“I wouldn’t ask him to do for my constituents something that should not also apply to his own son,” Mr. Clyburn said. “That’s what I told him.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He added: “Do what you learned in those Catholic schools you grew up in. I’m asking Joe Biden to show some compassion.”</p><p>Mr. Biden so far has been relatively reserved in his ability to pardon federal crimes or reduce sentences through what is known as a commutation.</p><p>The Office of the Pardon Attorney, part of the Justice Department, has received nearly 12,000 requests for clemency during Mr. Biden’s term. The president has so far issued 161 clemency grants — 26 pardons and 135 commutations — according to a tally kept by the pardon attorney.</p><p>That is fewer than the 238 — 144 pardons and 94 commutations — that Mr. Trump issued during his first administration.</p><p>Mr. Biden has also issued what is known as blanket pardons to wipe clean the records of those convicted of marijuana possession. None of those people were in prison when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/06/us/politics/biden-marijuana-pardon.html" title="">Mr. Biden made that announcement in 2022</a>. He also has pardoned military veterans who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/us/politics/biden-pardon-veterans-gay-sex.html" title="">had been convicted of having gay sex</a>, a crime under military law until 2013.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Some activists are now pushing Mr. Biden to use the power to allow federal inmates who were moved to home confinement during the Covid emergency to stay there. Some congressional Republicans, who are set to take control of Congress next month, have tried to push legislation that would have forced those people to return to prison.</p><p>Other Democrats say Mr. Biden must focus on those serving long drug sentences after legislation stalled in Congress that would have eliminated the current 18-to-1 disparity in sentencing for crack cocaine versus powder.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zolan Kanno-Youngs is a White House correspondent, covering President Biden and his administration.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zolan-kanno-youngs">More about Zolan Kanno-Youngs</a></span></p></div><div><p>Erica L.
