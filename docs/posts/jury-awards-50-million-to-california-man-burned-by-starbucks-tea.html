Video from inside the store captured the episode and shows Mr. Garcia writhing in pain as he pulls away.</p><p>The company “did not securely fasten the lids of each hot beverage that were negligently, carelessly and recklessly served” to Mr. Garcia, the complaint said.</p><p>His lawyers said the experience left him with third-degree burns to his penis, groin and inner thighs, and he was transported to an emergency room.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/16/multimedia/16xp-starbucks2/16xp-starbucks2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/16/multimedia/16xp-starbucks2/16xp-starbucks2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/16/multimedia/16xp-starbucks2/16xp-starbucks2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="The exterior of a Starbucks with a sign advertising a drive-through." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/16/multimedia/16xp-starbucks2/16xp-starbucks2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/16/multimedia/16xp-starbucks2/16xp-starbucks2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/16/multimedia/16xp-starbucks2/16xp-starbucks2-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/16/multimedia/16xp-starbucks2/16xp-starbucks2-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1357w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/8199d5fc-d590-5496-a2df-9316af230c8d" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Garcia’s lawsuit claimed that a barista who was stationed at the window “negligently failed to properly” secure one of the hot drinks into a drink carrier, causing it to fall into his lap.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Google Maps</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Since he was hospitalized and treated, he “has lived for five years with the disfigurement, pain, dysfunction and psychological harm caused by the burns,” his lawyers said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a statement on Sunday, Starbucks said that although it sympathized with Mr. Garcia, the company planned to appeal the jury’s award.</p><p>“We disagree with the jury’s decision that we were at fault for this incident and believe the damages awarded to be excessive,” Jaci Anderson, director of corporate communications, said in the statement.</p><p>She added, “We have always been committed to the highest safety standards in our stores, including the handling of hot drinks.”</p><p>The damages cover physical pain, mental suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, humiliation, inconvenience, grief, disfigurement, physical impairment and anxiety, according to the jury award.</p><p>The award is expected to total more than $60 million after interest, attorneys’ fees and costs are added, his lawyers said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The lawsuit is reminiscent of another well-known, fast-food-related burn case.
