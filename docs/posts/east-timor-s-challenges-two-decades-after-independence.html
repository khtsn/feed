    <h1>East Timor’s Challenges Two Decades After Independence</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Three decades ago, he was a scrappy campaigner roaming the world’s corridors of power with a dream to win independence for his tiny homeland. Today, at 75, José Ramos-Horta is both the president and a relentless salesman for East Timor.</p><p>He asked China’s president, Xi Jinping, to “help us resolve the problem of agriculture, food security and poverty.” He pleaded with Vietnam’s leaders to do the same. He pitched Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the ruler of the United Arab Emirates, his dream of building student dormitories.</p><p>Mr. Ramos-Horta is under mounting pressure to sustain his nation — Asia’s youngest and <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2024/02/27/timor-leste-economic-grow-forecast-to-pick-up-in-2024-2025-amid-easing-inflation-stable-fiscal-outlook" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of its poorest</a>. Home to about 1.4 million people, East Timor is one half of an island that lies near the northern tip of Australia; the other half is part of Indonesia. A Portuguese colony for centuries, it emerged as an independent state in 2002 after a brutal occupation by Indonesia. Its roughly $2 billion economy remains heavily reliant on oil and gas revenue, which is evaporating quickly, and more than 40 percent of its people are estimated to live in poverty.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/11/multimedia/00easttimor-03-wvkh/00easttimor-03-wvkh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/11/multimedia/00easttimor-03-wvkh/00easttimor-03-wvkh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/11/multimedia/00easttimor-03-wvkh/00easttimor-03-wvkh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A woman with a broom in a small passageway between tin shacks." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/11/multimedia/00easttimor-03-wvkh/00easttimor-03-wvkh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/11/multimedia/00easttimor-03-wvkh/00easttimor-03-wvkh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/11/multimedia/00easttimor-03-wvkh/00easttimor-03-wvkh-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/11/multimedia/00easttimor-03-wvkh/00easttimor-03-wvkh-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/5a3a6a8a-e7b9-571d-bc0b-448258f1c49c" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>East Timor was briefly in the global spotlight last year when Pope Francis visited the country.

But, he added: “In 22 years, we should have resolved child poverty, child malnutrition, mother malnutrition and extreme poverty. So that has been a failure.”</p><p>Still, by other measures, East Timor, or Timor-Leste as it is known in Portuguese, is a success. It has strengthened its young democracy, holding competitive elections with multiple transfers of power. It ranks among the highest in Asia for press freedom. Life expectancy is <a href="https://www.unfpa.org/data/world-population/TL" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">around 70</a>, <a href="https://data.who.int/countries/626" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">up from around 64</a> in 2002. The entire population now <a href="https://trackingsdg7.esmap.org/country/timor-leste" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has access to electricity</a>.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/12/world/asia/12timor.html" title="">politically motivated violence</a> followed independence, including an assassination attempt on Mr. Ramos-Horta in 2008, during his first term as president, the country is stable now.</p><p>East Timor is a positive case study for young post-conflict states, said Parker Novak, an Indo-Pacific expert at the Atlantic Council. “They’ve built a fairly resilient democracy. That’s something they’re very proud of, and rightfully so.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In September, a visit by Pope Francis briefly put East Timor in the global spotlight. About 97 percent of the population identifies as Roman Catholic, a legacy of the Portuguese colonizers and, more recently, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/world/asia/pope-east-timor-legacy.html" title="">pivotal role the church played</a> in winning independence from Indonesia. Some clergy fought for independence, and bishops and nuns protected people from Indonesian forces.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pope Francis visited Dili in September.

The prime minister, Xanana Gusmão, was out with a broom.</p><p>For one of the least visited countries in Asia, it was a major moment. Outside of Dili, the major population center, East Timor still feels like an untouched paradise. Tall, lush mountains are surrounded by wide expanses of azure seas. There are few people on its white sandy beaches.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Francis’ arrival also resurrected memories of a tainted past. Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, one of the heroes of the independence movement, was accused in 2022 of having <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/29/world/asia/vatican-bishop-belo.html" title="">sexually abused children</a> decades ago.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The pope’s visit was a big moment for the East Timor, which is one of the least-visited countries in Asia.

Bishop Belo was later accused of having sexually abused children decades ago.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Few Timorese speak up about Bishop Belo, who remains widely revered. Mr. Ramos-Horta, who was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 along with Bishop Belo for their work to win independence, said the matter had “already been addressed years ago by the Vatican” and that any restitution had already been made between the church and the victims.</p><h2 id="link-dc4cbb7">The China Factor</h2><p>At the grounds of the presidential palace in Dili, members of the public stroll in freely and sit in the lush gardens.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>It was all made possible by China.</p><p>Beijing <a href="https://china.aiddata.org/projects/35330/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gave nearly $7 million</a> to build the palace, which opened in 2009. (The U.S. dollar is the official currency here.) Less than a mile away are the defense and foreign ministries, both also built by China.</p><p>Mr. Ramos-Horta recounted how he had asked the Chinese ambassador for help in providing clean water.</p><p>“Even before I went to China, Chinese engineers were coming to Timor already, to look at the water sources for irrigation and water supply to communities,” he said. “The Chinese, they deliver very fast.”</p><p>This reliance on China has triggered fears about Beijing’s intentions in East Timor, and what it could mean for the United States, which has stepped up its troop presence in the Australian port city of Darwin, just a few hundred miles from East Timor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“When China looks at investing in another developing country, they do so with one eye, certainly on a viable business, but with the other eye, very much on a longer-term strategic interest,” said Damien Kingsbury, an emeritus professor at Deakin University in Australia.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Goats for sale in a dried-up riverbed in Dili in September.

He added that East Timor does not borrow money from China, and that the only military security arrangement it has is with Australia.</p><h2 id="link-2769ce75">Not ‘Hostages of the Past’</h2><p>Mr. Ramos-Horta is fond of sharing anecdotes. One was about bumping into Indonesia’s president, Prabowo Subianto, in Singapore in July. Mr. Prabowo asked after Mr. Ramos-Horta’s younger brother, a close friend of his.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“That’s the level of the friendship we have with Indonesian leaders,” Mr. Ramos-Horta said.</p><p>The same Mr. Prabowo who led the feared Kopassus special forces unit that slaughtered hundreds in East Timor during the Indonesian occupation?</p><p>The Indonesian military moved in days after the Portuguese left in 1975, after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/20/news/ford-and-kissinger-had-bigger-problems-we-will-understand-and-will-not.html" title="">United States had greenlighted the invasion</a>. They killed, according to some estimates, as many as 200,000 people before allowing a referendum in 1999. Mr. Ramos-Horta lost four siblings.</p><p>Still, in recognition of Indonesia honoring the results of the referendum, Mr. Ramos-Horta said he and Mr. Gusmão, the prime minister, decided that they would not allow “ourselves to be hostages of the past.”</p><p>“We honor the victims. We bury the dead, but we look forward.”</p><p>He recounted how when he and Mr. Gusmão first heard that Mr. Prabowo had been elected, Mr. Gusmão “was very happy” and gave him a thumbs up.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President José Ramos-Horta is currently serving his second five-year term.

He is one of the many heroes of independence who remain in government.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“Those who were here, during the difficult time, they have the greatest emotional connection” to East Timor, Mr. Ramos-Horta said, adding that such people would be more supportive of the country’s stability.</p><h2 id="link-145dc7a5">Familiar Challenges</h2><p>A quarter-century after the Indonesians left, many of East Timor’s independence heroes remain in government. While Mr. Gusmão fought in the jungles, Mr. Ramos-Horta spent decades in exile, lobbying for freedom. He has served as foreign minister, prime minister and is now in his second term as president.</p><p>“People feel obligated to them, they liberated the country from a horrendous military occupation,” said Charles Scheiner, a researcher at La’o Hamutuk, a local advocacy group. “Everybody in this country has family who was killed by the Indonesian military, and many of them are survivors of torture and rape.”</p><p>But winning sovereignty is different from running a country.</p><p>Analysts say that instead of using the revenues from oil and gas to improve decrepit schools and develop fishing and farming industries, officials channeled them into creating an inflated bureaucracy and paying those involved in the post-independence violence big pensions to “buy peace.” The World Bank has warned that East Timor is heading toward a <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/55296a24-5422-47e9-bb36-ccb63a7f92b6/content" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“damaging fiscal cliff”</a> by 2035.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-30"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Experts say that the leaders of East Timor have failed to invest in schools.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-32"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Agostinho Ribeiro makes a living as a fisherman.

While coffee remains a major export, Mr. Ramos-Horta speaks effusively of developing East Timor as an air cargo or pharmaceuticals hub. He also hopes to join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to make regional trade easier.</p><p>The odds are long. Negotiations for the Greater Sunrise field are continuing, and it is expected to take at least five years of development before generating any revenue. Tourism remains untapped because of few commercial flights. Internet speeds still crawl.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>About 25 minutes away from Dili, in the village of Ulmera, Alda Bisoi Correia, 74, recalled why she voted for independence.
