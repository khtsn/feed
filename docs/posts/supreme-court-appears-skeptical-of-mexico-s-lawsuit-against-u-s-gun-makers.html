criminal gangs. Arguing that the violence was a direct result of the gun makers’ actions, a lawyer for Mexico told the justices that the country should be able to sue despite a 2005 law that prohibited most lawsuits against gun manufacturers for injuries caused by firearms.</p><p>But Justice Brett M.

Earlier in the day, the Trump administration put <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/business/economy/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china.html" title="">stiff U.S. tariffs into effect</a> against Mexico. President Trump has cited <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/world/americas/mexico-cartel-fentanyl-trump-tariffs.html" title="">drug trafficking</a> from Mexico into the United States as one of the reasons for his decision to impose trade penalties and has sought to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/us/politics/state-dept-terrorist-designation.html" title="">designate cartels as terrorist groups</a>.</p><p>Filed in 2021, the case, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/23-1141.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Smith &amp; Wesson Brands v. Estados Unidos Mexicanos</a>, No. 23-1141, has allowed the Mexican government an avenue for a counterargument — that U.S. gun companies share in the blame for violence by drug cartels because their guns make their way to Mexican crime scenes. Mexico asked for some $10 billion in damages. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/supreme-court-mexico-lawsuit-gun-makers.html" title="">trial court judge dismissed</a> Mexico’s case against six of the defendants on other grounds, leaving the Supreme Court’s decision in the case to apply to claims against Smith &amp; Wesson, a gun manufacturer, and Interstate Arms, a wholesaler.</p><p>Access to guns is tightly controlled in Mexico, and it is nearly impossible for civilians to legally obtain the kinds of military-style weapons favored by the cartels. Lawyers for Mexico have cited statistics showing that a majority of guns from Mexican crime scenes — between 70 and 90 percent — come from the United States. They also contend that gun dealers in the states that border Mexico sell twice as many weapons as dealers in other parts of the United States.</p><p>Noel J. Francisco, a lawyer representing the gun industry who also served as solicitor general during the first Trump administration, argued that the industry was specifically insulated against such lawsuits by the 2005 federal law, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/21/politics/congress-passes-new-legal-shield-for-gun-industry.html" title="">legislation</a>, which was passed after a growing number of lawsuits aimed to hold the gun industry liable in domestic mass shootings, prohibits many types of suits against gun manufacturers and sellers.</p><p>“Congress’s entire purpose was to prohibit lawsuits just like this one,” Mr. Francisco said. “It was trying to prohibit lawsuits that had been brought by the city of Chicago, the city of Cincinnati, the city of Boston, on theories and seeking relief, exactly like this one.”</p><p>But the law includes a carve out for claims to proceed if plaintiffs can show that their injuries were directly caused by knowing violations of firearms laws. Mexico argued that its case falls under that exception.</p><p>During the argument, Catherine E. Stetson, the lawyer who argued for Mexico, said some U.S. manufacturers have designed specific weapons to appeal to Mexican buyers. In court filings, lawyers for Mexico referred to a special edition .38 pistol engraved with the face of the Mexican revolutionary hero Emiliano Zapata with a quotation that has been attributed to him: “It is better to die standing than to live on your knees.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-7"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p><div data-testid="transcript-playback-controls"><div><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 36" id="el_0kpS9qL_S"><title>bars</title><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_65hRV2Qwn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_ILVvi2tqx" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC"><rect x="34" width="6" height="36" id="el_qw_T_tngXw"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_p_9Pm85Ac" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_WxG3R40yd" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU"><rect x="22.67" width="6" height="36" id="el_lf9GrROk6j"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_kYNRGDfcw" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_3c3bzSjOJ" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw"><rect x="11.33" width="6" height="36" id="el_-iueO8klO0"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_y_fKcpSxn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_R6bNB6_Ys" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC"><rect width="6" height="36" id="el_dS5TKNZZ5w"></rect></g></g></g></svg></p><div><div><p>0:00</p><!-- --><p>/</p><!-- --><p>0:54</p></div><div><p>-</p><!-- --><p>0:00</p></div></div></div></div></header><div><p>transcript</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>I think it’s not so much that the defendants are designing a particular gun. It’s that what the complaint alleges is that they are designing certain guns to target the Mexican market, including the cartels. So if you take the example that you gave, this is paragraph 215, Colt produces three models of guns that it specifically targets to the Mexican market: the Super El Jefe, the Super El Grito and the Emiliano Zapata 1911. These are coveted by the cartels, and you can see evidence of this as paragraphs 217, 218, 219, 220, and they are smuggled into Mexico in volume, which you can also find in the —— “Do you know what the percentage of those guns that are sold in the United States, compared to the ones that are found in Mexico is?” I don’t know. But, again, the percentage, I think, is less important than the allegation that they are smuggled into Mexico in volume and coveted by the cartels, including being found on the person of many cartel chiefs who have been arrested.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/04/us/politics/SCOTUS-SQ/SCOTUS-SQ-square640.png" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Mexico is not trying to legislate gun use in the United States,” Ms. Stetson said.</p><p>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson questioned Mexico’s argument, saying that she read the 2005 law as “about Congress protecting its own prerogative to be the one to regulate this industry.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-10"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p><div data-testid="transcript-playback-controls"><div><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 36" id="el_0kpS9qL_S"><title>bars</title><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_65hRV2Qwn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_ILVvi2tqx" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC"><rect x="34" width="6" height="36" id="el_qw_T_tngXw"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_p_9Pm85Ac" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_WxG3R40yd" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU"><rect x="22.67" width="6" height="36" id="el_lf9GrROk6j"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_kYNRGDfcw" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_3c3bzSjOJ" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw"><rect x="11.33" width="6" height="36" id="el_-iueO8klO0"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_y_fKcpSxn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_R6bNB6_Ys" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC"><rect width="6" height="36" id="el_dS5TKNZZ5w"></rect></g></g></g></svg></p><div><div><p>0:00</p><!-- --><p>/</p><!-- --><p>0:26</p></div><div><p>-</p><!-- --><p>0:00</p></div></div></div></div></header><div><p>transcript</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>I really thought, as the statute itself says, that it partially, at least, is about Congress protecting its own prerogative to be the one to regulate this industry.

Mexico says that U.S. gun manufacturers are contributing to illegal conduct in Mexico. There are Americans who think that Mexican government officials are contributing to a lot of illegal conduct here. So suppose that one of the 50 states sued the government of Mexico for aiding and abetting illegal conduct within the state’s borders that causes the state to incur law enforcement costs, public welfare costs, other costs. Would your client be willing to litigate that case in the courts of the United States?” “I can’t and certainly don’t feel comfortable giving away things like sovereign immunity on behalf of the government of Mexico.” “Well, I understand that. So the argument basically is it’s a one-way street.” – “No, Justice Alito, I don’t —” – “The government of Mexico can sue U.S. manufacturers here for harm caused in Mexico, but one of the states here can’t sue the government of Mexico for harm caused in the United States.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/04/04vid-SCOTUS-mexico-guns-96261-cover/04vid-SCOTUS-mexico-guns-96261-cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div></section><div><div><div><p>Abbie VanSickle covers the United States Supreme Court for The Times.
