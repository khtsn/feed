In both, parents challenged changes to admissions criteria at public schools that did not directly take account of race in trying to diversify enrollment. Whether such indirect efforts are constitutional is a question left open by the court’s decision last year striking down the admissions plans at Harvard and the University of North Carolina, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard College</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In Boston, school officials replaced admissions criteria based on grades and test scores with one that largely allocated seats across ZIP codes based on grades within each. Under the new standards, the share of Black students grew to 23 percent from 14 percent while the share of white students dropped to 31 percent from 40 percent.</p><p>Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, dissented. The schools’ plan, he wrote, “is racial balancing by another name and is undoubtedly unconstitutional.”</p><p>“We have now twice refused to correct a glaring constitutional error that threatens to perpetuate race-based affirmative action in defiance of Students for Fair Admissions,” he added, referring to the case from Virginia. “I would reject root and branch this dangerously distorted view.”</p><p>In a separate statement, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch wrote that he shared Justice Alito’s concerns but said that later changes to the schools’ admission criteria, not challenged in the pending lawsuit, “greatly diminish the need for our review.”</p><p>Justice Alito, again joined by Justice Thomas, also dissented from the court’s decision not to hear a challenge to a “gender identity support” policy of the Eau Claire Area School District that he said “encourages a student to transition to a new gender or assists in that process” without parents’ knowledge or consent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Lower courts said the parents seeking to challenge the policy lacked standing because they could not show that their children were transitioning or thinking about it, citing a 2013 opinion from Justice Alito that rejected a challenge to a government surveillance program from journalists and human rights lawyers. Their fear that they would be subject to surveillance in the future, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/us/politics/supreme-court-rejects-challenge-to-fisa-surveillance-law.html" title="">Justice Alito wrote at the time</a>, was too speculative to establish standing.</p><p>On Monday, Justice Alito said the court should have granted review of the new case given “parents’ fundamental constitutional right to make decisions concerning the rearing of their children.”</p><p>In the case argued on Wednesday, the court said it would not address whether parents have a constitutional right to direct their children’s medical care.</p><p>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said he would have granted review in the case from Wisconsin. He did not join Justice Alito’s dissent or give reasons of his own.</p><p>The case from Hawaii concerned Christopher Wilson, who was charged with carrying a gun in public without a license. He sought to dismiss the charge, citing the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen</a>, which, in striking down New York’s strict firearms licensing law, noted that Hawaii had a similar one.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Hawaii Supreme Court ruled against Mr. Wilson, saying he lacked standing because he had never applied for a license.</p><p>“That conclusion,” Justice Thomas wrote on Monday, “contravenes the settled principle that Americans need not engage in empty formalities before they can invoke their constitutional rights, and it wrongly reduces the Second Amendment to a second-class right.”</p><p>But Justice Thomas said the U.S. Supreme Court had been right to deny review, as the case against Mr. Wilson was at an early stage.</p><p>“In an appropriate case, however,” he wrote, “we should make clear that Americans are always free to invoke the Second Amendment as a defense against unconstitutional firearms-licensing schemes.”</p><p>Justice Alito joined Justice Thomas’s statement. Justice Gorsuch issued his own statement, saying he was troubled by “the distinct possibility that Mr. Wilson may be convicted of, and ordered to serve time in prison for, violating an unconstitutional law.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Liptak covers the Supreme Court and writes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/sidebar">Sidebar,</a> a column on legal developments.
