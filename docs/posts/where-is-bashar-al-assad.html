It marked a dramatic breakthrough for rebel factions in Syria that have been trying to unseat him for more than a decade, much of which was marked by a devastating civil war.</p><div><p>For many in Syria, Mr. al-Assad’s fall was a moment filled with hope as they no longer feared the regime that had used oppressive tactics to quash their freedoms. But it was also rife with uncertainty over who will rule Syria next and raised fears of a power vacuum in a country that has been rived with competing factions vying for control of different areas of territory.</p><p>“Our hearts are dancing with joy,” Walaa Salameh, 35, a resident of the Damascus area, said in a phone interview. “We can’t predict the future and anything is possible, but the most important thing is we got rid of this oppressive regime.”</p><p>The Russian Foreign Ministry’s statement did not offer details on Mr. al-Assad’s location. Two senior Western officials who were not authorized to speak publicly because of the sensitivity of the situation said there were indications that he had left for Russia. There was no immediate comment from the Syrian presidency about his whereabouts.</p><p>Earlier Sunday, the main rebel coalition, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-hts-who-what.html" title="">Hayat Tahrir al-Sham</a>, had announced on its Telegram channel that it had taken the capital, Damascus, and that Syrian forces were withdrawing. </p><p>State television went from trumpeting Mr. al-Assad’s strong defenses to broadcasting an announcement by a group of nine rebels on Sunday: “The city of Damascus has been liberated, the tyrant Bashar al-Assad has been toppled,” one of them read out, adding. “Long live a free and independent Syria for all Syrians of all sects.”</p><p>The events capped a startling two weeks in which the coalition of rebel groups that had been pinned down in a small corner of Syria’s northwest seized the country’s major cities, shattering a stalemate in Syria’s 13-year civil war.</p><p>“No one should shed any tears over the end of the Assad regime,” Daniel B. Shapiro, the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, said in Bahrain.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Who are the rebels?:</strong> After attracting little notice for years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-leader-interview.html" title="">Abu Mohammad al-Jolani</a> spearheaded the offensive that led to the fall of Mr. al-Assad’s regime. First, the rebels seized Syria’s largest city, Aleppo, then days later blazed through Hama and the strategic city of Homs, en route to the capital.</p></li><li><p><strong>Assad’s location:</strong> Amid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus#the-location-of-bashar-al-assad-remains-unclear" title="">swirling questions over Mr. al-Assad’s whereabouts</a>, Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali, Syria’s prime minister, said that he had not spoken with him since Saturday. Mr. al-Jalali said that he would stay in the country and was ready to work with whomever Syrians choose as their leader. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham said it would work with Mr. al-Jalali and called on Syrian military forces in Damascus to stay away from public institutions, which it said would remain under the prime minister’s supervision until they are formally handed over.</p></li><li><p><strong>Assad’s allies:</strong> Mr. al-Assad had kept rebel forces at bay for more than a decade with Iranian and Russian military support. But in recent days, Iran and Russia appeared to be turning to diplomacy to preserve their interests in the country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/07/world/syria-war-damascus#russia-an-assad-ally-is-unlikely-to-come-to-his-aid" title="">rather than significant military support</a>. The Foreign Ministry of Iran <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus/f9cf3610-88a7-51ae-8fef-0a4911e58eef?smid=url-share" title="">said decision-making</a> about the future of Syria was “solely the responsibility” of Syrians. Mr. al-Assad’s fall has <a href="#assads-fall-deprives-hezbollah-of-a-key-ally" title="">deprived</a> Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group and political party, of a key ally.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prisoners freed: </strong>As the rebels advanced, they took over many of the notorious prisons where the Assad regime has for decades imprisoned, tortured and executed political prisoners. Videos emerging from north of Damascus show groups of men walking through city streets at night, reportedly after being freed from Sednaya Prison, which the rebels have taken, according to war monitors and the fighters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Broader instability:</strong> Israel’s military said it had <a href="#israel-says-it-has-entered-the-demilitarized-buffer-zone-in-the-golan-heights" title="">entered a demilitarized buffer zone</a> in territory it controls in the Golan Heights, abutting Syria. The Israeli military, which is concerned about the sudden surge in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-damascus-iran.html" title="">instability near its borders,</a> said it was acting to protect Israeli civilians. Iraq has secured its border with Syria, according to the official Iraqi News Agency, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus/999e405d-4bf2-51f0-8672-2fd646a96a0c?smid=url-share" title="">said</a> on Sunday that the Al-Qaim border crossing was closed.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="42" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvODZhMTM2NTUtMTYxZS01ZDBjLWI1ZjMtMjRkMmQzMWYzNWFm"><div id="86a13655-161e-5d0c-b5f3-24d2d31f35af" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus#86a13655-161e-5d0c-b5f3-24d2d31f35af"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/peter-baker"><img alt="Peter Baker" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/peter-baker/peter-baker-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/peter-baker/peter-baker-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/peter-baker/peter-baker-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-12-08T17:44:37.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Dec. 8, 2024, 12:44 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>President Biden will make a televised statement on Syria at 1 p.m. Eastern, according to the White House.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="41" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2E2MGU3MzYxLTI2NjEtNTA0Ni05ODY1LWFkYmM2MzhlNTlkZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus#syria-rebels-assad-aleppo" data-source-id="100000009865866"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/raja-abdulrahim"><img alt="Raja Abdulrahim" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/06/reader-center/author-raja-abdulrahim/author-raja-abdulrahim-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/06/reader-center/author-raja-abdulrahim/author-raja-abdulrahim-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/06/reader-center/author-raja-abdulrahim/author-raja-abdulrahim-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-12-08T17:39:03.977Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Dec. 8, 2024, 12:39 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Celebrations in Aleppo, Syria, on Sunday after hearing that President Bashar al-Assad’s 24-year authoritarian rule has ended.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karam Al-Masri/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Much of Syria was overjoyed on Sunday after the stunning ouster of President Bashar al-Assad as rebels breached the capital, Damascus, after a lightning fast offensive. But a big question hangs over the celebrations: What comes next?</p><p>Asked the question, a media official with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham — the Islamist rebel group behind the offensive — was surprised. He said it was time for celebrations and talk of bureaucracy would come later.</p><div><p>But in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-leader-interview.html" title="">interview</a> last week, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the group’s leader, said that even before Hayat Tahrir al-Sham launched its offensive, the group was thinking about its next steps.</p><p>The northern city of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/world/middleeast/syria-aleppo-rebels-control.html" title="">Aleppo</a>, which rebels captured on Nov. 30 just fours days into their surprise offensive, suggests that big changes might not come immediately.</p><p>Hayat Tahrir al-Shaman, which was once linked to Al Qaeda but broke ties in 2016, has controlled most of the northwestern Syrian province of Idlib for years, and he and his administration have come under criticism for its authoritarian tactics and cracking down on dissent. The group has tried to <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/jawlanis-state-union" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gain legitimacy</a> by providing services to residents in Idlib.</p><p>Across Syria, the rebel group sought to reassure residents that it would safeguard public property and institutions. After taking much of Aleppo, its fighters moved on to the next front line, leaving the city to technocrats who came to preserve government institutions, Mr. al-Jolani said.</p><p>His group said that public institutions would remain under the oversight of the country’s prime minister until there was a transition.</p><p>Once Syria’s commercial hub, Aleppo’s factories and industries were severely hit during the years that rebels and regime forces fought over it, and many there were concerned about the economic impact of a new government. Within days of the rebels taking the city, the price of a microbus ride quadrupled from 1,000 Syrian pounds to 4,000 amid fuel shortages.</p><p>The rebel group tried to assure people in the city that they were in safe hands. At one intersection, a large billboard featured the finance minister for the government connected with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. “Be assured people of Aleppo,” the banner read, “and especially the shop owners and economic and industrial enterprises that your property and your money is protected.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="38" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvOGQ4MjRiNzktZjMzOC01YmE5LTlkZDMtYjU1MzZlM2Y2ZmMz"><div id="8d824b79-f338-5ba9-9dd3-b5536e3f6fc3" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus#8d824b79-f338-5ba9-9dd3-b5536e3f6fc3"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon"><img alt="Adam Rasgon" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-12-08T17:35:42.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Dec. 8, 2024, 12:35 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Speaking at the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the Islamist rebel leader who spearheaded the lightning offensive that toppled the Assad regime, declared the achievement of “a victory for the whole Islamic nation” and said Syria was “regaining its health.” The Assad regime had brought many ills upon Syria, he said, including sectarianism and corruption, and left the country to become “a farm for Iranian greed,” referring to one of al-Assad’s most important backers.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="37" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzU3YjJmNGRjLTU4M2UtNTQ0OC1hYTlkLTU4ODdkMTRkZWI1Ng=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus#syria-global-reactions-world-leaders" data-source-id="100000009865732"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/amelia-nierenberg"><img alt="Amelia Nierenberg" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/17/reader-center/author-amelia-nierenberg/author-amelia-nierenberg-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/17/reader-center/author-amelia-nierenberg/author-amelia-nierenberg-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/17/reader-center/author-amelia-nierenberg/author-amelia-nierenberg-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-12-08T17:19:04.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Dec. 8, 2024, 12:19 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Syrian opposition supporters at Faith Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey waved the opposition flag and celebrated the rebel takeover of Damascus on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erdem Sahin/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Global leaders reacted to the toppling of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria with cautious optimism and support for the Syrian people on Sunday.</p><p>They expressed hope that the country that has been roiled by more than a decade of civil war could unite in peace, even as fundamental questions remain about the country’s governance, including how the main rebel coalition would balance the competing interests of other forces that hold territory in Syria.</p><div><p>Here are the reactions from leaders and governments around the world as rebel forces claimed to have overthrown Mr. al-Assad, whom the Russian Foreign Ministry said had resigned and left the country.</p><p><strong>United Nations: </strong>“Today marks a watershed moment in Syria’s history,” the U.N. special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, said in a <a href="https://specialenvoysyria.unmissions.org/statement-united-nations-special-envoy-syria-mr-geir-o-pedersen" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>. He added that this “dark chapter” in the nation’s history had left deep scars, “but today we look forward with cautious hope to the opening of a new one — one of peace, reconciliation, dignity, and inclusion for all Syrians.”</p><p>Mr. Pedersen spoke of the grief that people have endured as their families have been displaced, killed and detained. And he urged “all Syrians to prioritize dialogue, unity, and respect for international humanitarian law and human rights as they seek to rebuild their society.”</p><p><strong>United States:</strong> Daniel Shapiro, the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, said “no one should shed any tears over the end of the Assad regime.” He said the United States would maintain a presence in eastern Syria “to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS” and will take all necessary measures to defend its forces in the area.</p><p>President-elect Donald J. Trump wrote in a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113615912452824634" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on Truth Social</a> that “Assad is gone. He has fled his country.” He added that Russia, which he called Mr. al-Assad’s “protector,” had lost interest because of its focus on Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Turkey: </strong>“Syria has reached a stage where the Syrian people will shape the future of their own country,” Hakan Fidan, the foreign minister, said in a speech in Qatar. “Today, there is hope.” He spoke about the importance of stability, unity and sovereignty in Syria, as well as the well-being of the Syrian people, noting that would allow millions of Syrians to return home. Turkey hosts more than three million Syrian refugees.</p><p><strong>France: </strong>President Emmanuel Macron wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/emmanuelmacron/status/1865729789459345502?s=46&amp;t=WiyCJ3iOZhKl5lJ3ldGVBA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a> that “the barbaric state has fallen.” He praised the courage and patience of the Syrian people. “In this moment of uncertainty, I send them my wishes for peace, freedom, and unity,” he said. “France will remain committed to the security of all in the Middle East.”</p><p><strong>European Union:</strong> Kaja Kallas, the bloc’s top diplomat, wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/kajakallas/status/1865735009770082422" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a> that the end of Mr. al-Assad’s “dictatorship is a positive and long-awaited development.” He added, “It also shows the weakness of Assad’s backers, Russia and Iran.”</p><p><strong>Iran: </strong>Although the country has long been among Mr. al-Assad’s staunchest supporters, its foreign ministry wrote in a <a href="https://twitter.com/IRIMFA_EN/status/1865748676569690203" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a> that “determining Syria’s future and making decisions about its destiny are solely the responsibility of the Syrian people, without any destructive interference or external imposition.”</p><p><strong>Israel: </strong>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel’s war against Hezbollah had caused a “chain reaction” that helped precipitate the collapse of Mr. al-Assad’s government. “The Assad regime, a key cell in Iran’s axis, has fallen. This the direct result of the blows we dealt Iran and Hezbollah,” he said.</p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia: </strong>The foreign ministry said in a statement that Saudi Arabia has expressed its “satisfaction with the positive steps” in Syria. Following the fall of the Assad government, the kingdom also called for “concerted efforts to preserve the unity of Syria and the cohesion of its people.” Saudi Arabia played a key role in bringing Mr. al-Assad <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/18/world/middleeast/syria-assad-arab-league.html" title="">back into the fold</a> of Arab leaders last year after more than a decade of global isolation.</p><p><strong>Ukraine: </strong>Andrii Sybiha, the foreign minister, wrote in a <a href="https://twitter.com/andrii_sybiha/status/1865737624213704756" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a> that Mr. al-Assad’s fall was the inevitable result of his bet on President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. “He always betrays those who rely on him,” Mr. Sybiha wrote.</p><p><strong>Afghanistan: </strong>The Taliban’s foreign ministry congratulated some of the rebels’ leaders in a statement <a href="https://twitter.com/MoFA_Afg/status/1865769129518522576/photo/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted to X</a> and also congratulated “the people of Syria,” saying the factor contributing to conflict and instability had been removed. It expressed hope that “the remaining phases of the revolution” would secure “a peaceful, unified and stable system.”</p><p><strong>United Arab Emirates: </strong>Anwar Gargash, a diplomatic adviser to President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, said that Mr. al-Assad “failed to use the lifelines thrown to him by various Arab countries.” Speaking to an audience of policymakers and reporters in Manama, the capital of Bahrain, Mr. Gargash said, “Ultimately there was this huge political failure, and we have seen this sort of rapid collapse of the regime, in part, because of the political failure.”</p><p><strong>Jordan: </strong>King Abdullah II said in a <a href="https://rhc.jo/en/media/news/king-national-security-council-meeting-says-jordan-stands-syrians-respects-their-will" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> that Jordan stands with the Syrian people and respects their will and choices. He stressed the need to maintain security and stability and avoid chaos — and spoke of the large number of Syrians who have moved to Jordan since the crisis began.</p><p><strong>Qatar: </strong>The foreign ministry said it would be necessary to preserve “national institutions and the unity of the state to prevent it from descending into chaos” in a <a href="https://twitter.com/MofaQatar_EN/status/1865734865892548897/photo/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a>.

Syria also has long borders with Iraq, where Iranian-backed militias have significant power, and with Lebanon, where Hezbollah built a major military force on Israel’s northern border.</p><p>Hezbollah could not have done that without Syria, since most of Hezbollah’s weapons reached Lebanon through the border, with Mr. al-Assad’s approval.</p><p>Hezbollah threw a lifeline to Mr. al-Assad earlier in the Syrian civil war, which began with an anti-Assad uprising in 2011, by sending thousands of fighters to prop up his exhausted military.

Mothers futilely tried to shield their children. After the strikes, rescue workers and ordinary Syrians rushed to tend to the wounded and bury the dead.</p><p>The planes and helicopters — which dropped<span>  </span>destructive barrel bombs filled with TNT and shrapnel — instilled terror. Only when the government captured an area did the airstrikes stop. But in the northwest, which remained a rebel stronghold, they continued until days ago.</p><p>On Sunday morning, for the first time in years, people who lived in fear of those bombs woke to silence in the skies.</p><p>“Always, that was our life during all those years,” said Hamid Qutaneh, a member of the White Helmets rescue group. He and the other members of the rescue team spent more than a decade responding to the aftermath of airstrikes by Syrian and Russian warplanes that were key to keeping President Bashar al-Assad in power.</p><p>Mr. Qutaneh, 30, a father of two, grew up in the northwest city of Khan Sheikhoun, which was hit by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/world/middleeast/syria-gas-attack.html" title="">chemical weapons</a> in 2017.</p><p>Warnings of airstrikes came in brief phrases or in one word: “The warplane has taken off.” “The warplane is flying overhead.” “Airstrike.”</p><p>Mr. Qutaneh’s own home in Khan Sheikhoun was destroyed in one of those strikes.</p><p>“You can’t imagine the joy today,” he said, adding that people for the first time were gathered in the streets in large crowds, no longer fearful that they could be targeted from the skies. “What happened is the beginning of the road to justice.”</p><p>More than 100,000 Syrians have been killed from airstrikes alone, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, a watchdog group.</p><p>“We are living a happiness that can’t be described,” Ramez Abu Farhan, 41, from the central city of Homs said after he returned home from celebrating in the city’s main square. “There is safety, there isn’t shelling; there aren’t airstrikes; there are no planes, and we are hopeful for the future.”</p><p>The city had not been hit with airstrikes for years after the Assad government regained control of it. But for years, he said, “we saw the shelling and the destruction.”</p><p>Even when planes weren’t carrying out airstrikes on his neighborhood, he said, he could hear them flying overhead, headed to drop their bombs in the countryside.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="21" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZjljZjM2MTAtODhhNy01MWFlLThmZWYtMGE0OTExZTU4ZWVm"><div id="f9cf3610-88a7-51ae-8fef-0a4911e58eef" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus#f9cf3610-88a7-51ae-8fef-0a4911e58eef"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon"><img alt="Adam Rasgon" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-12-08T13:53:23.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Dec. 8, 2024, 8:53 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Iran’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that decision-making about the future of Syria was “solely the responsibility” of Syrians and called for a national dialogue that includes all parts of Syrian society in order to form a new government.

Syria’s longtime leader left the country after holding talks with “several parties of the armed conflict,” according to Russia’s Foreign Ministry. It did not say where Mr. al-Assad might be.</p><p>Born Ahmed Hussein al-Shara in Saudi Arabia, Mr. al-Jolani is the child of Syrian exiles, according to Arab media reports. In the late 1980s, his family moved back to Syria, and in 2003, he went to neighboring Iraq to join Al Qaeda and fight the U.S. occupation.</p><p>He spent several years in a U.S. prison in Iraq, according to the Arab media reports and U.S. officials.</p><p>He later emerged in Syria around the start of the civil war and formed the Nusra Front, a Qaeda affiliate, which eventually evolved into Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. At some point, he took on the nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Jolani.</p><p>Since breaking ties with Al Qaeda, Mr. al-Jolani and his group have tried to <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/jawlanis-state-union" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gain international legitimacy</a> by eschewing global jihadist ambitions and focusing on organized governance in Syria.</p><p>In recent years, Mr. al-Jolani and his group have built an administration in the territory they govern, collecting taxes, providing limited public services, and even issuing identity cards to residents, according to a United Nations report. They have also come under criticism from inside and outside the country for using authoritarian tactics and cracking down on dissent.</p><p>Questions have emerged about what kind of government Mr. al-Jolani would support and whether Syrians would accept it. In Idlib, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has espoused a government guided by a conservative and at times hard-line Sunni Islamist ideology.</p><p>Since the rebel offensive began, Mr. al-Jolani has sought to reassure minority communities from other sects and religions. Some analysts said he now faces the test of his life: whether he can unite Syrians.</p><p>Mr. Drevon likened the situation facing Mr. al-Jolani to those of other leaders who have taken on greater prominence during war, like President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.</p><p>“In a way, this is his Zelensky moment,” Mr. Drevon said. “Zelensky was criticized before the war in Ukraine, and then he became a statesman. The question is can Jolani make the same transformation.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="16" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYWFhNDAzMjQtYWY5NC01YzE1LThiMjYtZTEzZWM4Y2FlZjEx"><div id="aaa40324-af94-5c15-8b26-e13ec8caef11" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus#aaa40324-af94-5c15-8b26-e13ec8caef11"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/vivian-yee"><img alt="Vivian Yee" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/multimedia/author-vivian-yee/author-vivian-yee-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/multimedia/author-vivian-yee/author-vivian-yee-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/multimedia/author-vivian-yee/author-vivian-yee-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-12-08T13:09:03.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Dec. 8, 2024, 8:09 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>In a statement, Egypt’s Foreign Ministry called on the parties in Syria’s conflict to start a “comprehensive political process” to establish peace.
