It marked a dramatic breakthrough for rebel factions in Syria that have been trying to unseat him for more than a decade, much of which was marked by a devastating civil war.</p><div><p>For many in Syria, Mr. al-Assad’s fall was a moment filled with hope as they no longer feared the regime that had used oppressive tactics to quash their freedoms. But it was also rife with uncertainty over who will rule Syria next and raised fears of a power vacuum in a country that has been rived with competing factions vying for control of different areas of territory.</p><p>“Our hearts are dancing with joy,” Walaa Salameh, 35, a resident of the Damascus area, said in a phone interview. “We can’t predict the future and anything is possible, but the most important thing is we got rid of this oppressive regime.”</p><p>The Russian Foreign Ministry’s statement did not offer details on Mr. al-Assad’s exact location, saying only that he had held talks with “several parties of the armed conflict.” There was no immediate comment from the Syrian presidency about Mr. al-Assad.</p><p>Earlier Sunday, the main rebel coalition, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-hts-who-what.html" title="">Hayat Tahrir al-Sham</a>, had announced on its Telegram channel that it had taken the capital, Damascus, and that Syrian forces were withdrawing. </p><p>State television went from trumpeting Mr. al-Assad’s strong defenses to broadcasting an announcement by a group of nine rebels on Sunday: “The city of Damascus has been liberated, the tyrant Bashar al-Assad has been toppled,” one of them read out, adding. “Long live a free and independent Syria for all Syrians of all sects.”</p><p>The events capped a startling two weeks in which the coalition of rebel groups that had been pinned down in a small corner of Syria’s northwest seized the country’s major cities, shattering a stalemate in Syria’s 13-year civil war.</p><p>“No one should shed any tears over the end of the Assad regime,” Daniel B. Shapiro, the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, said in Bahrain.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Who are the rebels?:</strong> After attracting little notice for years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-leader-interview.html" title="">Abu Mohammad al-Jolani</a> spearheaded the offensive that led to the fall of Mr. al-Assad’s regime. First, the rebels seized Syria’s largest city, Aleppo, then days later blazed through Hama and the strategic city of Homs, en route to the capital.</p></li><li><p><strong>Assad’s location:</strong> Amid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus#the-location-of-bashar-al-assad-remains-unclear" title="">swirling questions over Mr. al-Assad’s whereabouts</a>, Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali, Syria’s prime minister, said that he had not spoken with him since Saturday. Mr. al-Jalali said that he would stay in the country and was ready to work with whomever Syrians choose as their leader. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham said it would work with Mr. al-Jalali and called on Syrian military forces in Damascus to stay away from public institutions, which it said would remain under the prime minister’s supervision until they are formally handed over.</p></li><li><p><strong>Assad’s allies:</strong> Mr. al-Assad had kept rebel forces at bay for more than a decade with Iranian and Russian military support. But in recent days, Iran and Russia appeared to be turning to diplomacy to preserve their interests in the country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/07/world/syria-war-damascus#russia-an-assad-ally-is-unlikely-to-come-to-his-aid" title="">rather than significant military support</a>. The Foreign Ministry of Iran <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus/f9cf3610-88a7-51ae-8fef-0a4911e58eef?smid=url-share" title="">said decision-making</a> about the future of Syria was “solely the responsibility” of Syrians. Mr. al-Assad’s fall has <a href="#assads-fall-deprives-hezbollah-of-a-key-ally" title="">deprived</a> Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group and political party, of a key ally.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prisoners freed: </strong>As the rebels advanced, they took over many of the notorious prisons where the Assad regime has for decades imprisoned, tortured and executed political prisoners. Videos emerging from north of Damascus show groups of men walking through city streets at night, reportedly after being freed from Sednaya Prison, which the rebels have taken, according to war monitors and the fighters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Broader instability:</strong> Israel’s military said it had <a href="#israel-says-it-has-entered-the-demilitarized-buffer-zone-in-the-golan-heights" title="">entered a demilitarized buffer zone</a> in territory it controls in the Golan Heights, abutting Syria. The Israeli military, which is concerned about the sudden surge in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-damascus-iran.html" title="">instability near its borders,</a> said it was acting to protect Israeli civilians. Iraq has secured its border with Syria, according to the official Iraqi News Agency, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus/999e405d-4bf2-51f0-8672-2fd646a96a0c?smid=url-share" title="">said</a> on Sunday that the Al-Qaim border crossing was closed.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="66" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzU1YzIxZDdiLTcxNDAtNTMwNC05OTFkLWYyMGYyY2I2NzdiYg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus#syria-prisons-sednaya-assad" data-source-id="100000009865724"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matthew-mpoke-bigg"><img alt="Matthew Mpoke Bigg" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/01/reader-center/author-matthew-bigg/author-matthew-bigg-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/01/reader-center/author-matthew-bigg/author-matthew-bigg-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/01/reader-center/author-matthew-bigg/author-matthew-bigg-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-12-08T16:19:47.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Dec. 8, 2024, 11:19 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Inside a prison in Hama, Syria, on Saturday after rebels took control of the city.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kasim Rammah/Anadolu, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>For many Syrians, the fall of President Bashar al-Assad provides an opportunity — at last — to try to discover the fates of loved ones who disappeared into a notorious military prison that has become a symbol of human rights abuses under his rule.</p><p>The rebels who swept across Syria and claimed to have taken the capital, Damascus, appear to have also captured the prison complex of Sednaya, where human rights groups say Mr. al-Assad kept large numbers of political prisoners, according to reports and videos circulating on social media on Sunday.</p><div><p>For more than a decade, human rights groups and news organizations including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/world/middleeast/syria-torture-practices.html" title="">The New York Times have documented</a> the torture, sexual assault and mass execution of detainees in the government’s network of prisons, of which Sednaya, on the northern outskirts of Damascus, was the most notorious and feared.</p><p>For relatives and friends, the absence of information about those imprisoned has been agonizing, compounded by the knowledge that detainees may have been tortured or killed.</p><p>The rebels appear to have made the prisons a central focus of their campaign.</p><p>On Sunday, media outlets in the Arab world aired a video of a group of men who said they were broadcasting from a Syrian state television studio. The men, who said they represented rebel forces, announced “the liberation of the city of Damascus, the toppling of the dictator Bashar al-Assad, and the liberation of all oppressed prisoners from the regime’s jails.”</p><p>On social media, Syrians posted photos and identification numbers of loved ones who had been detained, hoping that someone might have spotted them finally free.</p><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/08/08visualUploader-40839-cover/08visualUploader-40839-cover-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>Videos emerging from north of Damascus showed groups of men walking through city streets at night, reportedly after being freed from Sednaya. The videos, from the town of Mneen, about three miles from the prison, were verified by The New York Times.</p><p>Ahmed al-Misilmani, a journalist in northwestern Syria, said that his first thought when he heard reports that rebels had captured the prison was of friends who had been held there.</p><p>“We hope to God they are still alive,” said Mr. al-Misilmani, who said he was displaced from his home near the city of Homs six years ago.</p><p>More than 130,000 people have been <a href="https://snhr.org/blog/2024/08/30/record-of-arbitrary-arrests1/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">subjected to arbitrary arrest and detention</a> by the government, according to a report in August by the Syrian Network for Human Rights, which began its count when the conflict began in 2011. It said that more than 15,000 people had <a href="https://snhr.org/blog/2024/08/30/death-toll-due-to-torture/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">died “due to torture”</a> by government forces between 2011 and July this year.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/reader-center/insider-syria-prisons.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">interview with The New York Times</a> in 2016, Mr. al-Assad said that anyone in prison in Syria had committed a crime, suggested that the family members of detainees were lying and insisted that the numbers of prisoners showed Syria’s justice system was working.</p><p>But a secret, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/world/middleeast/syria-torture-prisons.html" title="">industrial-scale system</a> of arbitrary arrests and torture prisons was central to Mr. al-Assad’s ability to crush a civilian uprising against his rule and then to overcome a rebellion, according to reports from human rights groups.</p><p>While the Syrian military, backed by Russia and Iran, fought armed rebels for territory, the government waged a war on civilians, throwing hundreds of thousands into filthy dungeons, according to reporting by The New York Times and human rights groups.</p><p>Many prisoners died in conditions so dire that a <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoISyria/A-HRC-31-CRP1_en.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">United Nations investigation</a> labeled the process “extermination.”</p><p>While the regime maintained an archipelago of jails, Sednaya was often the final destination for prisoners detained elsewhere, according to Amnesty International, which said that <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2016/08/syria-torture-prisons/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tens of thousands of people</a> across the country had died in custody since 2011.</p><p>Aric Toler<!-- --> and <!-- -->Nailah Morgan<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="65" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-RW1iZWRkZWRJbnRlcmFjdGl2ZTpueXQ6Ly9lbWJlZGRlZGludGVyYWN0aXZlLzAwNTczNGZkLTEzNmEtNTBlMi05NDZjLTg1MGE3MGUxY2VlOQ=="><div><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="syria-control-map-dec7-nzn8y" data-id="100000009865779" data-source-id="100000009865779"><div slug="syria-control-map-dec7-nzn8y" data-sourceid="100000009865779" id="embed-id-100000009865779">

He and the other members of the rescue team spent more than a decade responding to the aftermath of airstrikes by Syrian and Russian warplanes that were key to keeping President Bashar al-Assad in power.</p><p>Mr. Qutaneh, 30, a father of two, grew up in the northwest city of Khan Sheikhoun, which was hit by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/world/middleeast/syria-gas-attack.html" title="">chemical weapons</a> in 2017.</p><p>Warnings of airstrikes came in brief phrases or in one word: “The warplane has taken off.” “The warplane is flying overhead.” “Airstrike.”</p><p>Mr. Qutaneh’s own home in Khan Sheikhoun was destroyed in one of those strikes.</p><p>“You can’t imagine the joy today,” he said, adding that people for the first time were gathered in the streets in large crowds, no longer fearful that they could be targeted from the skies. “What happened is the beginning of the road to justice.”</p><p>More than 100,000 Syrians have been killed from airstrikes alone, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, a watchdog group.</p><p>“We are living a happiness that can’t be described,” Ramez Abu Farhan, 41, from the central city of Homs said after he returned home from celebrating in the city’s main square. “There is safety, there isn’t shelling; there aren’t airstrikes; there are no planes, and we are hopeful for the future.”</p><p>The city had not been hit with airstrikes for years after the Assad government regained control of it.

Syria’s longtime leader left the country after holding talks with “several parties of the armed conflict,” according to Russia’s Foreign Ministry. It did not say where Mr. al-Assad might be.</p><p>Born Ahmed Hussein al-Shara in Saudi Arabia, Mr. al-Jolani is the child of Syrian exiles, according to Arab media reports. In the late 1980s, his family moved back to Syria, and in 2003, he went to neighboring Iraq to join Al Qaeda and fight the U.S. occupation.</p><p>He spent several years in a U.S. prison in Iraq, according to the Arab media reports and U.S. officials.</p><p>He later emerged in Syria around the start of the civil war and formed the Nusra Front, a Qaeda affiliate, which eventually evolved into Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. At some point, he took on the nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Jolani.</p><p>Since breaking ties with Al Qaeda, Mr. al-Jolani and his group have tried to <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/jawlanis-state-union" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gain international legitimacy</a> by eschewing global jihadist ambitions and focusing on organized governance in Syria.</p><p>In recent years, Mr. al-Jolani and his group have built an administration in the territory they govern, collecting taxes, providing limited public services, and even issuing identity cards to residents, according to a United Nations report. They have also come under criticism from inside and outside the country for using authoritarian tactics and cracking down on dissent.</p><p>Questions have emerged about what kind of government Mr. al-Jolani would support and whether Syrians would accept it. In Idlib, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has espoused a government guided by a conservative and at times hard-line Sunni Islamist ideology.</p><p>Since the rebel offensive began, Mr. al-Jolani has sought to reassure minority communities from other sects and religions. Some analysts said he now faces the test of his life: whether he can unite Syrians.</p><p>Mr. Drevon likened the situation facing Mr. al-Jolani to those of other leaders who have taken on greater prominence during war, like President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.</p><p>“In a way, this is his Zelensky moment,” Mr. Drevon said. “Zelensky was criticized before the war in Ukraine, and then he became a statesman. The question is can Jolani make the same transformation.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="49" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYWFhNDAzMjQtYWY5NC01YzE1LThiMjYtZTEzZWM4Y2FlZjEx"><div id="aaa40324-af94-5c15-8b26-e13ec8caef11" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus#aaa40324-af94-5c15-8b26-e13ec8caef11"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/vivian-yee"><img alt="Vivian Yee" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/multimedia/author-vivian-yee/author-vivian-yee-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/multimedia/author-vivian-yee/author-vivian-yee-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/multimedia/author-vivian-yee/author-vivian-yee-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-12-08T13:09:03.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Dec. 8, 2024, 8:09 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>In a statement, Egypt’s Foreign Ministry called on the parties in Syria’s conflict to start a “comprehensive political process” to establish peace.

Everyone knew the consequences of dissent: disappearance into government prisons, from which few ever returned.</p><p>But as Saturday turned to Sunday — the first day in more than five decades that dawn broke without an al-Assad in the presidential palace — the streets were loud with joy.</p><div><p>Nonstop celebratory gunfire crackled around Damascus, the capital, like so many fireworks displays. Crowds shouted in the squares. Rebel fighters celebrated from atop their trucks.</p><p>“Our hearts are dancing with joy,” Walaa Salameh, 35, a resident of the Damascus area, said in a phone interview. “We can’t predict the future, and anything is possible, but the most important thing is we got rid of this oppressive regime.”</p><p>It had been 13 years since those opposed to President Bashar al-Assad first hoped to follow revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya by overthrowing their own autocratic leader: 13 years of bloodshed and death, of homes and loved ones lost, of lives abandoned and ruptured.</p><p>Mr. al-Assad’s opponents had to wait until Sunday. Years after most Syrians had given up on ever witnessing such moments at home, scenes familiar from past Arab Spring revolts were playing out, with unthinkable suddenness, in Damascus.</p><p>State television went from trumpeting Mr. al-Assad’s strong defenses on Saturday to broadcasting an announcement by a group of nine rebels on Sunday: “By the grace of God Almighty, the city of Damascus has been liberated, the tyrant Bashar al-Assad has been toppled, and all the unjustly detained people from the regime’s prisons have been released,” one of them read out. “Long live a free and independent Syria for all Syrians of all sects.”</p><p>News photographs showed a rebel sitting behind what appeared to be a vast, gleaming desk in an office in the presidential palace, all intricate inlaid wood and fine carpets. Others showed people wandering through Mr. al-Assad’s residence, pulling down a chandelier, picking through rooms they were never meant to see.</p><p>The embassy of Iran, one of Mr. al-Assad’s fiercest allies, was also ransacked, news photographs showed. Syrians tore down a poster that had hung there of Qassem Soleimani, a key Iranian commander who helped Mr. al-Assad push back the rebels earlier in the war.</p><p>A video from Damascus showed one of the military checkpoints that had proclaimed Mr. al-Assad’s power dark and empty, its soldiers’ uniforms in a heap on the ground.</p><p>“Thank God, thank God,” said Eman Ouad, whose husband was killed in the civil war. Her voice was close to breaking.</p><p>“Our freedom has returned,” said Ms. Ouad, 44, who was forced to leave her home in Damascus and now lives in Syria’s northwest. “Thirteen years of subjugation. Thirteen years of displacement.”</p><p>When he heard Mr. al-Assad was gone, Ahmed al-Misilmani, a journalist in northwest Syria, ran onto his balcony in sheer elation, yelling so loudly that his wife and children woke up.</p><p>“God is great, Assad the dog has fallen,” he shouted.</p><p>Yet no amount of euphoria, no wellspring of hope, could make Syrians forget all they had lost.</p><p>Mr. al-Misilmani’s mind went immediately to friends who had been imprisoned at Sednaya, a government prison infamous for torture and mass executions — just one part of a labyrinthine detention system where so many Syrians disappeared, most without a trace.</p><p>“We hope to God they are still alive,” said Mr. al-Misilmani, who was displaced six years ago from his home near the city of Homs.</p><p>Anas Khoury, 24, an opposition activist who fled his Damascus suburb with his wife after a 2013 chemical attack there, spent the first hours of his post-Assad life scanning lists of prisoners freed from Sednaya, he said. His brother was detained there in 2011. The family does not know if he is still alive.</p><p>Mr. Khoury was struggling to process it all. His children were born in Idlib Province, where the family fled, and had never met their grandparents. Until a few days ago, it would have been reasonable to predict that they never would.</p><p>“They were born in displacement,” he said. “They were born among the tents.”</p><p>In the hours after Mr. al-Assad disappeared from Syria, his image was disappearing, too.</p><p>Like his secret police, the president’s face was once <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/world/middleeast/syria-recovery-aleppo-douma.html" title="">impossible to escape</a>. Along Syrian roads and at the entrances to cities, banners featuring the president’s photo read, “Assad Forever.” His image watched from cigarette lighters hawked at Damascus souvenir stands, shoulder-to-shoulder with two of his most important backers, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the Hezbollah leader at the time, Hassan Nasrallah. Street corners and army checkpoints were festooned with Assads, as if his face were the national flag.</p><p>On Sunday, photos and videos circulating on social media showed people tearing his pictures down , setting them on fire and stomping on them, a small form of personal revenge.</p><p>Statues of the president’s father and elder brother fell with a crash in several cities, according to photos and videos: in Damascus; Latakia, the al-Assad stronghold on the Mediterranean coast; and Qamishli, in northeastern Syria.</p><p>One statue people had not succeeded in toppling was one of Mr. al-Assad’s father and predecessor, Hafez al-Assad, outside the Dar al-Assad Center for Culture and Arts in Damascus, a video live-streamed on Instagram showed.</p><p>Instead, they left it with a trash can upturned over its head.</p><p>“Now and God willing forever, he’s gone and all this fear inside me is gone,” said Talal Alasaad, 31, who fled the countryside near Aleppo for Lebanon as a young man and now lives in Switzerland. “We don’t have to fear him anymore, and we can scream it so loudly.”</p><p>He had not seen his elderly parents in more than 10 years, afraid he would be forced into military service if he returned. Now his mother was sending him videos she had taken of his childhood home, which had been commandeered early in the war by forces loyal to Mr. al-Assad. His parents had returned to see it after rebels retook Aleppo in a shock offensive on Nov. 30.</p><p>“It’s insane what is happening,” Mr. Alasaad said. “I’m full of emotion. I feel for once that I have a country, that I have a place I can return to. For the first time ever, I feel I have a home.”</p><p>The Syrian government’s fall could allow Mr. Alasaad and millions of other Syrian refugees around the world to return. Already on Sunday, people were lining up to enter Syria at a border crossing in Lebanon. Others were celebrating in Beirut, the Lebanese capital, where hundreds of thousands of Syrians fled over the course of the war.</p><p>In Turkey, which hosts more than three million Syrian refugees, photos showed crowds of revelers outside the Fatih Mosque in Istanbul waving the opposition’s three-starred flag.</p><p>Mr. al-Assad’s downfall was “a miracle,” said Muhammad al-Shammary, who fled the Damascus suburbs for Turkey in 2013. It had been more than a decade since he had seen most of his family members, including his siblings and in-laws. He hoped to return to Syria as soon as it was safe and feasible, he said.</p><p>Many Syrians had resigned themselves to lives in exile, said Mr. al-Shammary, 44.</p><p>“They engraved this inside our minds: that they would rule forever,” he said.</p><p>Now it was the al-Assads who were in exile, and Mr. al-Shammary could think of going home.</p><p>Aaron Boxerman<!-- -->, Adam Rasgon and <!-- -->Euan Ward<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
