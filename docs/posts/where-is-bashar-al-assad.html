It marked a dramatic breakthrough for rebel factions in Syria that have been trying to unseat Mr. al-Assad for more than a decade, much of which was marked by a devastating civil war.</p><div><p>For many in Syria, Mr. Assad’s fall was a moment filled with hope as they no longer feared the regime that has used oppressive tactics to quash their freedoms. But it was also rife with uncertainty over who will rule Syria next and raised fears of a power vacuum in a country that has been rived with competing factions vying for control of different areas of territory.</p><p>“Our hearts are dancing with joy,” Walaa Salameh, 35, a resident of the Damascus area, said in a phone interview. “We can’t predict the future and anything is possible, but the most important thing is we got rid of this oppressive regime.”</p><p>The Foreign Ministry’s statement did not offer details on Mr. al-Assad’s exact location, saying only that he had held talks with “several parties of the armed conflict.” There was no immediate comment from the Syrian presidency about Mr. al-Assad.</p><p>Earlier Sunday, the main rebel coalition, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-hts-who-what.html" title="">Hayat Tahrir al-Sham</a>, had announced on its Telegram channel that it had taken the capital, Damascus, and that Syrian forces were withdrawing. It later said that Mr. al-Assad had fallen and that Damascus was “free of the tyrant.”</p><p>The events capped a startling two weeks in which the coalition of rebel groups that had been pinned down in a small corner of Syria’s northwest swept through the country’s major cities, shattering a stalemate in Syria’s 13-year civil war.</p><p>As reports spread of Syrian government troops fleeing their posts and peeling off uniforms, the sounds of gunfire erupted in Damascus before dawn on Sunday, witnesses said. By late morning, the streets were largely empty but the sound of gunfire still echoed.</p><p>“No one should shed any tears over the end of the Assad regime,” Daniel B. Shapiro, the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, said in Bahrain.</p><p>Amid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus#the-location-of-bashar-al-assad-remains-unclear" title="">swirling questions over Mr. al-Assad’s whereabouts</a>, Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali, Syria’s prime minister, said that he had not spoken with him since Saturday. Mr. al-Jalali said that he would stay in the country and was ready to work with whomever Syrians choose as their leader.</p><p>Hayat Tahrir al-Sham said it would work with Mr. al-Jalali and called on Syrian military forces in Damascus to stay away from public institutions, which it said would remain under Mr. al-Jalali’s supervision until they are formally handed over.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Who are the rebels?:</strong> After attracting little notice for years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-leader-interview.html" title="">Abu Mohammad al-Jolani</a> spearheaded a stunning lightning offensive that led to the fall of Mr. al-Assad’s regime. First, the rebels seized Syria’s largest city, Aleppo, then days later blazed through Hama and the strategic city of Homs, en route to the capital.</p></li><li><p><strong>Damascus reacts:</strong> Three civilians in the capital told The New York Times that they heard gunfire in the city overnight. It was not immediately clear at the time who was firing. One resident said the gunfire appeared to be celebrating the rebels’ advance, and that some people were dancing in the streets. Amid the celebration, Syrians were <a href="#syria-damascus-eyewitness-assad" title="">also mourning</a> all they had lost over 13 years of civil war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Assad’s allies:</strong> Mr. al-Assad had kept rebel forces at bay for more than a decade with Iranian and Russian military support. But in recent days, Iran and Russia appeared to be turning to diplomacy to preserve their interests in the country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/07/world/syria-war-damascus#russia-an-assad-ally-is-unlikely-to-come-to-his-aid" title="">rather than significant military support</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prisoners freed: </strong>As the rebels advanced, they took over many of the notorious prisons where the Assad regime has for decades imprisoned, tortured and executed political prisoners. Videos emerging from north of Damascus show groups of men walking through city streets at night, reportedly after being freed from Sednaya Prison, which the rebels have taken, according to war monitors and the fighters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Refugees look homeward:</strong> Some Syrian refugees around the world have been glued to the news for updates on whether the Assad regime had fallen. Muhammad al-Shammary, who fled the Damascus suburbs for Turkey in 2013, said he hoped to return to the country as soon as it was safe and feasible to do so. He hasn’t seen most of his family members — including his siblings and in-laws — for over a decade. Many Syrian refugees had resigned themselves to a life in exile, said Mr. al-Shammary, 44. “They engraved this inside our minds: that they would rule forever,” he said.</p></li><li><p><strong>Broader instability:</strong> Israel’s military said it had entered a demilitarized buffer zone in territory it controls in the Golan Heights, abutting Syria. The Israeli military, which is concerned about the sudden surge in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-damascus-iran.html" title="">instability near its borders,</a> said it was acting to protect Israeli civilians. Iraq has secured its border with Syria, according to the official Iraqi News Agency, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus/999e405d-4bf2-51f0-8672-2fd646a96a0c?smid=url-share" title="">said</a> on Sunday that the Al-Qaim border crossing was closed.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="55" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZjljZjM2MTAtODhhNy01MWFlLThmZWYtMGE0OTExZTU4ZWVm"><div id="f9cf3610-88a7-51ae-8fef-0a4911e58eef" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus#f9cf3610-88a7-51ae-8fef-0a4911e58eef"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon"><img alt="Adam Rasgon" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-12-08T13:53:23.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Dec. 8, 2024, 8:53 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Iran’s foreign ministry said in a statement that decision-making about the future of Syria was “solely the responsibility” of Syrians and called for a national dialogue that includes all parts of Syrian society as a new government is formed.

Syria’s longtime leader had left the country after holding talks with “several parties of the armed conflict,” according to Russia’s Foreign Ministry. It did not say where Mr. al-Assad might be.</p><p>Born Ahmed Hussein al-Shara in Saudi Arabia, Mr. al-Jolani is the child of Syrian exiles, according to Arab media reports. In the late 1980s, his family moved back to Syria, and in 2003, he went to neighboring Iraq to join Al Qaeda and fight the U.S. occupation.</p><p>He spent several years in a U.S. prison in Iraq, according to the Arab media reports and U.S. officials.</p><p>He later emerged in Syria around the start of the civil war and formed the Nusra Front, an Al Qaeda affiliate, which eventually evolved into Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. At some point, he took on the nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Jolani.</p><p>Since breaking ties with Al Qaeda, Mr. al-Jolani and his group have tried to <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/jawlanis-state-union" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gain international legitimacy</a> by eschewing global jihadist ambitions and focusing on organized governance in Syria.</p><p>In recent years, Mr. al-Jolani and his group have built an administration in the territory they govern, collecting taxes, providing limited public services, and even issuing identity cards to residents, according to a U.N. report. They have also come under criticism from inside and outside the country for using authoritarian tactics and cracking down on dissent.</p><p>Questions have emerged about what kind of government Mr. al-Jolani would support and whether Syrians would accept it. In Idlib, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has espoused a government guided by a conservative and at times hard-line Sunni Islamist ideology.</p><p>Since the rebel offensive began, Mr. al-Jolani has sought to reassure minority communities from other sects and religions. Some analysts said he now faces the test of his life: whether he can unite Syrians.</p><p>Mr. Drevon likened the situation facing Mr. al-Jolani to those of other leaders who have taken on greater prominence during war, like President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.</p><p>“In a way, this is his Zelensky moment,” Mr. Drevon said. “Zelensky was criticized before the war in Ukraine and then he became a statesman. The question is can Jolani make the same transformation.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="49" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYWFhNDAzMjQtYWY5NC01YzE1LThiMjYtZTEzZWM4Y2FlZjEx"><div id="aaa40324-af94-5c15-8b26-e13ec8caef11" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus#aaa40324-af94-5c15-8b26-e13ec8caef11"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/vivian-yee"><img alt="Vivian Yee" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/multimedia/author-vivian-yee/author-vivian-yee-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/multimedia/author-vivian-yee/author-vivian-yee-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/multimedia/author-vivian-yee/author-vivian-yee-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-12-08T13:09:03.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Dec. 8, 2024, 8:09 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>In a statement, Egypt’s foreign ministry called on the parties in Syria’s conflict to start a “comprehensive political process” to establish peace.
