Judge Adam B. Abelson of the District of Maryland had written in the lower court ruling last month that the orders sought to punish people for constitutionally protected speech.</p><p>On Friday, the three-judge panel of the <a href="https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals</a>, in Richmond, Va., found that the Trump administration had “satisfied the factors for a stay” of that order, writing that the orders “are of distinctly limited scope” and “do not purport to establish the illegality of all efforts to advance diversity, equity or inclusion.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Chief Judge Albert Diaz, who was appointed to the Fourth Circuit by President Barack Obama in 2010, wrote that ruling in the Trump administration’s favor was warranted but pushed back against the attacks on diversity initiatives, saying that “people of good faith who work to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion deserve praise, not opprobrium.”</p><p>“When this country embraces true diversity, it acknowledges and respects the social identity of its people,” <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca4.177868/gov.uscourts.ca4.177868.29.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote Judge Diaz</a>, who became the first Hispanic jurist to <a href="https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/news-announcements/latest-news-announcements/2023/07/10/baton-passing-brings-new-chief-judge-to-the-fourth-circuit-court-of-appeals" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">serve as chief judge of the court in 2023</a>. “When it fosters true equity, it opens opportunities and ensures a level playing field for all.
