    <h1>Appeals Court Allows Trump Administration’s DEI Crackdown to Proceed, but Judges Debate DEI Merits</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Chief Judge Albert Diaz, who was appointed to the Fourth Circuit by President Barack Obama in 2010, wrote that ruling in the Trump administration’s favor was warranted but pushed back against the attacks on diversity initiatives, saying that “people of good faith who work to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion deserve praise, not opprobrium.”</p><p>“When this country embraces true diversity, it acknowledges and respects the social identity of its people,” <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca4.177868/gov.uscourts.ca4.177868.29.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote Judge Diaz</a>, who became the first Hispanic jurist to <a href="https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/news-announcements/latest-news-announcements/2023/07/10/baton-passing-brings-new-chief-judge-to-the-fourth-circuit-court-of-appeals" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">serve as chief judge of the court in 2023</a>. “When it fosters true equity, it opens opportunities and ensures a level playing field for all. And when its policies are truly inclusive, it creates an environment and culture where everyone is respected and valued.”</p><p>He continued, “What could be more American than that?”</p><p>Judge Pamela Harris, writing in her own concurring opinion, said that she shared Judge Diaz’s sentiment.</p><p>“My vote should not be understood as agreement with the orders’ attack on efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion,” wrote Judge Harris, who was also appointed to the court by Mr. Obama.</p><p>But Judge Allison Jones Rushing, who was appointed by Mr. Trump during his first term, used her own concurring opinion to criticize Judge Diaz’s declaration of support for diversity, equity and inclusion.</p></div></div>
