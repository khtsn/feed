The settlement, which experts said was the highest single payout by an archdiocese, brings Los Angeles’s cumulative payout in sex abuse lawsuits to more than $1.5 billion.</p><p>The settlement was announced on Wednesday in a joint statement by lawyers for the plaintiffs and the archdiocese. </p><p>“I am sorry for every one of these incidents, from the bottom of my heart,” Archbishop José H. Gomez said in a statement. “My hope is that this settlement will provide some measure of healing for what these men and women have suffered.”</p><p>The agreement represents the near conclusion to decades of litigation against the archdiocese, with only a few suits remaining. In 2007, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/16/us/16cnd-abuse.html" title="">reached a $660 million settlement</a> in abuse lawsuits brought by 508 people who accused Catholic clergy and members of religious orders of abuse. Over the years, the archdiocese has sold off real estate, liquidated investments and taken out loans to cover the staggering costs of litigation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Archbishop Gomez said in a statement that the new settlement would be paid through “reserves, investments and loans, along with other archdiocesan assets and payments that will be made by religious orders and others named in the litigation.” He said that donations designated for parishes, schools and specific mission campaigns would not be used for the settlement.</p><p>“It’s never going to be full justice when the harm is a child’s life,” said Michael Reck, a lawyer with Jeff Anderson &amp; Associates who helped represent some of the plaintiffs. “But it’s a measure of justice and a measure of accountability that gives these survivors some sense of closure at least.”</p><p><em>This is a developing story.
