And still, it is graduation season on American campuses, where thousands of young adults will soon don four-sided caps and celebrate years of hard work while “Pomp and Circumstance” plays on repeat.</p><p>Like always, college administrators have selected a range of keynote speakers to impart wisdom (and, they hope, avoid controversy) at commencement ceremonies.</p><p>A year after pro-Palestinian protesters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/12/us/college-campus-protests" title="">demonstrated at</a> many graduations, and amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on higher education, colleges are walking a tightrope in picking speakers. Administrators want to find someone who is interesting and accomplished and perhaps has ties to their school, but also who is unlikely to set off protests or say something that would bring unwelcome attention.</p><p>This year’s list includes many of the usual suspects: governors, cabinet secretaries and political commentators with well-known views on the most divisive issues of the day. It also includes scores of athletes and celebrities from outside the partisan fray.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here is a look at some of the others, including a Muppet, who are scheduled to address graduates in the days and weeks ahead:</p><h2 id="link-a785487">The Entertainers</h2><p>Nothing seems likelier to boost graduation attendance than having a celebrity onstage to shake hands with graduates. This year, plenty have signed up.</p><p>The rapper <strong>Snoop Dogg</strong> will speak to graduates of the University of Southern California’s business school, and <strong>Jon M. Chu</strong>, a film director, will speak at that institution’s universitywide commencement. <strong>Steve Carell</strong> of “The Office” will be at Northwestern University, and <strong>Sandra Oh</strong> of “Grey’s Anatomy” will headline Dartmouth College’s ceremony. <strong>Elizabeth Banks</strong> of “The Hunger Games” will speak at the University of Pennsylvania. The singer <strong>Usher </strong>will be honored at Emory University’s graduation.</p><p>Vanderbilt University invited <strong>Gary Sinise</strong>, whose credits include “Forrest Gump” and “Apollo 13.” The singer <strong>Sara Bareilles</strong> will speak at the University of California, Los Angeles, and <strong>Taylor Sheridan</strong>, the creator of “Yellowstone,” will take the stage at the University of Texas at Austin. <strong>LeVar Burton</strong>, of “Reading Rainbow” fame, will speak at Howard University.</p><p>Perhaps no celebrity speaker will be more anticipated, or more unusual, than the amphibious orator at the University of Maryland: <strong>Kermit the Frog</strong>, who will have to forgive his hosts for not having green among their school colors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><h2 id="link-286aa1ee">The Politicians</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump will speak to students at the University of Alabama commencement in May.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At a time of intense political division and sharp critiques of higher education from many Republicans, colleges have signed up a bipartisan contingent of government leaders to speak.</p><p><strong>President Trump</strong> has said he will take the stage at the University of Alabama and the U.S. Military Academy. At least two members of his cabinet are also planning to address students. Homeland Security Secretary <strong>Kristi Noem</strong> is set to speak at Dakota State University, and <strong>Doug Collins</strong>, the veterans affairs secretary, will visit Piedmont University in his home state of Georgia.</p><p>Plenty of governors are also preparing speeches. Among Republicans, <strong>Kelly Ayotte</strong> of New Hampshire will address Nashua Community College graduates, <strong>Phil Scott</strong> of Vermont will be welcomed to Norwich University and <strong>Glenn Youngkin</strong> of Virginia will speak twice in two days, first at Liberty University and then at the University of Virginia’s College at Wise. <strong>Charlie Baker</strong>, the former governor of Massachusetts and current leader of the N.C.A.A., will talk to graduates of Colby College.</p><p>Democratic governors will also take the stage, including <strong>Maura Healey </strong>of Massachusetts at Mount Holyoke College, <strong>Ned Lamont </strong>of Connecticut at Trinity College, <strong>Wes Moore</strong> of Maryland at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, <strong>JB Pritzker</strong> of Illinois at Knox College and <strong>Tim Walz</strong> of Minnesota at the University of Minnesota’s law school. <strong>Steve Bullock</strong>, the former governor of Montana, will speak at Columbia Law School.</p><p>Some international leaders are also expected. <strong>Jacinda Ardern</strong>, the former prime minister of New Zealand, will be at Yale University’s Class Day, and <strong>Mary McAleese</strong>, the former president of Ireland, has been invited to St. Mary’s College in Indiana.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-36ebd16f">The Athletes</h2><p>Many universities opted for sports stars this year. <strong>Derek Jeter</strong>, the longtime New York Yankees shortstop, will speak at the University of Michigan, and <strong>Orel Hershiser</strong>, the former Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher, will talk to graduates of Bowling Green State University, the school he attended.</p><p>Decorated Olympians are also on the speaker list. The gymnast <strong>Simone Biles</strong> will address graduates at Washington University in St. Louis and the swimmer <strong>Katie Ledecky</strong> at Stanford University will do the same. <strong>Mia Hamm</strong>, who won three Olympic medals on the U.S. women’s soccer team, will talk at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. <strong>Emma Coburn</strong>, a medal-winning track and field athlete, will give the address at the University of Colorado Boulder, where she competed as a collegian. <strong>Justin Best</strong>, a gold medalist in rowing, will speak at his alma mater, Drexel University.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Katie Ledecky, the swimmer, at the Olympics last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">James Hill for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>From the basketball world, <strong>Carmelo Anthony</strong> will return to Syracuse University, where he won a national championship. <strong>Grant Hill</strong>, whose pass set up the shot that delivered Duke University an Elite Eight win in 1992, will be back in Durham. And <strong>Jonquel Jones </strong>of the New York Liberty will speak at George Washington University.</p><p>Perhaps no sport is better represented on the graduation stage than football. Among the current and former players invited to speak: <strong>A.J. Brown</strong> at the University of Mississippi, <strong>Derwin James Jr.</strong> at the University of Bridgeport, <strong>Miles Killebrew</strong> at Southern Utah University and <strong>Larry Fitzgerald Jr.</strong> at the University of Pittsburgh.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-3010f907">The Media</h2><p>Journalists, sportscasters and television hosts will be well-represented on graduation stages, including <strong>Holly Rowe </strong>of ESPN at the University of Utah, <strong>Al Roker</strong> of NBC’s “Today” at Siena College and <strong>Steve Kornacki </strong>of NBC News at Marist University.</p><p><strong>Jason Gay</strong>, a Wall Street Journal sports columnist, will speak at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and <strong>Jay Shetty</strong>, an author and podcast host, will give remarks at Princeton University’s Class Day. <strong>Jonathan Karl</strong> of ABC News is set to be onstage at Washington College’s commencement, while <strong>Scott Pelley </strong>of CBS will talk to graduates of Wake Forest University.</p><h2 id="link-1a7597c8">The Faithful</h2><p>Many religious universities selected faith leaders to speak at their ceremonies.</p><p><strong>Bobby Gruenewald</strong>, a Christian pastor and the founder of the popular YouVersion Bible App, will address graduates of Oral Roberts University. At Brigham Young University, <strong>Clark Gilbert</strong>, a leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, gave the keynote address this week. <strong>Bishop Robert Barron</strong> will speak at the Catholic University of America, and <strong>the Rev. Ricky Jenkins</strong>, who leads a church in California, will address graduates of Wheaton College in Illinois.</p><p>Benedictine College, a Catholic institution in Kansas, chose <strong>Sister Deirdre Byrne</strong>, who is a surgeon and a retired Army colonel, as its commencement speaker.</p><h2 id="link-171d9b8">The Executives</h2><p>Several universities opted to have a business leader talk to graduates, including Virginia Commonwealth University, which invited <strong>Everette Taylor</strong>, the chief executive of Kickstarter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Everette Taylor, center, the chief executive of Kickstarter, will speak at Virginia Commonwealth University.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jutharat Pinyodoonyachet for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><strong>Melonie D.

Bolden Jr.</strong>, a former astronaut and NASA administrator, will be onstage at Ohio State University. <strong>Alan M. Dershowitz</strong>, a legal scholar who represented Mr. Trump in an impeachment trial, will speak at the New College of Florida.</p><p><strong>Angela Duckworth</strong>, a psychology professor and author, will speak at Bates College. The California Institute of Technology selected <strong>Walter Massey</strong>, a physicist. And the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign stayed close to home, choosing its chancellor, <strong>Robert J. Jones</strong>, to speak to graduates.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mitch Smith is a Chicago-based national correspondent for The Times, covering the Midwest and Great Plains.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>23</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Governors, Actors, a Talking Frog<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Seabed Mining:</strong> China’s foreign ministry said that an executive order President Trump signed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/china-trump-seabed-mining-international-law.html">accelerate the permitting process for seabed mining in international waters</a> “violates international law and harms the overall interests of the international community.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/climate/seafloor-mining-science.html">Here’s what to know</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Safety Net Programs: </strong>A draft document of a proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year outlines <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/trump-budget-cuts.html">steep cuts or the elimination of funding</a> for programs that provide child care, housing assistance, foreign aid and health research.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Prosecutor Queries Leading Medical Journal:</strong> The New England Journal of Medicine, considered the world’s most prestigious medical journal, received a letter suggesting that it was biased and compromised by external pressure. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/health/nejm-prosecutor-letter.html">Other journals have also received the letter</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>F.D.A.
