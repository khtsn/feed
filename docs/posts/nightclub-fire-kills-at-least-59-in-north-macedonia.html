The blaze — the deadliest national tragedy in recent memory — has horrified the small country in southeastern Europe.</p><p>“The loss of so many young lives is irreparable, and the pain of the families, loved ones and friends is immeasurable,” Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski <a href="https://x.com/MickoskiHM/status/1901187332843110592" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>.</p><p>The police have detained 15 people, including the manager of the club and the son of its owner, Mr. Toshkovski, the interior minister, said. He said that the company that ran the club did not have a license. He added that several former or current officials had been arrested in connection with the case.</p><p>“This license — as many other things in the past in Macedonia — is connected to bribery and corruption,” he said. “But I want to tell the Macedonian public that, unlike other times in the past, the people that issue these illegal licenses will be named and be held responsible for it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Toshkovski <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/3743717012585148/?mibextid=wwXIfr&amp;share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2Fr%2F199WVcQXMy%2F%3Fmibextid%3DwwXIfr&amp;rdid=HUPE1e6KC6DkPlDV" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that about 500 people had been inside the club but that only 250 tickets had been sold by the club in Kocani, which is about 50 miles east of the capital, Skopje. The blaze ripped through the club in the eastern town of Kocani during a pop concert, he said, adding that fireworks caused the roof to catch fire.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="kocani-nightclub-fire-map" data-id="100000010055094" data-source-id="100000010055094"><div slug="kocani-nightclub-fire-map" data-sourceid="100000010055094" id="embed-id-100000010055094">
