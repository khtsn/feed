The blaze — the deadliest national tragedy in recent memory — has horrified the small country in southeastern Europe.</p><p>“The loss of so many young lives is irreparable, and the pain of the families, loved ones and friends is immeasurable,” Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski <a href="https://x.com/MickoskiHM/status/1901187332843110592" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>.</p><p>The police have detained 15 people, including the manager of the club and the son of its owner, Mr. Toshkovski, the interior minister, said. He said that the company that ran the club did not have a license. He added that several former or current officials had been arrested in connection with the case.</p><p>“This license — as many other things in the past in Macedonia — is connected to bribery and corruption,” he said. “But I want to tell the Macedonian public that, unlike other times in the past, the people that issue these illegal licenses will be named and be held responsible for it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Toshkovski <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/3743717012585148/?mibextid=wwXIfr&amp;share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2Fr%2F199WVcQXMy%2F%3Fmibextid%3DwwXIfr&amp;rdid=HUPE1e6KC6DkPlDV" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that about 500 people had been inside the club but that only 250 tickets had been sold by the club in Kocani, which is about 50 miles east of the capital, Skopje. The blaze ripped through the club in the eastern town of Kocani during a pop concert, he said, adding that fireworks caused the roof to catch fire.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A police officer died while on duty in the club to check for drugs or underage guests, he said.</p><p>Patients being treated for injuries were between the ages of 16 and 24, Dr. Kristina Serafimova, the director of a hospital in Kocani, <a href="https://mia.mk/story/%D0%B4%D1%80.-%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BC-%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB-%D0%BE%D0%B4-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5-%D0%B2%D0%BE-%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0-%D0%B2%D0%BE-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%BE-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told reporters</a>. Many people died in a stampede, she said, as panicked people tried to escape the blaze.</p><p>“It’s devastating,” Goran Georgijev, 47, who lives a short walk from the club, said in a phone interview. He said his neighbor’s daughter, who was 17, died in the fire, as did the sons of two of his friends. They were 21 and 22, he said.</p><p>“I can’t even pick up the phone to call them,” Mr. Georgijev said of his friends and neighbors. “I don’t know what to say to them.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Georgijev used to go to the nightclub when he was younger, he said, adding that it was poorly built and had a cloth-covered ceiling. He said he heard a cracking sound around 3 a.m., and then the scream of sirens.</p><p>“I knew something terrible was happening,” he said, adding, “It is a tragic day for all of us.”</p><p>The death toll may still rise. Arben Taravari, the health minister, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/16DcEau1qa/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told reporters</a> that 20 people were in critical condition, and some patients were being sent to hospitals in other countries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/16/multimedia/16int-northmacedonia-fire-qfpl/16int-northmacedonia-fire-qfpl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/16/multimedia/16int-northmacedonia-fire-qfpl/16int-northmacedonia-fire-qfpl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/16/multimedia/16int-northmacedonia-fire-qfpl/16int-northmacedonia-fire-qfpl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Grieving people can be seen in a room in a hospital." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/16/multimedia/16int-northmacedonia-fire-qfpl/16int-northmacedonia-fire-qfpl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/16/multimedia/16int-northmacedonia-fire-qfpl/16int-northmacedonia-fire-qfpl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/16/multimedia/16int-northmacedonia-fire-qfpl/16int-northmacedonia-fire-qfpl-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 683w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/16/multimedia/16int-northmacedonia-fire-qfpl/16int-northmacedonia-fire-qfpl-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1366w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/f4277ff7-4b9f-5cee-a9da-e3d16499281c" decoding="async" width="600" height="900"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Relatives and survivors comforted one another on Sunday outside a hospital in Kocani.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Visar Kryeziu/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>And for many in North Macedonia, a small country of about two million people that borders Albania, Greece, Bulgaria, Kosovo and Serbia, the blaze brought up painful memories of other tragedies.</p><p>In 2021, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/09/world/europe/north-macedonia-hospital-covid-fire.html" title="">fire at a hospital for coronavirus patients</a> killed at least 14 people.
