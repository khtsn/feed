After last year’s host, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/08/movies/golden-globes-best-worst.html" title="">Jo Koy</a>, memorably bombed, the emcee this year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/arts/television/nikki-glaser-golden-globes-host.html" title="">Nikki Glaser</a>, could hardly do worse. But she wasn’t content to merely do better. After workshopping her opening monologue in dozens of club appearances over the holidays, she killed when it counted, cracking up the stars on hand at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, Calif., and winning over viewers on social media. The rest of the night went more or less smoothly, with a mix of expected and surprise winners. But it wouldn’t be an awards ceremony if there weren’t some truly off-kilter moments. Here are the highs and lows as we saw them.</p><h2 id="link-a0b7ac4">Best Host: Nikki Glaser</h2><p>When Glaser began putting together her Golden Globes monologue in early December, she told her writing staff, “Don’t be scared to be weird.”</p><p>You saw evidence of this in her stellar monologue on Sunday, which included the kind of hard punchlines she is known for, including a good insult of Paramount+ and a joke about the effect of Sean Combs’s arrest on the after-party. But there was also an impression of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/entertainmenttonight/reel/DEd4bmHsspK/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Adam Sandler pronouncing Timothée Chalamet’s name</a> that was just pure silliness — Sandler even joined in. Glaser doesn’t usually do impressions, but she committed and it went over really well, adding to the celebratory, fun tone to kick the night off.</p><p>If there was a joke that crushed in every test run, it was probably when she mentioned a few nominees: “‘Wicked,’ ‘Queer,’ ‘Nightbitch,’” then added “Not just things Ben Affleck yells after sex.” On Sunday, it killed again. <em>— Jason Zinoman</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><em>Read more on </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/05/movies/nikki-glaser-golden-globes-monologue.html" title=""><em>Nikki Glaser</em></a><em> and her </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/arts/television/nikki-glaser-golden-globes-host.html" title=""><em>preparation for the show</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 id="link-4cc7f57e">Best Costume Changes: Also Nikki Glaser</h2></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-3"><div><div><picture id="grid-image-0-" data-credit="Phillip Faraone/Getty Images For Moã«T &amp; Chandon"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/06/multimedia/06globes-best-worst-mvck/06globes-best-worst-mvck-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/06/multimedia/06globes-best-worst-mvck/06globes-best-worst-mvck-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-1-" data-credit="Rich Polk/Penske Media via Getty Images"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/06/arts/06globes-best-worst-hcjn/06globes-best-worst-hcjn-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/06/arts/06globes-best-worst-hcjn/06globes-best-worst-hcjn-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-2-" data-credit="Rich Polk/Penske Media via Getty Images"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/06/arts/06globes-best-worst-hcjg/06globes-best-worst-hcjg-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/06/arts/06globes-best-worst-hcjg/06globes-best-worst-hcjg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture></div><figcaption><span>Glaser&#39;s many wardrobe choices included a ball gown on the red carpet and wine and black outfits onstage.</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Glaser’s night started on the red carpet with a billowing strapless gold ball gown. For her first onstage appearance, she changed into a sequined silver sleeveless gown. By 8:30, she was on her third dress of the night. An hour into the ceremony, she was on Dress No. 5 (a sequined pink sleeveless stunner). By the end of the night, she had donned what seemed like 47 more. All that was missing? We’d have loved to see a dupe of Demi Moore’s viral <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/arts/design/wicked-the-substance-the-room-next-door.html" title="">yellow “Substance” coat</a>. <em>— Sarah Bahr</em></p><h2 id="link-3d1db47f">Most Refreshing Development: Unexpected Winners</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fernanda Torres with her award for “I’m Still Here.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Robyn Beck/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Thus far, it’s been an excitingly unpredictable awards season, and though the Globes certainly gave a lot of hardware to already-strong contenders like “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/movies/emilia-perez-review.html" title="">Emilia Pérez</a>” and “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/movies/the-brutalist-review.html" title="">The Brutalist,</a>” it still feels like a wide open field. In the acting races, unexpected wins for the likes of Demi Moore, Fernanda Torres and Sebastian Stan produced some of the most heartfelt speeches of the night and made already competitive Oscar categories even harder to predict. And a total shutout of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/movies/anora-review.html" title="">Anora</a>,” which went into Sunday flying high, means that little is decided this season, a fun development after several years in which the ultimate Oscar winners seemed a foregone conclusion long before the Globes weighed in. <em>— Kyle Buchanan</em></p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p><h2 id="link-7d5d1081">Least Refreshing Development: Retro Red-Carpet Looks</h2></p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-9"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nicole Kidman in Balenciaga.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amy Sussman/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Selena Gomez wore Prada.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amy Sussman/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Given that Hollywood awards shows celebrate the art of playing a role, perhaps it shouldn’t have been a big surprise that the dominant trend of the 2025 Globes red carpet was … retro role-playing. Ariana Grande did her best Audrey Hepburn impression in 1966 Givenchy couture; Selena Gomez channeled Jackie Kennedy in ice-blue Prada and a stylized bob; and Nicole Kidman and Margaret Qualley sported enormous <a href="https://www.newwavefilm.com/french-new-wave-encyclopedia/catherine-deneuve.shtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Catherine Deneuve</a> bouffants — all in a sea of mostly traditional tuxedos.</p><p>You can call it a return to classicism, or a retreat to the past, or the legacy of Joan Rivers, who instilled the fear of mockery in celebrities everywhere. But by the time Elle Fanning and Monica Barbaro had arrived in their newfangled Balmain and Dior versions of oldfangled 1950s ball gowns, it was hard not to wish that the stylists and designers working behind the scenes would start facing forward rather than back, and convince their clients to take a few more (unscripted) risks. <em>— Vanessa Friedman</em></p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/style/golden-globes-worst-fashion.html" title=""><em>Read more about the red carpet looks.</em></a></p><h2 id="link-16a3fb6a">Most Rousing Speech: Demi Moore</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demi Moore accepting the Globe as Andrew Garfield and Kerry Washington look on.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sonja Flemming/CBS</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>While the Globes have no direct bearing on Oscar nominations, academy members are surely paying attention, and Demi Moore, who won for “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/movies/the-substance-review.html" title="">The Substance</a>,” may have landed herself a spot in the best actress category with her rousing speech. Both poignant and relatable, Moore spoke movingly about her career struggles over more than 30 years, including being told she was a “popcorn actress.” She added that she had received the “bonkers” script for “The Substance” when she was at a low point in her career, thinking she was done.</p><p>But at 62, Moore has had a reversal of fortune and the stars in the room cheered her on, some even giving her a standing ovation. Thinking of “those moments when we don’t think we’re smart enough, or pretty enough, or skinny enough, or successful enough, or basically just not enough,” Moore said, a woman told her, “Just put down the measuring stick.” <em>— Nicole Sperling</em></p><h2 id="link-6363d813">Most Sincere Speech: Tadanobu Asano</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tadanobu Asano introducing himself to Golden Globes viewers.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sonja Flemming/CBS</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Many Golden Globe nominees have been to the Beverly Hilton before.

That made Tadanobu Asano’s acceptance speech for “Shogun” stand out. It was his first win, on his first nomination, and it showed. “Maybe you don’t know me,” he began. “I’m an actor from Japan. My name is Tadanobu Asano. Wow!” His peers stood and cheered him on. And as he grinned and clutched his award, he added: “This is a very big present for me!” He sure seemed like he meant it. <em>— Matt Stevens</em></p><h2 id="link-16fae602">Weirdest Honor: Box Office Achievement</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The “Wicked” team, led by Jon M.

But it also must have made $150 million worldwide, with at least $100 million domestically, which is pretty much the dictionary definition of a blockbuster. (“Wicked” finished 2024 with well over $680 million worldwide.)</p><p>This is a weird award to give out, and its presenter Vin Diesel made it even weirder by contrasting, in his preamble, his own “Fast and Furious” series and the work of Steven Spielberg (who invented the summer blockbuster with “Jaws” in 1975). But it’s also just a tad participation trophy-ish to hand out a golden statue to celebrate a movie making bank at the box office, no matter how fun the movie is.
