They are also used to apply “extreme coercion” to manipulate young people into harming or abusing themselves, their siblings or pets, the agency said.</p><p>“Members of ‘Com’ networks are usually young men who are motivated by status, power, control, misogyny, sexual gratification, or an obsession with extreme or violent material,” said the report, which added that the emergence of these types of online groups “are almost certainly causing some individuals, especially younger people, to develop a dangerous propensity for extreme violence.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It added that the networks typically attract young males promoting nihilistic views, who “attempt to gain status with other users by committing or encouraging harmful acts across a broad spectrum of offending.”</p><p>Users in Britain and other western countries “had exchanged millions of messages online relating to sexual and physical abuse,” it noted.</p><p>The crime agency gave the example of Cameron Finnigan, a British teenager who was sentenced to jail in January after being part of an online Satanist group that blackmails other children into filming or livestreaming self-harm, violence and sexual abuse. Mr. Finnigan, 19, used the Telegram app to encourage contacts to commit murder and suicide.</p><p>In his statement, Mr. Biggar said that police were collaborating with technology companies and psychologists to better understand the behavior of young people but added that he encouraged parents “to have regular conversations with their child about what they do online.”</p><p>Jess Phillips, a government minister who has responsibility for tackling violence against women and girls, described the scale of abuse outlined in the report as “absolutely horrific,” and also urged open conversations within families.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“My message to tech companies is simple: This is your responsibility, too,” she added. “You must ensure your platforms are safe for children, so that we can protect the most vulnerable and put predators behind bars.”</p><p>The agency’s latest survey focused heavily on the use of technology and online platforms in crimes including fraud, extremism and sexual abuse.</p><p>Citing statistics from the Internet Watch Foundation, a nonprofit organization, it said that 291,273 web pages had contained indecent images of children in 2024, a 6 percent increase since 2023. Of these, 91 percent were classified as self-generated indecent imagery, either shared consensually, or elicited through manipulation.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stephen Castle is a London correspondent of The Times, writing widely about Britain, its politics and the country’s relationship with Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/stephen-castle">More about Stephen Castle</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
