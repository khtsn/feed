Even those who had initially professed support for Mr. Trump’s trade plans are becoming increasingly worried about the consequences.</p><p>Even before Mr. Trump’s tariff announcement last week, the U.S. economy had been showing signs of strain after years of healthy performance, Mr. Dimon wrote. Inflation was already a worry, Mr. Dimon said, pointing to a yawning fiscal deficit and the need for more infrastructure spending. And stock valuations remain well above historical averages, — even after the recent market sell-off.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The potential consequences of the trade fight could make things worse, the letter said. Those include other countries’ efforts to fight back — as China has done by imposing 34 percent counter-levies — and a possible erosion of confidence among consumers and investors. Mr. Dimon also warned about the weakening of the American dollar’s role as the global reserve currency.</p><p>“If America, for whatever reason, becomes a less-attractive investment destination, the U.S. dollar and the economy could suffer if foreigners sold their U.S. assets,” he wrote.</p><p>JPMorgan’s own economists have increasingly been saying that a recession is more likely this year, though Mr. Dimon did not personally take a position on those odds in his shareholder letter.</p><p>While Mr. Dimon asserted that JPMorgan itself was strong enough to withstand the shocks that the levies posed — its traders have profited from previous whipsaws in the markets — the global economy may not be so fortunate. “It is not particularly good for the capital markets,” Mr. Dimon wrote of the tariff-linked volatility.</p><p>For now, Mr. Dimon wrote that he was hoping for a speedy resolution to the trade battles. “The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,” he wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The longer-term worry, Mr. Dimon said, is that Mr. Trump’s fight could shred decades-old alliances that cemented the United States’ primacy in the global order. The JPMorgan chief wrote that he was worried that America’s trading partners might seek out deals with the likes of China, Iran or Russia in response to the tariffs.</p><p>“America First is fine,” Mr. Dimon wrote, referring to Mr. Trump’s description of his policies — “as long as it doesn’t end up being America alone.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Trump vs. the World:</strong> Times journalists Michael Barbaro, Peter Goodman and Astead Herndon dissect <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/trump-tariffs-trade.html">what’s at stake for consumers and businesses</a> caught up in the president’s trade war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Huge Tariffs, Small African Economies: </strong>The amount of manufactured goods exported from Africa to the United States is minuscule. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/business/economy/lesotho-trump-tariffs-trade.html">But for Lesotho, the impact of a 50 percent tariff is enormous</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Senate Republicans Question Tariffs: </strong>Some Republican senators on Capitol Hill, including one of President Trump’s most ardent supporters, have<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/economy/ted-cruz-trump-tariffs-republicans.html"> signaled their uneasiness to the sweeping global tariffs</a> that sent global markets reeling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Digital Commerce Companies</strong>: These businesses, including e-commerce platforms and payment processors, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/technology/tariffs-digital-commerce.html">pulling back on public offering plans</a> and bracing for pain.</p></li><li><p><strong> Investors Recoil: </strong>Stocks hadn’t fallen this far this fast since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.
