An unverified video from the scene, <a href="https://t.me/rian_ru/274590" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published by RIA Novosti</a>, a Russian state news agency, showed injured people being pulled from the wreckage. In the video, some passengers were lying on the ground, while others were able to walk away from the plane.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The emergency ministry <a href="https://t.me/qr_tjm/19933" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted photographs</a> that it said were from the scene showing firefighters searching through the debris. One photograph appeared to show the tail of the plane largely intact, though it had been separated from the fuselage.</p><p>The Azerbaijan Airlines plane had been trying to make an emergency landing in Aktau after hitting a flock of birds, Russia’s state aviation authority said in a statement <a href="https://t.me/rian_ru/274589" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cited by RIA Novosti</a> soon after the crash. The airline said in <a href="https://t.me/AzerbaijanAirlines/2014" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> that its plane had come down about 1.8 miles away from Aktau. Kazakhstan’s Emergency Situations Ministry said it had opened an investigation into the causes of the crash.</p><p>Later on Wednesday, Azerbaijan’s Prosecutor General’s Office said in <a href="https://t.me/prokurorluq/12410" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> that it had opened a criminal investigation. The office said that it had dispatched a team of investigators to the scene. Similar criminal investigations were also opened in Russia and Kazakhstan.</p><p>The Embraer-190 plane was traveling to Grozny, in Russia’s Chechnya republic in the North Caucasus, from Baku, the Azerbaijani capital on the Caspian Sea. RIA Novosti reported that the plane had been rerouted to Kazakhstan because of fog in Grozny.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The airline <a href="https://t.me/AzerbaijanAirlines/2021" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> that it was suspending flights from Baku to Grozny and Makhachkala, in neighboring Dagestan, until investigations into the cause of the crash had concluded.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/25/multimedia/25kazakhstan-vfgp/25kazakhstan-vfgp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/25/multimedia/25kazakhstan-vfgp/25kazakhstan-vfgp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/25/multimedia/25kazakhstan-vfgp/25kazakhstan-vfgp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Azerbaijan’s president wears a black suit and tie and looks down." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/25/multimedia/25kazakhstan-vfgp/25kazakhstan-vfgp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/25/multimedia/25kazakhstan-vfgp/25kazakhstan-vfgp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/25/multimedia/25kazakhstan-vfgp/25kazakhstan-vfgp-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/25/multimedia/25kazakhstan-vfgp/25kazakhstan-vfgp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/b2f459d1-2bb7-569e-8e5e-25682331487f" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, declared Thursday a day of mourning for the victims.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rafiq Maqbool/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Earlier on Wednesday, Flightradar24, a flight tracking service, said in <a href="https://x.com/flightradar24/status/1871853766191804673" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a post</a> on the social media platform X that the plane had been “exposed to GPS jamming and spoofing near Grozny.” Radar jamming is often used to defend an area against drones. It was not immediately clear whether this had played any role in the crash.</p><p>On Wednesday, local news outlets in Chechnya reported drone strikes against the republic. Grozny Inform, a state-run news website in Chechnya, <a href="https://www.grozny-inform.ru/news/crime/167572/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cited Khamzat Kadyrov</a>, a local security official, as stating that all of the drones had been shot down. The reports could not be independently verified. Ukrainian drones have hit various targets in Chechnya in recent weeks, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-grozny-drone-attack-7655bcd300e3e11e28f571a613d59ef0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including a site</a> belonging to a riot police battalion.</p><p>Kazakhstan’s <a href="https://t.me/kolikpress/20222" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">transportation ministry said</a> that the flight’s passengers included 37 Azerbaijani nationals, 16 Russians, six Kazakh citizens and three Kyrgyz nationals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called Ilham Aliyev, his Azerbaijani counterpart, to express condolences for the crash victims, according to Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman. Mr. Aliyev had been traveling to St. Petersburg, Russia, on Wednesday for a gathering of leaders of some former Soviet states, but returned to Azerbaijan because of the crash, the Kremlin said.</p><p>Mr. Aliyev declared Thursday a day of mourning for the victims.</p><p>Azerbaijan Airlines is the country’s flag carrier, formed from the regional branch of Aeroflot shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Azerbaijan Airlines inherited a fleet of Soviet planes but has since undergone a transformation, during which time most of its fleet was replaced with modern Western aircraft, according to the carrier’s website.</p><p>The airline’s last major episode was in 2005, when an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/27/world/world-briefing-europe-azerbaijan-airline-suspends-flights.html" title="">An-140 plane crashed</a> shortly after takeoff, killing 18 passengers and five crew members. Airline officials later <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna10588624" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said the crash</a> was caused by instrument failure.</p><p>Milana Mazaeva<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ivan Nechepurenko covers Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the countries of the Caucasus, and Central Asia.
