    <h1>Shoulder Season</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>I received the “They’re back!” text from my friend Greg in Oxford, Miss., on Monday evening. “They” were the Halloween inflatables festooning his neighbor’s lawn, as depicted in an accompanying photo: a jack-o’-lantern with a ghost flailing from each eye, Skeleton Medusa, two spiders the size of Volkswagen Beetles. Greg knows I’m appalled at the ever-earlier arrival of spooky-season décor.</p><p>Mid-September, still summer by the astronomical calendar. I went to the website of “The Old Farmer’s Almanac” for some sanity. No comfort there: “Thanksgiving Weather Forecast 2024 — With U.S. Travel Map!” the headline chirped, gleefully premature. “Who decides on the seasons,” I searched, just to be a brat. I know what’s happening: Tomorrow morning, at 8:44 a.m., the sun, heading southward, will cross the celestial equator. No matter what post-Labor Day stalwarts on Cape Cod told my colleague Steven Kurutz about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/style/september-summer-month.html" title="">September’s being a summer month</a>, if you’re currently residing in the Northern Hemisphere, the argument’s over: Tomorrow’s fall.</p><p>I’m relieved, at this point, to stop the charade; enough with this yearning. It was 82 degrees in New York City last weekend, but it wasn’t really hot. It was a noncommittal hot, bright but withholding. When the sun went behind a building, it felt like an abandonment. I picture the months of September through December as a long slide. You’re at the top at Labor Day, maybe holding on to the railing, afraid to let go of August. By the time you get to the equinox, the descent is fully underway. You’re picking up momentum: Oct. 1, Halloween, Election Day, changing the clocks; buckle in, here come the holidays. You land at the end of December, with a flying leap into the new year (if you’re blessed), or with a thud, in a puddle (if you’re me), or you just land on your feet (a good goal for all of us).</p><p>“Don’t talk to me of solemn days / In autumn’s time of splendor,” Paul Laurence Dunbar wrote, denouncing those who would portray fall as a time of sadness and decay. I’m persuadable. Last weekend, as the sky turned pink and the sun set on an outdoor concert in Queens, I closed my eyes and tried to feel the chill enter the air, to detect the exact moment it went from short-sleeves weather to sweater weather.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The threshold between one season and another, between one moment and the next, between one way of being and the next one: There’s power there. If you can identify the demarcation and pause in it, you can turn your head one way and see where you’ve been, turn the other and see where you’re going. We’re doing so many things and moving so quickly that these moments usually slip by unacknowledged. We don’t realize we were in portal until we’ve already passed through it.</p><h2 id="link-3c1c6048">For more</h2><ul><li><p>New England isn’t the only place where you can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/travel/fall-foliage-colorado-michigan.html" title="">see fall foliage</a>.</p></li><li><p>Lindsey Zoladz’s most anticipated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/arts/music/amplifier-newsletter-fall-albums.html" title="">albums of fall</a>.</p></li><li><p>Fall <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/books/fiction-books-fall.html" title="">fiction</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/books/new-nonfiction-books-fall.html" title="">nonfiction</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/movies/fall-movies.html" title="">movies</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/arts/television/fall-tv-shows.html" title="">TV</a>.</p></li><li><p>I’m collecting poems that sing of the glories of this time of year.

Children’s films are too rare these days; memorable ones are scarcer still. But this one promises well. Written and directed by Chris Sanders (“Lilo &amp; Stitch”), it is an adaptation of Peter Brown’s stern and lyrical middle-grade novel, a meditation on community, found families and adapting to new environments. It stars the voices of Lupita Nyong’o as the title automaton and Kit Connor as the gosling she adopts.</p><h3 id="link-63067b6e"><span><strong>RECIPE OF THE WEEK</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bryan Gardner for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-4c50bad">Gochugaru Salmon With Crispy Rice</h2><p>Hello!
