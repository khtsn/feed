                  <p>PLAYzone <a href="https://www.playzone.cz/clanky/228604-letos-usporadame-ctyri-mezinarodni-akce-jedna-z-nich-zamiri-na-herni-festival-mcr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">has announced</a> its roadmap for 2026, with four tournaments and nearly $100,000 in prizes to be given out. The Czech tournament organizer has its eyes set on becoming a staple of the tier-two circuit with two VRS LANs and two open cups.</p>
                  <p>The first LAN will be Tipsport Conquest of Prague, which PLAYzone already ran in 2025 with a grand final featuring <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4991/fnatic" data-tooltip-id="uid1821767821">fnatic</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4869/ence" data-tooltip-id="uid977784994">ENCE</a>. This year, it will start with four online qualifiers, including one for a local team, before it moves to a LAN final with 12 teams invited via VRS. It will take place at the Vodafone PLAYZone Arena in Prague on May 22-24 with a ~$35,000 prize pool.</p>
                  <p>Two buy-in open cups for 12 teams from around the world will follow, also taking place at the Vodafone PLAYzone Arena on August 5-9 and September 23-27. Each tournament will feature a ~$13,000 prize pool. Eight teams will start in the group stage, while the four highest-ranked according to the VRS will start straight from the playoffs.</p>
                  <p>For all of the fans out there clamoring for IEM Brno, PLAYzone is offering the next best thing, Tipsport RUSH: Brno, an event like the aforementioned Conquest of Prague, but taking place at the BVV Brno exhibition center during the Czech Championship Gaming Festival on November 20-22. It will have 12 teams invited via the VRS ranking and four joining from online qualifiers, and will once again feature a ~$35,000 prize pool.</p>
