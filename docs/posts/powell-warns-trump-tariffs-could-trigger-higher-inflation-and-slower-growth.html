We may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual mandate goals are in tension. If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close. These are very fundamental changes in — long-held in some cases — policies in the United States, and there’s not any real experience. I mean, the Smoot-Hawley tariffs were actually not this large and they were 95 years ago. So there isn’t a modern experience of how to think about this. And businesses and households are saying in surveys that they are experiencing incredibly high uncertainty. I mean, your question really is what if the uncertainty remains high? I think that’s a difficult environment. If the United States were to become a jurisdiction where risks are just structurally higher going forward, that would make us less attractive as a jurisdiction. We don’t know that at this point. But I think that would be the effect.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/16/multimedia/16dc-powell-vfzl/16dc-powell-vfzl-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Jerome H.

Powell, the chair of the central bank, recently warned that levies of the scope and scale Mr. Trump was pursuing would most likely lead to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/economy/powell-trump-tariff-inflation-risk.html" title="">even higher inflation and slower growth</a> than initially expected — the makings of what’s known as a stagflationary shock.</p><p>Mr. Powell expanded on those remarks on Wednesday, stressing that the tariffs announced so far go well beyond what the Fed had expected even in its worst-case scenario. In a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago, he laid out in greater detail how the Fed would deal with a situation in which its goals for a healthy labor market as well as low and stable inflation clashed with each other.</p><p>“We may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are in tension,” Mr. Powell said. “If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal, and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a moderated discussion after his speech, Mr. Powell said the Fed would have to make “what will no doubt be a very difficult judgment&#34; about which of its goals to prioritize.</p><p>Mr. Powell’s comment accelerated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/business/stocks-trump-tariffs.html" title="">a sell-off in stocks</a>, with the S&amp;P 500 ending the day down more than 2 percent. U.S. government bonds rallied, while the dollar continued to weaken against a basket of major currencies.</p><p>The recent whiplash over which products are subject to tariffs, by how much and for how long has stoked extreme uncertainty about the economic outlook, leading to diverging views about when the central bank may be able to cut interest rates again.</p><p>So far, most officials have taken the view that the inflationary impact from tariffs should not be underestimated, especially in light of certain measures of inflation expectations that show consumers starting to anticipate higher prices. Mr. Powell on Wednesday again warned that Mr. Trump’s policies could breed persistently higher inflation and reiterated that it was the Fed’s “obligation” to ensure that “a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.”</p><p>He also said he would be closely monitoring how long it took for the inflationary impact to flow through the economy. In some sectors, like the automobile industry, he warned that supply chains could be “disrupted significantly.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“You would worry that that process will take some years, and that the inflationary process might be extended,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Powell made clear that keeping expectations about future inflation in check was the Fed’s top priority.</p><p>“Without price stability, we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor market conditions that benefit all Americans,” Mr. Powell added. He stressed that the Fed could afford to be patient on taking further action on interest rates until it had more clarity about the economic outlook.</p><p>Overall, Mr. Powell’s remarks suggest that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/business/federal-reserve-trump-tariffs-inflation.html" title="">bar for interest rate cuts is high</a>, meaning that the central bank is likely to need tangible evidence that the labor market is cracking before it takes action. Economists in this camp see the Fed’s keeping interest rates at their current range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent for the remainder of the year before lowering them in 2026.</p><p>But other perspectives have started to emerge at the Fed as well, underscoring the vast uncertainty that Mr. Trump’s policies have stoked.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>One outlier is Christopher Waller, a Fed governor. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/politics/fed-tariffs-inflation.html" title="">laid out an argument</a> on Monday for why surging inflation from Mr. Trump’s tariffs could be temporary, reviving a view that came to haunt the central bank after the supply-chain shock that followed the Covid-19 pandemic. Officials had initially billed the price pressures as “transitory,” resulting in the Fed’s keeping interest rates too low for too long and worsening the extent of the inflation problem, which they have yet to fully overcome.</p><p>The crux of Mr. Waller’s argument is that tariffs of the magnitude that the president has put in place, if sustained, will be so damaging to economic growth and the labor market that it will weigh on inflation over time.</p><p>Using a scenario in which the average tariff imposed on U.S. imports remains around its current level of 25 percent for an extended period, the Fed governor forecast consumer price growth to spike to around 4 percent this year before fading as the economy slowed “to a crawl” and the unemployment rate jumped to 5 percent. The unemployment rate currently stands at 4.2 percent.</p><p>“I expect the risk of recession would outweigh the risk of escalating inflation, especially if the effects of tariffs in raising inflation are expected to be short-lived,” said Mr. Waller, who was appointed to the central bank by Mr. Trump in his first term. That would support interest rate cuts “sooner and to a greater extent” than initially expected, he added.</p><p>In the event that Mr. Trump keeps in place a more modest 10 percent universal tariff and removes other levies, Mr. Waller said, the Fed could afford to be more patient about cuts as the likely inflation bump and growth slowdown would be more muted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Powell was also asked about the recent turbulence in U.S. financial markets. Stocks have finally steadied after a week of heavy losses that were accompanied by a sharp sell-off in U.S. government bonds and the dollar. Typically investors flock to those assets during times of stress, so the unusual trifecta of selling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/business/economy/bonds-tariffs-safe-haven.html" title="">fanned fears</a> that the country’s safe haven status was under threat.</p><p>Mr. Powell said financial markets were “orderly and functioning as you would expect them to in this time of high uncertainty,” even as he warned of the possibility of “continued volatility.” He added that the central bank stood ready to provide dollar funding as needed.</p><p>“We want to make sure that dollars are available,” he said.</p><p>Asked about the Fed’s ability to set interest rates free from political interference, Mr. Powell said the central bank’s independence was a “matter of law” and something that had bipartisan support. He mentioned a legal challenge that is set to be heard by the Supreme Court involving Mr. Trump’s ability to fire officials at independent agencies, but said he did not expect that decision to apply to the Fed.</p><p>“It’s a situation we are monitoring carefully,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Colby Smith covers the Federal Reserve and the U.S. economy for The Times.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>B</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>3</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Fed Chair Sets Plan if Inflation Grows and Growth Slows<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/christopher-waller">Christopher Waller</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/federal-reserve-the-fed">Federal Reserve (The Fed)</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Control via Confidentiality:</strong> Bryan Johnson — a longevity guru and the founder of Blueprint — has wielded confidentiality agreements to control his image and the companies he built atop it.
