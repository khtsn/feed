    <h1>One Year After Oct. 7, Peace Seems More Elusive Than Ever</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>On this day last year, Hamas militants stormed into Israel, killed more than 1,200 Israelis, committed atrocities and took more than 250 people back to Gaza as hostages. We are still living in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/06/world/israel-hamas-october-7-gaza-war" title="">the aftermath</a>.</p><p>Across Israel and around the world today, solemn memorials were held to commemorate the victims and survivors of the deadliest day in the country’s history. At a ceremony in a kibbutz just outside Gaza, explosions from Israeli airstrikes could be heard — a reminder that the Oct. 7 attacks set off a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-oct-7-year-of-war.html" title="">war that continues to spread, with no end in sight</a>.</p><p>That war centers on Israel’s insistence on destroying Hamas and freeing the Israeli hostages, but it has spread to Lebanon and Iran, and peace in the Middle East seems more elusive than ever. The Israeli military today <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/07/world/israel-iran-hezbollah-lebanon" title="">mounted attacks on two fronts</a>.</p><p>The war has also become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/world/middleeast/israel-palestinians-war.html" title="">a battle over narratives</a>. For Israel, Oct. 7 summoned in Jews every devouring specter of the Holocaust. But as Gaza has turned into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/world/middleeast/gaza-civilians-deaths-israel-war.html" title="">a mass death trap</a> — with more than 40,000 people killed, mostly civilians — Palestinians and some international leaders have criticized Israel’s response and accused it of war crimes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A house in St. Pete Beach, Fla., today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Octavio Jones/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kamala Harris at a campaign event in Flint, Mich., on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Elconin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-4cc3c6da">Get ready to hear a lot from Harris</h2><p>With less than a month before the election and no more debates on the schedule, Vice President Kamala Harris set off this week on a media blitz. Many of her stops will be with friendly hosts, on daytime and late-night TV. But tonight, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/07/us/harris-trump-election" title="">Harris will appear on “60 Minutes,”</a> for what is sure to be a closely watched interview. The special will not include an interview with Donald Trump, who backed out last week.</p><p>This final stretch is likely to be crucial because Harris and Trump are nearly tied in polls in all seven battleground states. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/05/us/politics/trump-harris-30-days-to-election.html" title="">We took a look at both candidates’ strategies</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christine Olsson/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hedi Slimane in 2003.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Max Lautenschlaeger/Visum, Redux</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-2415092d">Hedi Slimane has changed fashion</h2><p>The designer Hedi Slimane first transformed men’s clothing in the late ’90s with the super skinny suit. He then went on to impose his style at Dior and, most recently, Celine. Now, the fashion world is speculating about him taking over Chanel — linking an already mythic designer with the brand that Coco built.</p><p>But our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, has a different idea. Slimane’s penchant for changing a brand’s look to fit his vision, not the other way around, has created a recipe for monotony across the industry. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/style/hedi-slimane-celine-chanel.html" title="">Perhaps it’s time for him to start a label of his own</a>, Vanessa writes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h2 id="link-6a2e11e7">Have we reached peak life span?</h2><p>Around the world, life expectancy has been rising for decades thanks to medical and technological advancements.

Or, at least, there’s a far better chance now than if this newsletter was sent out two decades ago. On average, Americans spent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/05/upshot/americans-homebodies-alone-census.html" title="">1 hour 39 minutes a day more at home</a> in 2022 compared with 2003, according to census data.</p><p>It’s a trend that rose sharply during the pandemic, especially with the rise of remote jobs. But it began many years before most of us had ever heard of Covid. The largest shift affected religious activities: 59 percent occurred at home in 2022, up from 24 percent in 2003.</p><p>Have a comfortable evening.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Thanks for reading.
