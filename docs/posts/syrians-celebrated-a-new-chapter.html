Elsewhere in the country, Russia’s military appeared to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/13/world/syria-news#russia-military-syria" title="">packing up equipment at a critical base</a>. </p><p>A Times analysis of satellite images of the Khmeimim air base showed transport planes prepared for loading and Russian equipment apparently being packed up nearby.

In 2022, the lawyer, Aaron Siri, asked the U.S. government to revoke its approval of the polio vaccine, which for decades has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/health/polio-vaccine-placebo.html" title="">protected millions of people from a virus</a> that can cause paralysis or death.</p><p>Kennedy, whom Donald Trump picked to be health secretary, has said that he does not want to take away access to any vaccines.
