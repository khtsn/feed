She was 63.</p><p>Her death, at the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice, was caused by ovarian cancer, according to her manager, Chris Davis. Ms. Godley announced in September that she had exhausted her treatment options and had entered palliative care.</p><p>She gained a following during the coronavirus pandemic performing parodies that reimagined what officials were saying — or perhaps secretly thinking — during their public addresses. One favorite subject was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGYMLxQPE_U&amp;ab_channel=JaneyGodley" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s leader at the time</a>.</p><p>Ms. Sturgeon seemed to appreciate the humor, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NicolaSturgeonSNP/posts/thanks-to-my-alter-ego-janey-godley-for-my-copy-of-frankgetthedoor-janey-frank-a/4593527857355761/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calling</a> Ms. Godley her “alter ego.” Ms. Godley’s videos, some <a href="https://rse.org.uk/event/voices-of-covid-kirsty-wark-and-janey-godley-in-conversation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">observers said</a>, led her to become a distinctive voice helping to spread public health messages during the pandemic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Other world leaders were not spared Ms. Godley’s voice-over treatment. Her targets also included Prime Ministers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9FD8MJ3Kxg&amp;ab_channel=JaneyGodley" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Boris Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYpR52etUoQ&amp;ab_channel=JaneyGodley" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Theresa May</a> of Britain, President <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6OnaABhiAQ&amp;ab_channel=JaneyGodley" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Donald J. Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOkgb7BgmS0&amp;ab_channel=JaneyGodley" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Queen Elizabeth II</a>.</p><p>“Here’s the thing: Women my age are constantly being told we don’t know how to work the internet — but I nailed it,” she <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/life_style/arts_ents/18323654.janey-godley-women-age-told-dont-know-work-internet-showed-kids-done/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joked</a> in an interview. “I showed these 22-year-olds how it’s done.”</p><p>Even before her internet fame, Ms. Godley was a mainstay on the Scottish comedy circuit. She won comedy awards in Britain and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29Sl_BgEZZc&amp;ab_channel=JaneyGodley" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New Zealand</a>, and performed regularly at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.</p><p>The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/26/theater/drama-sport-for-culture-die-hards-endurance-reaps-rewards-edinburgh-fringe.html" title="">described</a> her 2004 festival show, “Good Godley,” as “some of the sharpest-elbowed comedy in the world.” She won an <a href="https://www.glasgowcomedyfestival.com/janey-godley-wins-inaugural-sir-billy-connolly-spirit-of-glasgow-award/#:~:text=Festival%20Guide-,Janey%20Godley%20wins%20inaugural%20Sir%20Billy%20Connolly%20Spirit%20of%20Glasgow,at%20the%20official%20Closing%20Gala." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">award</a> at the Glasgow International Comedy Festival in 2023, bestowed by the Scottish comedian Billy Connolly.</p><p>Her hallmark in comedy was to bring no-nonsense humor to the most harrowing of topics, drawn from her own experiences of loss and hardship.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Being onstage is just the best feeling in the world,” she said in a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4cQMH3nqrdM8sNgfSssz8lL/janey-godley-i-lived-with-the-stench-of-threat-everywhere" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BBC Radio Scotland interview</a>. “It’s the one place where I can take complete control of everything. And hearing everybody laugh when you speak — it’s like verbal heroin. You get addicted to it!”</p><p>Jane Godley Currie was born on Jan. 20, 1961, in Glasgow, one of four children. Her family was poor, and her parents struggled with alcohol and substance use disorders.</p><p>“When I was a kid, I would say funny things to relieve the obvious tension in the house,” she told the BBC.</p><p>Ms. Godley and her sister were sexually abused as children by their uncle, and he was found <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12126591.abuser-convicted-after-30-years/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">guilty</a> of the abuse after they came forward 30 years later. She married into a family with apparent criminal connections and managed a pub in Calton, where she witnessed a heroin epidemic.</p><p>But being a pub manager sharpened her quick-fire banter, she said. When she decided to take her comedy more seriously in the mid-1990s, she did not shy away from her past. Much of it formed the basis of her 2005 memoir, “<a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/343481/handstands-in-the-dark-by-janey-godley/9781529106862" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Handstands in the Dark</a>.”</p><p>“I decided to tackle subjects people don’t normally tackle,” Ms. Godley <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/mum-was-murdered-and-my-in-laws-are-gangsters-2463817" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a 2004 interview, adding that there were “funny sides” to terrible experiences. She became a regular on BBC comedy shows, acted in film and television, and wrote several books.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>She is survived by her husband, Sean Storrie, and a daughter, Ashley Storrie.</p><p>Ms. Godley also brought her voice to politics.</p><p>A <a href="https://x.com/JaneyGodley/status/694925938279194624" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supporter</a> of the center-left Scottish National Party who praised Jeremy Corbyn’s bid for prime minister, she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAulPWvWkus&amp;ab_channel=JaneyGodley" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">protested</a> Mr. Trump’s visit to his Turnberry golf course in 2016 with a crude sign that garnered widespread attention.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Godley at a march in support of Scottish independence in Edinburgh in 2019.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeff J Mitchell/Getty</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In 2021, The Daily Beast <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/janey-godley-stars-in-governments-covid-ads-despite-shocking-racist-tweets/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unearthed</a> a series of offensive social media posts that Ms. Godley had made about several Black American celebrities. Ms. Godley <a href="https://x.com/JaneyGodley/status/1435302532801257476" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">apologized</a>, saying she was “deeply sorry.”</p><p>She revealed that she had ovarian cancer that same year.
