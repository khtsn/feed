She was 63.</p><p>She died of ovarian cancer at the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice, according to her manager, Chris Davis.</p><p>Ms. Godley, with her signature candor, announced in September that she had exhausted her treatment options and had entered palliative care. She is survived by her husband, Sean Storrie, and a daughter, Ashley Storrie.</p><p>Ms. Godley gained a following during the coronavirus pandemic for sharing parodies that reimagined what officials were saying — or perhaps secretly thinking — during their public addresses. One favored subject was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGYMLxQPE_U&amp;ab_channel=JaneyGodley" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s leader at the time</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Sturgeon seemed to appreciate the humor, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NicolaSturgeonSNP/posts/thanks-to-my-alter-ego-janey-godley-for-my-copy-of-frankgetthedoor-janey-frank-a/4593527857355761/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calling</a> Ms. Godley her “alter ego.” Ms. Godley’s videos, some <a href="https://rse.org.uk/event/voices-of-covid-kirsty-wark-and-janey-godley-in-conversation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">observers said</a>, led her to become a “distinctive” voice during the pandemic that helped spread public health messages.</p><p>Other world leaders were not exempt from being targets. Ms. Godley’s voice-overs also included former Prime Ministers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9FD8MJ3Kxg&amp;ab_channel=JaneyGodley" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Boris Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYpR52etUoQ&amp;ab_channel=JaneyGodley" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Theresa May</a> of Britain, former President <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6OnaABhiAQ&amp;ab_channel=JaneyGodley" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a> of the United States and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOkgb7BgmS0&amp;ab_channel=JaneyGodley" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Queen Elizabeth II</a> of England.</p><p>“Here’s the thing: Women my age are constantly being told we don’t know how to work the internet — but I nailed it,” she <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/life_style/arts_ents/18323654.janey-godley-women-age-told-dont-know-work-internet-showed-kids-done/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joked</a> in an interview. “I showed these 22-year-olds how it’s done.”</p><p>Even before her internet fame, Ms. Godley was a mainstay on the Scottish comedy circuit. She won comedy awards in Britain and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29Sl_BgEZZc&amp;ab_channel=JaneyGodley" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New Zealand</a>, and performed regularly at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.</p><p>The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/26/theater/drama-sport-for-culture-die-hards-endurance-reaps-rewards-edinburgh-fringe.html" title="">described</a> her 2004 festival show, “Good Godley,” among other acts, as “some of the sharpest-elbowed comedy in the world.” She won an <a href="https://www.glasgowcomedyfestival.com/janey-godley-wins-inaugural-sir-billy-connolly-spirit-of-glasgow-award/#:~:text=Festival%20Guide-,Janey%20Godley%20wins%20inaugural%20Sir%20Billy%20Connolly%20Spirit%20of%20Glasgow,at%20the%20official%20Closing%20Gala." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">award</a> at the Glasgow International Comedy Festival in 2023 bestowed by the Scottish comedian Billy Connolly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Her hallmark in comedy was to bring no-nonsense humor to the most harrowing of topics, drawn from her own experiences of loss and hardship.</p><p>“Being onstage is just the best feeling in the world,” she said in a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4cQMH3nqrdM8sNgfSssz8lL/janey-godley-i-lived-with-the-stench-of-threat-everywhere" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BBC Radio Scotland interview</a>. “It’s the one place where I can take complete control of everything. And hearing everybody laugh when you speak — it’s like verbal heroin. You get addicted to it!”</p><p>Jane Godley Currie was born on Jan. 20, 1961, in Glasgow, one of four children. Her family was poor, and her parents struggled with alcohol and substance use disorders.</p><p>“When I was a kid, I would say funny things to relieve the obvious tension in the house,” she told the BBC.</p><p>Ms. Godley and her sister were sexually abused as children by their uncle, and he was found <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12126591.abuser-convicted-after-30-years/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">guilty</a> of the abuse after they came forward 30 years later. She married into a family with apparent criminal connections and managed a pub in Calton, where she witnessed a heroin epidemic.</p><p>But being a pub manager sharpened her quick-fire banter, she said. When she decided to take her comedy more seriously in the mid-1990s, she did not shy away from her past. Much of it also formed the basis of her 2005 memoir, “<a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/343481/handstands-in-the-dark-by-janey-godley/9781529106862" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Handstands in the Dark</a>.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I decided to tackle subjects people don’t normally tackle,” she <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/mum-was-murdered-and-my-in-laws-are-gangsters-2463817" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a 2004 interview, adding that there were “funny sides” to terrible experiences. She became a regular on BBC comedy shows, acted in film and television, and wrote several books.</p><p>She also brought her voice to politics.</p><p>A <a href="https://x.com/JaneyGodley/status/694925938279194624" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supporter</a> of the center-left Scottish National Party who also praised Jeremy Corbyn’s bid for prime minister, she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAulPWvWkus&amp;ab_channel=JaneyGodley" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">protested</a> Mr. Trump’s visit to his Turnberry golf course in 2016 with a crude sign that garnered widespread attention.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Godley at a march in support of Scottish independence in Edinburgh in 2019.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeff J Mitchell/Getty</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In 2021, The Daily Beast <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/janey-godley-stars-in-governments-covid-ads-despite-shocking-racist-tweets/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unearthed</a> a series of offensive social media posts that she had made about several Black American celebrities. Ms. Godley <a href="https://x.com/JaneyGodley/status/1435302532801257476" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">apologized</a>, saying she was “deeply sorry.”</p><p>She brought her candor back to her personal life, revealing that same year that she had ovarian cancer. After undergoing a hysterectomy, she said in 2022 that she was free of cancer, but it later returned.</p><p>Ms. Godfrey pushed forward with a “Not Yet Dead” tour in 2023 while undergoing chemotherapy.</p><p>“It is devastating news to know that I’m facing end of life, but we all come to an end sometime,” she said in a farewell <a href="https://x.com/JaneyGodley/status/1838972352702382461" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> thanking her supporters.</p><p>She signed off with an air kiss, and one last quip. “Even the ones that hate me, thanks for giving me your engagement,” she said.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
