Pei</a> in the 1980s, during the museum’s last major overhaul. The entrance was intended to welcome half the visitors it currently does.</p><p>An estimated 80 percent of those crowds come for the Mona Lisa — a magnet for droves of selfie-snapping tourists that has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/arts/design/mona-lisa-louvre-overcrowding.html" title="">a crowd-control headache</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Macron said that the dedicated room for the Mona Lisa would be one of several new exhibition spaces created underneath the Cour Carrée, the Louvre’s easternmost courtyard, and connected to the existing museum.

The new entrance would be paid for by the museum’s own funds, Mr. Macron said, although he did not provide a detailed breakdown of the overall renovation costs.</p><p>The Louvre — a former palace that was home to French kings until 1682 — is much more than a tourist attraction. It is a symbol of France’s cultural clout, and an important soft-power instrument for the French State.</p><p>For Mr. Macron, who is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/world/europe/macron-france-government.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">weakened domestically</a>, putting his imprint on the Louvre is a way to burnish his legacy, experts say — similar to his five-year bet on restoring the fire-ravaged Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/05/arts/design/notre-dame-reopens-paris.html" title="">which ultimately paid off</a>.</p><p>“He started his presidency at the Louvre, and he wants to end it at the Louvre,” Julien Lacaze, the president of <a href="https://www.sitesetmonuments.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sites et Monuments</a>, said of Mr. Macron, who delivered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/07/world/europe/emmanuel-macron-france-election-marine-le-pen.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">his first term victory speech</a> in front of the glass and steel pyramid in 2017.</p><p>The iconic pyramid is a footprint left by one of Mr. Macron’s predecessors as president, François Mitterrand, who commissioned the structure in the 1980s.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“He is working on the image that will remain in history books,” added Mr. Lacaze, whose association campaigns for the protection of France’s architectural and natural heritage.</p><p>Mr. Macron’s announcement came less than a week after the daily newspaper Le Parisien <a href="https://www.leparisien.fr/culture-loisirs/avaries-degradations-saturation-le-rapport-confidentiel-qui-alerte-sur-letat-du-musee-du-louvre-22-01-2025-VHQGISLZM5D4ZBALW3KURS44VI.php?ts=1737947341357" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/22/arts/design/laurence-des-cars-louvre.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">Laurence des Cars</a>, the Louvre’s president, had warned in a confidential memo to the French culture ministry that the museum was in desperate need of a revamp because of significant wear and tear.</p><p>Problems outlined in the memo included water leaks, temperature variations that endangered artworks, insufficient restrooms and food facilities, and poor signage. The memo also warned that the glass pyramid was structurally outdated — overheated during the summer, and too noisy year-round.</p><p>“Everywhere the building is suffering,” Ms. des Cars said on Tuesday before Mr. Macron’s speech in the Louvre’s Salle des États gallery, where the Mona Lisa is currently kept.</p><p>“Each day this very room is the scene of intense agitation,” she said, a place where frustrated and tired tourists jostle to catch a glimpse the painting.</p><p>“The Louvre’s exceptional visitor numbers are not a curse, they’re a source of pride,” she added. “It’s also a challenge to reinvent ourselves and remain faithful to our public service mission.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media"

in 2027 — had latched onto the Louvre in hopes of preserving his legacy.</p><p>Labor unions representing some of the museum’s 2,300 employees acknowledged that the building needed to be renovated but said creating a whole new entrance was not the right fix.</p><p>Sud-Solidaires, one of the labor unions, said in a <a href="https://sud-culture.org/2025/01/24/mauvaise-comedie-de-boulevard-au-louvre/#more-25718" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> last week that a “mammoth project” like a new entrance would “bring absolutely no solution to the problems” but would “undoubtedly allow Emmanuel Macron to adopt the role of savior that he is so fond of.”</p><p>Mr. Macron’s office insists that getting personally involved in the Louvre’s renovation is part of his job description, not a ploy to score political points.</p><p>“His role is to protect everything that is part of the country’s heritage, pride and influence,” said a presidential official on Monday, who in keeping with French practice was not authorized to speak publicly ahead of Mr. Macron’s speech.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The museum has an <a href="https://mini-site.louvre.fr/trimestriel/2024/Trajectoires_2023/files/assets/common/downloads/publication.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">annual budget</a> of nearly $300 million, most of which comes from its own resources like ticket sales and brand licensing, with about a third funded by the French state.</p><p>Roughly a quarter of the Louvre’s visitors are French, while rest come from around the world — mainly the United States, China and other European countries like Britain, Italy, Germany and Spain.</p><p>Mr. Lacaze, the heritage expert, said that the museum was hardly falling apart, but needed to better manage the flow of visitors, who elbow past each other to see the Mona Lisa or the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/world/europe/france-paris-olympics-louvre.html" title="">Venus de Milo</a> and often leave rooms full of other masterpieces near empty.</p><p>“It’s the biggest museum in the world, but tourists only come to see five works of art,” he said, adding that the museum should do more to promote its vast collection — nearly 500,000 pieces, of which only about 30,000 are on display — in order to peel visitors away from the buzziest attractions.</p><p>Mr. Macron partly addressed those concerns on Tuesday, saying that the newly-renovated museum would emphasize art education, with the goal of doubling the number of student visitors to 900,000 per year.</p><p>Still, Mr. Lacaze argued, better to “make the most” of what the Louvre already has “before embarking on gargantuan spending.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>C</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!--
