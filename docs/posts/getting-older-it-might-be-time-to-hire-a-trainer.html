That means packing and lugging suitcases, and having the strength to control skittish, heavy animals.</p><p>Two and a half years ago, she wanted to improve her overall fitness while also protecting an arthritic shoulder and knee. “I wanted to have the ability, strength and confidence to take on whatever life might have in store,” she said. So she started exercising with a trainer she met through her physiotherapy clinic. </p><p>The sessions have made a difference. Ms. Palmer has seen improvements in her joint mobility and range of motion, she said. “So many people accept everything as a part of aging, but it doesn’t have to be that way,” she said. “I’m going to fight to the bitter end.”</p><p>As you age, strength training <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27102172/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">twice a week</a> can help you stay healthy. It can slow age-related <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2804956/#:~:text=Muscle%20mass%20decreases%20approximately%203,to%20disability%20in%20older%20people." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">muscle mass and strength loss</a>, help maintain bone density and improve stability. But starting a new fitness program can be challenging at any age, and all the more so if you have mobility issues or joint pain. That’s where trainers can help.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Studies have shown that older adults <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Curtis-Fennell-2/publication/345233636_Effects_of_Supervised_Training_Compared_to_Unsupervised_Training_on_Physical_Activity_Muscular_Endurance_and_Cardiovascular_Parameters/links/60feec792bf3553b291420b6/Effects-of-Supervised-Training-Compared-to-Unsupervised-Training-on-Physical-Activity-Muscular-Endurance-and-Cardiovascular-Parameters.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">perform better</a> in key areas like <a href="https://karger.com/ger/article/62/3/275/148497/Effects-of-a-Supervised-versus-an-Unsupervised" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">balance</a>, <a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1532-5415.1989.tb05503.x" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flexibility and core strength</a> when they work out with a trainer instead of on their own. Having a “built-in guide” can also help with motivation, said Jennifer Heisz, an associate professor of kinesiology at McMaster University.</p><p>By teaching you to move properly, a personal trainer can help you believe in your ability to exercise safely. “Ageism can hold people back from things they could be doing but don’t think they’re supposed to,” said Dr. Heisz.</p><p>“We can start undoing this self-stereotype of ‘I can’t do that because I’m too old,’ to ‘Maybe I can do that,’ to ‘I can do that and actually I did that yesterday,’” Dr. Heisz said.</p><h2 id="link-278053c7">Injury prevention and safe progression</h2><p>As you get older, the risk of falling and getting injured increases. Two of the <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/falls-and-falls-prevention/falls-and-fractures-older-adults-causes-and-prevention#causes" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">primary risk factors</a> for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/falls/data-research/facts-stats/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">falling</a> are lower body weakness and compromised balance. </p><p>Resistance training can help, but to train for strength and balance, you need to push the boundaries of your ability to progress, said Dr. Amy West, a sports medicine physician at Northwell Health. A trainer can provide a safe environment, teach you to move correctly and suggest an exercise progression to make you stronger without risking injury, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Most patients I see aren’t getting injured doing really cool athletic things,” Dr. West said. “They get injured putting dishes in the dishwasher or picking up their grandkids.”</p><p>For Ms. Palmer, exercising with a trainer reassured her that she wasn’t damaging her joints. “She’s really good about pushing me to do things to make me stronger, but she knows there are limits,” she said.</p><h2 id="link-1205af86">Hiring a trainer on a budget</h2><p>Personal training can be expensive: A single session might range from $50 to over $100, depending on the trainer’s credentials, experience and where they’re based. But many gyms — including some YMCA, Life Time and Crunch locations — offer discounts for older adults.</p><p>Once you learn proper form and safety, you can ask your trainer to create a program for you to follow at home and schedule occasional check-ins to review your progress.</p><p>Small group training is generally more affordable, and it offers the added benefit of exercising with your peers. More than one in three older adults in the U.S. <a href="https://www.healthyagingpoll.org/reports-more/report/trends-loneliness-among-older-adults-2018-2023" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a> feeling isolated, and that loneliness can lead to an increase in all-cause <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228330427_A_Review_of_Social_Isolation_An_Important_but_Underassessed_Condition_in_Older_Adults" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mortality</a>. For older adults, exercising with others can also help them <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743516300147" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stick to a fitness routine</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Look for groups with a one-to-four ratio of trainer to clients so your instructor can provide individual feedback, suggested Nsuani Baffoe, a personal trainer and gym owner in Toronto. As your skills and confidence improve, you can try larger fitness classes.</p><h2 id="link-731bb283">Finding the right trainer for you</h2><p>Make sure your trainer is well qualified. Cedric Bryant, the president and chief executive of the American Council on Exercise, recommended looking for someone with an accredited certification from the <a href="https://www.credentialingexcellence.org/Accreditation/Earn-Accreditation/NCCA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Commission for Certifying Agencies</a>, and confirming their credentials through the searchable database from the <a href="https://usreps.org/registry/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Coalition for the Registration of Exercise Professionals</a>.</p><p>If you have chronic health conditions, not all trainers will have the expertise to properly create your fitness program, said Dr. Heisz. Clinical exercise physiologists are trained to work with people with medical conditions, and your doctor may be able to recommend one.</p><p>It’s also a good idea to look for someone who has experience working with older adults and adjusting for common concerns like osteoarthritis and mobility limitations, Mr. Baffoe said. Ask if one of the trainer’s clients could provide a reference so you can see if they’re a good match for your needs, he added.</p><p>Before beginning any exercise program, talk to your doctor about whether it’s safe for you, said Dr. Heisz. Your trainer should begin with an assessment to understand your goals and limitations.</p><p>“Not all personal trainers are the same,” said Dr. Heisz. “You should shop around to find the one that you fit with best.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
