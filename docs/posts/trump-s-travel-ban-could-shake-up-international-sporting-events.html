While some of the countries on the ban list, like Chad and Yemen, are not traditional sporting powers, others, like Iran and Haiti, could well expect to send athletes to the United States for a range of competitions.</p><p>Mr. Trump also imposed a lower level of restrictions on seven other countries, including Cuba, a strong player on the international sporting stage, and Venezuela.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Decisions will have to be made quickly. The CONCACAF Gold Cup, the men’s soccer championship for North American, Central American and Caribbean nations, begins June 14 and will be played at sites across the United States (and one in Canada). Haiti has qualified for the competition and is scheduled to play games in San Diego, Houston and Arlington, Texas.</p><p>The Club World Cup, the world championship for men’s club soccer teams, also begins June 14 in several U.S. cities. No team based in a country on the banned list has qualified, but the teams involved include players and staff members from all over the world.</p><p>CONCACAF, which runs the Gold Cup, and FIFA, which runs the Club World Cup, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Other events coming to the United States this year — including the under-19 softball World Cup and the world skateboarding championships — are less likely to be considered “major” events. There are also big races, like the Chicago and New York marathons in the fall. Mr. Rubio may find himself facing a lot of judgment calls.</p><p>The implications for college athletics, where rosters in many sports are dotted with international students, are also unclear.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Both events that are explicitly exempted from the ban — the men’s soccer World Cup and the Summer Olympics — are coming to the United States after this year. The World Cup is scheduled for 2026, and Iran has already qualified. (Hosting duties will be shared with Canada and Mexico.) Los Angeles will host the Summer Olympics in 2028.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Victor Mather, who has been a reporter and editor at The Times for 25 years, covers sports and breaking news.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Emergency Abortions</strong><strong>:</strong> The Trump administration announced that it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/us/politics/trump-emergency-abortion-rule.html">revoked a Biden administration requirement</a> that hospitals provide emergency abortions to women whose health is in peril, including in states where abortion is restricted or banned.</p></li><li><p><strong>Crucial Global Vaccination Programs: </strong>The Trump administration’s proposed budget for the coming fiscal year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/health/trump-budget-global-health-polio.html">eliminates funding for programs that provide lifesaving vaccines</a> around the world, including immunizations for polio.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump and Antisemitism:</strong> President Trump’s effort to punish Harvard over antisemitism is complicated by his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/us/politics/trump-antisemitism.html">extensive history of amplifying white supremacist figures and symbols</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Science Funding: </strong>Thousands of scientists, academics, physicians and researchers have responded to the administration’s executive order about “restoring a gold standard for science,” which puts Trump’s political appointees in charge of vetting scientific research and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/climate/executive-order-gold-standard-science.html">gives them the authority to “correct scientific information</a>.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Kennedy Center: </strong>Ticket sales and subscription revenue at the John F.
