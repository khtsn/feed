Brian Thompson</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>A man was arrested on gun charges in Altoona, P.a. on Monday in connection with last week’s fatal shooting of Brian Thompson, the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare, New York City officials said during a news conference.</p><p>The man, who the authorities identified as Luigi Mangione, 26, was found after a tip from an employee at a McDonald’s in Altoona, who saw him eating there. Mr. Mangione was found with a ghost gun, a silencer and false identification cards similar to those believed to have been used by the killer, officials said.</p><p>He was also found with a three-page handwritten manifesto that showed he had “some ill will toward corporate America,” Joseph Kenny, the New York Police Department’s chief of detectives, said during the news conference, held Monday afternoon.</p><p>In addition to the false identification cards, Mr. Mangione was carrying identification with his name on it. He currently faces only local charges and will need to be extradited to New York in order to be charged there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/nyregion/uhc-ceo-manhunt-frank-james.html" title="">intense manhunt for the suspect unfolded</a> over a period of nearly a week, as the authorities traced his arrival in New York and his route before and after the killing. A picture began to emerge of the suspect as a shrewd and elusive operator.</p><h2 id="link-52ef6471">What do officials know about Luigi Mangione so far?</h2><p>Mr. Mangione was born and raised in Maryland, the authorities said at the news conference. He had ties to San Francisco and had also recently lived in Honolulu, Hawaii. So far, his only known tie to Pennsylvania is that he went to college there, the authorities said.</p><p>A person with the same name as Mr. Mangione was valedictorian at a private high school in the Baltimore area and went on to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania in 2020 with degrees in engineering, according to a school commencement program.</p><p>Mr. Mangione had no known criminal record in New York.</p><h2 id="link-7eda07d9">When did the gunman arrive in Manhattan?</h2><p>The suspect appears to have arrived in Manhattan 10 days before the shooting, on Nov. 24, a senior law enforcement official said. He came on a bus that originated in Atlanta and checked into the HI New York City Hostel on Amsterdam Avenue near 104th Street in Manhattan. He checked out on Nov. 29 and then checked back in the next day, the official said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>When he returned, on Nov. 30, he used fake New Jersey identification to book a room, the senior law enforcement official said. On Thursday, the police released two surveillance stills of the man who was believed to be the shooter with his mask down. The photos appear to have been taken at the hostel, where he had shared a room with two strangers, the senior law enforcement official said. It remains unclear when the photos were taken.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>New York police officers exiting the HI New York City Hostel, where the suspect stayed, in Manhattan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Caitlin Ochs for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-341847b7">Why has it taken so long to catch him?</h2><p>Mr. Thompson was gunned down in one of the busiest and most intensely surveilled neighborhoods in the country, during an especially busy season for shoppers and tourists. The Police Department has years of experience <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/nyregion/ceo-brian-thompson-gunman-video.html" title="">using images from surveillance cameras and drones</a> to find and capture criminals. The department dispatched scores of officers and detectives, dogs and drones to search the city and to research tips, which arrived from all over the country.</p><p>Part of the reason the manhunt has stretched on for so long appears to be that the suspect was camera-savvy, as the senior law enforcement official said. None of the surveillance images released by the police showed his face entirely unobscured. Even in the pictures released on Thursday, he was wearing a hood. Late Saturday, the police <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/nyregion/uhc-ceo-shooting-suspect-photos.html" title="">shared two more images</a>; in both, the man pictured was wearing a blue surgical mask and had a hood pulled over his head. In one of the photos, he is seen in the back seat of a taxi on the day of the shooting.</p><p>The gunman’s apparent getaway route, cycling north into Central Park before exiting and hailing a taxi on the Upper West Side, also may have helped him, because the park has many areas with no cameras.</p><p>Investigators are examining whether a cellphone left near the scene belonged to the gunman and was not a decoy or a so-called burner phone, according to a person with knowledge of the investigation. The police have not yet gained access to the device.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>On Friday, officers also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/nyregion/unitedhealthcare-ceo-gunman-backpack.html" title="">recovered a backpack</a> in Central Park that they believed the man may have discarded, but it was not immediately clear whether it had yielded any more clues. Police found Monopoly money in the backpack, according to a law enforcement official who had been briefed on the investigation.</p><h2 id="link-2f293513">Why are the shell casings a crucial clue?</h2><p>The shooter may have left behind two revealing clues. Bullet casings found at the scene appear to have had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” on them, officials said.</p><p>Those words may have been a message related to “Delay, Deny, Defend,” the title of a book that discusses how health insurance companies avoid paying patients’ claims. The book, by Jay M. Feinman, a professor emeritus at Rutgers Law School, was published in 2010.</p><p>The discovery led the police to think the shooter may have been a former employee or client of UnitedHealthcare, or possibly a conspiracy theorist, the senior law enforcement official said.</p><p>Investigators were looking into the purchase in Connecticut of a gun that resembled the weapon used in the shooting, according to two officials briefed on the investigation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-10"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>UnitedHealthcare C.E.O.

The company, based in a Minneapolis suburb, is a unit of UnitedHealth Group, one of the country’s largest publicly traded companies, with a market valuation of $560 billion.</p><p>Mr. Thompson spent more than 20 years rising through the ranks at UnitedHealthcare, which offers insurance to companies and individuals, employs about 140,000 people and had $281 billion in revenue in 2023.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>He received total compensation of $10.2 million last year, with $1 million in base pay augmented by substantial cash and stock grants. The company’s profits rose on his watch, jumping to more than $16 billion last year from $12 billion in 2021.</p><p>But amid the growth, the company and its parent also attracted scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators who accused them of systematically refusing to authorize health care procedures and treatments.</p><p>UnitedHealth Group’s size and scope have attracted the attention of the Justice Department, which is examining whether the company has engaged in anticompetitive behavior.</p><p>According to regulatory filings, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/health/brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare.html" title="">Mr. Thompson owned about $20 million</a> of UnitedHealth Group shares as of late September. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-11/unitedhealth-unh-executives-sold-stock-before-us-probe-became-public" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg reported</a> in April that he was one of several company executives who sold shares before the Justice Department’s antitrust investigation was disclosed to investors — about $15 million worth, in Mr. Thompson’s case. The company told Bloomberg at the time that the sales had been approved.</p><p>Mr. Thompson lived in Maple Grove, Minn., where police responded to a bomb threat targeting his residence on Wednesday, about 12 hours after the shooting. A police report released Thursday said the small suburban department sought help from the Minneapolis bomb squad to search two residences. They found nothing. Mr. Thompson recently received several threats, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation. The source and precise nature of the threats was unclear.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>After Mr. Thompson’s death, a torrent of criticism was leveled against insurance companies over claim denials, in particular at UnitedHealthcare.</p><p>It was the subject of <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024.10.17-PSI-Majority-Staff-Report-on-Medicare-Advantage.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a scathing report</a> released by a Senate panel that documented insurers’ refusal to pay for the care of older people recovering from falls or strokes. The report was part of Senate investigations into denial rates of private Medicare Advantage plans. Mr. Thompson’s company, in particular, was cited for a surge in denials of post-acute care, which increased to 22.7 percent in 2022 from 10.9 percent in 2020.</p><p>Before joining UnitedHealthcare, Mr. Thompson spent nearly seven years at the accounting and consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, now known as PwC.</p><p>He graduated from the University of Iowa with an accounting degree in 1997.</p><h2 id="link-4035af26">Why was he in Manhattan?</h2><p>The shooting occurred as Mr. Thompson arrived early at the hotel to prepare for a UnitedHealthcare investors’ day gathering.</p><p>Such events, which are common for publicly traded companies, give major shareholders and analysts who track the companies a chance to hear from executives and to ask questions.</p><p>The New York Hilton Midtown, one of New York City’s largest hotels, is in a busy tourist area, close to the Museum of Modern Art and Rockefeller Center, where the famous Christmas tree was lit Wednesday night.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Reed Abelson<!-- -->, <!-- -->Chelsia Rose Marcius<!-- -->, <!-- -->William K.
