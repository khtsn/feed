But the parents of Conan O’Brien, 61, were not only celebrated in their respective fields but by the most well-known of their six children.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Conan O’Brien credited his father with introducing him to comedy and described him in <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/12/12/metro/dr-thomas-obrien-obituary-conan-obrien/?event=event12" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview this week</a> in The Boston Globe as “the funniest guy in the room.” He added that his father had a “voracious appetite for ideas and people and the crazy variety and irony of life.”</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Thomas F.

He also was a co-founder of the Collaborating Centre for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance for the World Health Organization. He became known for his work around antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</p><p>Ms. O’Brien<strong> </strong>was one of only four women in her law school class at Yale and, in 1978, became the second woman to be named partner at the Boston firm of Ropes &amp; Gray, where she was a real estate attorney.</p><p>Recalling when his mother made partner, Mr. O’Brien said, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnGREUPsjt4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a video about her career</a> in 2017, that it was “pretty emotional, pretty amazing.”</p><p>Over the years, when the comedian spoke of his parents on air, he often joked that they did not know what he was really up to — namely, writing sketch comedy and bawdy jokes for late-night television — but instead thought that he was in law school, or working in real estate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyDka0YvhVo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said recently</a> on his podcast, “Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend,” that his mother had hoped her children would be the kind welcomed at country clubs,<span>  </span>but instead she ended up with “Irish pirates.”</p><p>Despite the jokes, the couple appeared to be supportive of their son.</p><p>In 1993, when he was tapped to replace David Letterman on NBC’s “Late Night with David Letterman,” a huge break in his career, his mother told The Boston Globe, “To have him get this slot — well, it’s lovely, isn’t it? It really is lovely.”</p><p>She told The Boston Herald around the same time: “He seems to thrive on interaction with other people.”</p><p>Conan O’Brien — the third of the six children — grew up with busy, working parents.</p><p>Now common knowledge, so-called superbugs were a novel concept when the senior Mr. O’Brien traveled the world to raise awareness of the issue. He also helped to create databases to allow for a swift response to outbreaks of antibiotic resistance. He retired, at 90, in 2019.</p><p>Mr. O’Brien was remembered this week by colleagues, including in the medical publication NEJM Journal Watch, as an expert in antimicrobial resistance and <a href="https://blogs.jwatch.org/hiv-id-observations/index.php/dr-thomas-obrien-expert-in-antimicrobial-resistance-and-giant-in-his-field-literally/2024/12/12/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a giant in his field</a> — “literally.” He was about the same height as Conan O’Brien, who is 6 feet 4 inches.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The wedding announcement for Ruth Reardon and Francis N.

She was asked to come back to work in the early 1970s after running into a partner at Ropes &amp; Gray while out shopping for Father’s Day gifts, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnGREUPsjt4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she said in 2017</a>, and retired in 1996, about 25 years later.</p><p>The two were born to Irish Catholic families in Worcester, Mass., and <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1958/08/24/81864532.html?pageNumber=99" title="">were married in 1958</a>. In the video about Ms. O’Brien’s career, they speak of sharing child rearing duties like car-pooling to juggle raising a large family with their high-powered careers.</p><p>The couple is also survived by their other three sons, two daughters and nine grandchildren.</p><p>Conan O’Brien has spoken affectionately of his childhood home. “There were six kids, two dogs, a cat, my grandmother, a parakeet,” he said in the video about his mother, calling it “lovely madness, but madness still the same.”</p><p>He added, of his parents: “I don’t know how they worked it out, but they worked it out pretty well. We’re all here, we’re all alive. I don’t know how they did it.”</p><p>Michael Levenson<!-- --> and <!-- -->Kate Christobek<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
