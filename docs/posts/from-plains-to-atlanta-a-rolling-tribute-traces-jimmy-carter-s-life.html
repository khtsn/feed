It paused in front of the golden-domed State Capitol where Mr. Carter served as governor. From there, it moved on to the Carter Center, the nonprofit he and his wife, Rosalynn, founded, and that became the vehicle for efforts that defined his post-presidential legacy.</p><p>At many points along the route, standing on sidewalks and looking over the edges of highway overpasses, crowds assembled to pay their respects. Their reasons for coming were different. Some praised Mr. Carter as the greatest president in the nation’s history. Others said they admired his devotion to his faith and what they regarded as his strength of character.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Craig Long, a 66-year-old former Marine and retired roofer who came from Terre Haute, Ind., called his own politics “hard right.” But he said he felt a kinship with Mr. Carter because they shared humble roots. He said Mr. Carter also offered an example worth following. Just as Mr. Carter volunteered for Habitat for Humanity building houses, Mr. Long said he pitched in at a soup kitchen.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People watched the motorcade from an overpass along Interstate 75 through Forsyth, Ga.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Alex Brandon</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The motorcade carrying the remains of President Carter made a stop at the Georgia State Capitol.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Audra Melton for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I admire how much he loved people in general,” Mr. Long said. </p><p>The trip began at about 10 a.m. in Americus, Ga., after his remains were carried to the hearse by current and former special agents in charge of the Secret Service unit that protected Mr. Carter.</p><p>As the hearse and motorcade stopped at the sliver of country road running alongside the farmhouse outside Plains, bells were rung 39 times, a nod to his position in the lineup of American presidents.</p><p>Mr. Carter wrote books that lovingly recounted an upbringing at the house where he lived until he left for college. He milked cows, learned to cook possums (the taste: “unique”) and drew water from a well. He also described the fraught racial dynamics of the segregated South and the enduring strains from the Civil War.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The morning was crisp but cold.

Still, she was certain: “I love Jimmy Carter.”</p><p>She admired his ability to balance his Christian faith with secular leadership. She also said she believed that he “tried winning the heart of the whole country,” adding, “which we’re not seeing much of these days.”</p><p>Robert Garland, a retired Miami-Dade County sheriff’s deputy, was assigned to Mr. Carter’s security detail in 1991 when the former president visited Miami for his home-building work with Habitat for Humanity. “He led with dignity, honor and respect,” said Mr. Garland, 64, who traveled from Florida with his wife to watch the procession.</p><p>Once in Atlanta, the motorcade stopped at the Capitol and was greeted by city and state leaders, including Brian Kemp, Georgia’s Republican governor, and Andre Dickens, the Democratic mayor of Atlanta. Those gathered paused for a moment of silence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The coffin of President Carter at the Carter Center.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Craine for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A private service was held at the Carter Center.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Alex Brandon</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>After leaving the Capitol, the procession began a slow-motion tour through a slice of Atlanta, a place that wasn’t Mr. Carter’s hometown but where he nevertheless developed deep roots.</p><p>He cheered at Braves games. He would pop by Manuel’s Tavern, a bar that was a regular hangout for Georgia Democrats. And he worked countless hours at the Carter Center.</p><p>The day’s travels concluded there. A private service was held in the afternoon, and the former president was to be in repose at the center from Saturday evening until early Tuesday.</p><p>Denise Billingsley, 55, made a five-hour trip from Kentucky and said she planned to immediately turn around and head back to beat an expected ice storm. The repose would be the closest she has ever been to a president, she said, much less one she saw as “a great example of what our country should strive for.”</p><p>“He’s worth making the trip for,” added Eddie Turner, who accompanied Ms. Billingsley.</p><p>On Tuesday morning, the journey will continue toward Washington, where Mr. Carter will lie in state at the U.S. Capitol for a day and a half. A funeral is scheduled for Thursday morning at Washington National Cathedral, where President Biden is expected to deliver a eulogy. President-elect Donald J. Trump has indicated that he will attend.</p><p>But until then, Mr. Carter belonged to Georgia.</p><p>Along the route, there were messages of love, collections of flowers and American flags, even offerings of jars of peanuts. In one of the crowds, someone held up a sign: “Thank you sir, you were one of us.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emily Cochrane is a national reporter for The Times covering the American South, based in Nashville.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane">More about Emily Cochrane</a></span></p></div><div><p>Rick Rojas is the Atlanta bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the South.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/rick-rojas">More about Rick Rojas</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>11</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Final Respects Begin, From Georgia to Washington<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Life and Legacy of Jimmy Carter</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Carving a New Mold for Ex-Presidents</strong><strong>:</strong> Jimmy Carter redefined what a president can do <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/us/politics/jimmy-carter-post-presidency.html">after departing the White House</a>, leaving a lasting imprint through his work overseas, particularly in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/health/jimmy-carter-global-health.html">the realm of public health</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Relationship With Successors:</strong> Carter’s relationship with his fellow members of the exclusive club of presidents was generally tense because of his outspokenness. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/us/politics/jimmy-carter-successors.html">That never mattered to him</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Losing the South:</strong> After Carter’s ascension to the White House, he witnessed a shift from what had been a solidly Democratic South to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/us/jimmy-carter-democrats-republicans-south.html">one that Republicans came to dominate</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Habitat for Humanity:</strong> After Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, linked themselves to the group, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/us/jimmy-carter-habitat-for-humanity.html">it grew and built homes for millions</a>.
