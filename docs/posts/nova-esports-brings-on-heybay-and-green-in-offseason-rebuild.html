<p>CB started his career with Nova, and has primarily been an Initiator-first player for the team, but has also played the Duelist and Sentinel roles throughout different iterations of the team&#39;s ever-changing roster. The former CrossFire player made his professional debut with Nova in 2023, and was a teammate with o0o0o in his CrossFire days. o0o0o also joined Nova in 2023, and has since <a href="https://weibo.com/5111938150/Qd3pVnLfO" target="_blank">announced</a> his retirement from professional Valorant. o0o0o was in and out of Nova&#39;s starting lineup in 2025, shuffling between the Initiator and secondary Controller roles for the team. 24K, who has been Nova&#39;s head coach since the start of the 2024 season, had been with the organization since mid-2023, initially starting as a coach and transitioning into the head coach role in 2024.</p>
