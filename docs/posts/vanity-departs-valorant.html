		Malaspina</span> has <a href="https://x.com/Vanityxz/status/1853437224295055442" target="_blank">announced</a> that he is stepping away from Valorant.</p>

<p>The former in-game leader revealed that he was &#34;not finding any enjoyment in playing ranked with the environment it&#39;s developed into.&#34; He also shared that he would entertain the possibility of competing again &#34;if I feel that I&#39;m able to get to a level I&#39;m confident in.&#34;</p>

<p>vanity made his debut in 2021 with American Challengers team <span data-ref-id="2">

</span>, and joined Cloud9 for the first time ahead of the 2022 season.</p>

<p>Most well-known for his play on Controller agents like Omen, Astra, and Viper, vanity had two stints with Cloud9, the second of which took place this past season. With them this past year, he achieved a 5th-6th placed finish in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2095/champions-tour-2024-americas-stage-2/playoffs" target="_blank">Americas Stage 2</a>.</p>

<p>In his first go-around with the organization, which lasted from August 2021 to March 2023, he led the team to be the only North American team to reach the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/449/valorant-champions-2021/playoffs" target="_blank">Champions 2021</a> playoffs, where they were eliminated in the quarterfinals.</p>

<p>vanity was announced as a restricted free agent to begin the offseason, but parted ways with the organization soon after.</p>

<p>&#34;Thank you to everyone who has supported me, my teammates and every organization I&#39;ve been under you guys made it possible for me to pursue something I&#39;ve dreamed of my entire life and I hope to keep your support,&#34; he said.</p>

			<p>idk where you would look, he&#39;s been lurking around csgo tier 2 lately because he can&#39;t compete in valorant t1 skillwise, as for his toxicity, he&#39;s been known to leak scrims and cause problems in teams because he (allegedly) refused to adapt and change his playstyle, he has also waved and did the boo-hoo gesture to crying/frustrated players on the opposing team at every lan he&#39;s attended, you can see him tbag and shoot bodies in every single game, regardless of if he&#39;s winning or losing</p>
