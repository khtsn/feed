    <h1>France Suggests It Would Not Immediately Arrest Netanyahu Despite I.C.C. Warrant</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>France’s Foreign Ministry strongly suggested on Wednesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel would not immediately be arrested if he came to French territory, despite an International Criminal Court arrest warrant targeting him.</p><p>A member of the court, France has been cautious so far in its reaction to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/world/middleeast/icc-netanyahu-israel-gaza-war.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">arrest warrants</a><span>  </span>issued last week for Mr. Netanyahu and his former defense minister. It did not say outright that Mr. Netanyahu would be free to travel to France, but it argued that the court’s rules on immunity applied to him and would have to be considered by French authorities.</p><p>“France will comply with its international obligations,” the ministry said in a <a href="https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/israel-palestinian-territories/news/2024/article/israel-international-criminal-court-27-11-24" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>. But it added that while the Rome Statute — the 1998 treaty that established the court — demands “full cooperation” with the court, it also says that a state “cannot be required to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the immunities of states not party to the I.C.C.”</p><p>The ministry added, “Such immunities apply to Prime Minister Netanyahu and the other ministers concerned and will have to be taken into account should the I.C.C. request of us their arrest and surrender.”</p><p>The court’s warrant, which accuses Mr. Netanyahu of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Israel’s war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, immediately confronted governments around the world with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/world/middleeast/netanyahu-arrest-warrant.html" title="">a vexing question</a> of whether to detain the prime minister. Mr. Netanyahu is the first leader of a modern Western democracy to be accused of war crimes by the court and — unlike <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/world/middleeast/icc-war-crime-arrest-warrants-putin.html" title="">other leaders </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/asia/myanmar-junta-leader-rohingya.html" title="">targeted</a> by the court — he is a close ally of the United States and many other countries. </p><p>Some I.C.C. members, like Ireland, have taken a firm line on the arrest warrants, saying Mr. Netanyahu would be arrested on their soil. But others, like Italy, have also raised questions about the feasibility and legality of an arrest.</p><p>The court warrants have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-icc-warrant.html?searchResultPosition=1\" title="">drawn outrage in Israel</a>, where the authorities said on Wednesday that they would appeal them before the court and ask for a delay in their execution.</p><p>“Israel’s notice of appeal reveals in detail how far-fetched and without any factual or legal basis the decision to issue the arrest warrants was,” Mr. Netanyahu’s office said in a statement.</p><p>President Emmanuel Macron and Mr. Netanyahu <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/world/europe/macron-netanyahu-weapons.html?searchResultPosition=9" title="">have a strained relationship</a>, but France has played a key role in trying to keep the conflicts in the Middle East from spiraling out of control, especially in Lebanon. The French Foreign Ministry’s statement came a day after France and the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/world/middleeast/cease-fire-israel-hezbollah-lebanon.html" title="">helped broker a cease-fire</a> to stop the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.</p><p>France and Israel are “two democracies committed to the rule of law” that have a “longstanding friendship,” the French ministry said, adding that France would continue to work “in close cooperation” with Mr. Netanyahu and other Israeli authorities.</p><p>Some of Mr. Macron’s opponents criticized the ministry’s position and suggested it was politically motivated, with the aim of securing the cease-fire in Lebanon.</p><p>“France has once again bowed to Benjamin Netanyahu’s demands, choosing him over international justice,” Marine Tondelier, the leader of France’s Green party, <a href="https://x.com/marinetondelier/status/1861736436505911777" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on X</a>.</p><p>Jean-Noël Barrot, France’s foreign minister, <a href="https://www.francetvinfo.fr/replay-magazine/franceinfo/l-invite-politique/cessez-le-feu-entre-israel-et-le-hezbollah-la-france-va-veiller-a-la-creation-des-conditions-permettant-la-paix-durable-dans-la-region-promet-le-ministre-des-affaires-etrangeres_6882689.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Franceinfo</a> radio on Wednesday that “France is very attached to international justice” and that “France, as always, will apply international law.”</p><p>But Mr. Barrot did not directly answer when asked if Mr. Netanyahu would be arrested on French soil, and he also said that the Rome Statute provided “immunity for certain leaders.”</p><p>“The final decision rests with the judicial authorities,” he added, suggesting that Mr. Macron’s government would let French courts rule on the validity of the arrest warrant before potentially enforcing it.</p><p>French officials have not publicly laid out which parts of the court’s founding treaty were applicable to Mr. Netanyahu’s situation. The Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for clarification.</p><p>The scope of leaders’ immunity before international courts has long been a subject of intense debates, and there is still no consensus on the issue among scholars, judges or other authorities. But with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-jordan-ethnic-cleansing.html" title="">accusations</a> of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/24/world/africa/sudan-civil-war-atrocities-un.html" title="">atrocities</a> in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/05/22/world/europe/ukraine-war-crimes.html" title="">the wars</a> in Ukraine, Sudan and the Middle East in recent years, countries and activists have increasingly called for leaders to be held accountable under international criminal law.</p><p>Article 27 of the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/2024-05/Rome-Statute-eng.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rome Statute</a> says that it applies to all officials, including heads of state or government, and that “immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under national or international law, shall not bar the court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person.”</p><p>But Article 98 of the statute says that the court “may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance” that would require a state to “act inconsistently with its obligations under international law” relative to the diplomatic immunity of a person.</p><p>Some judges and prosecutors have argued that diplomatic immunity under that article is restricted and does not include large-scale crimes under international law.</p><p>France seemed to take a far firmer stance toward President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/17/world/europe/putin-icc-arrest-warrant-war-crimes.html" title="">the target of another arrest warrant</a> issued by the court. Russia, like Israel and the United States, is not a member of the court.</p><p>Commenting on Mr. Putin’s recent visit to Mongolia, which is also an I.C.C. member, the French foreign ministry has said that each member nation was obliged to cooperate with the court “and execute the arrest warrants it issues.”</p><p>But French authorities voiced full-throated support for the arrest warrant against Mr. Putin when it was issued last year, <a href="https://x.com/francediplo/status/1636788245894959104?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calling</a> it a “landmark” decision and adding that “no one responsible for crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine, whatever their status, should escape justice.&#34;</p><p>Philippe Dam, the European Union director for Human Rights Watch, <a href="https://x.com/philippe_dam/status/1861741115793092620" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on X</a> that the ministry’s statement about Mr. Netanyahu was “absurdly insane.”</p><p>“Does this also apply to Russia’s Putin?” he asked, adding that French officials were “weakening France’s commitments to justice and its credibility on the world stage.”</p><p>Several experts on international law said that as an I.C.C. member, France should not defy the court’s judgment simply because it disagreed with it. France would undermine the court if it were to ignore its obligations, said Stephen J. Rapp, a former U.S. ambassador and international prosecutor. </p><p>French courts could also come to their own conclusions, he added, noting that a French appeals court had recently found that President Bashar al-Assad of Syria — which is not a member of the I.C.C. — could be tried in France for the use of chemical weapons against Syrians in 2013. Prosecutors have <a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20240703-france-s-top-court-to-examine-arrest-warrant-for-syria-s-assad" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked France’s highest court</a> to review that ruling.</p><p>But some experts also said it appeared unlikely that Mr. Netanyahu would risk setting foot in France or other European nations. </p><p>“I don’t think any indicted officials will come to Europe anyway because of the risks,” said Emmanuel Altit, a French lawyer involved in international cases. “The legal issues around arrests are open to debate and nobody knows what sealed arrest warrants may exist.”</p><p>And even if the French government tried to reassure such officials, they may not feel confident that they could avoid detention, said William Schabas, a scholar of international law.</p><p> “The French justice system is independent and what it might do is unpredictable,” he said.</p><p>Ephrat Livni<!-- --> contributed reporting from Washington.</p></div></div>
