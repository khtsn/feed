    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p><time datetime="2024-10-09T01:16:01-04:00">Oct. 9, 2024</time></p><p>In Japan, same-sex unions remain outlawed, and children who don’t conform to traditional gender norms are routinely bullied. Japanese who are gay, transgender or nonbinary must stake out their own distinctive paths.</p><p>In these interviews, L.G.B.T.Q. Japanese — some of whom spoke despite fears of being ostracized — talked about their daily rhythms and routines. While some are politically active, others prefer to let their personal lives speak for their desire to be accepted.</p><h2 id="link-67709264">‘I thought they wouldn’t be able to understand even if I tried to tell them how much I loved my girlfriend.’</h2><p>When Hitomi Sawabe, 72, was in high school in Tokyo, she was told that homosexuality was akin to measles — something that could be cured.</p><p>Her affection for other women did not feel to her like an illness. Yet she was afraid to share with her family the true nature of her relationships.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In Japan at the time, public images of lesbians tended to show them in pornographic contexts. On a trip to the United States with her partner at the time, Ms. Sawabe discovered a community that “felt free of gender,” and she was inspired to write about her own sexuality back in Japan.</p><p>She published essays, a survey of women’s sexuality and a biography about a lesbian relationship between a well-known Japanese novelist and her lover. Ms. Sawabe herself had a 10-year relationship with a woman that collapsed when her partner grew weary of Ms. Sawabe’s intense devotion to her writing and decided to marry a man and have children.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/05/world/00japan-lgbtq-hitomi-08/00japan-lgbtq-hitomi-08-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/05/world/00japan-lgbtq-hitomi-08/00japan-lgbtq-hitomi-08-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/05/world/00japan-lgbtq-hitomi-08/00japan-lgbtq-hitomi-08-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A person stands in front of a large tombstone, holding flowers." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/05/world/00japan-lgbtq-hitomi-08/00japan-lgbtq-hitomi-08-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/05/world/00japan-lgbtq-hitomi-08/00japan-lgbtq-hitomi-08-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/05/world/00japan-lgbtq-hitomi-08/00japan-lgbtq-hitomi-08-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/05/world/00japan-lgbtq-hitomi-08/00japan-lgbtq-hitomi-08-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hitomi Sawabe visiting her former partner’s grave in Saitama Prefecture, where they once lived together.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-5"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Sawabe cooking at home in Tokyo.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Visiting friends in Ibaraki Prefecture.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>A decade of loneliness and depression followed. When Ms. Sawabe’s former partner was diagnosed with cancer, she visited her ex-lover shortly before she died but felt they had left many emotions unresolved.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Last year, a butterfly landed on Ms. Sawabe’s eyeglasses. It felt like a sign. “I feel like she forgave me,” Ms. Sawabe said. “And since then I have visited her grave every month.”</p><p>Ms. Sawabe still lives alone, but she has opened a performance space for lesbian artists and others to gather and share their stories. She cooks, swims and visits friends.</p><p>“I want my emotions to move in the happy direction,” she said. “Recently I realized I can control that.”</p><h2 id="link-7f3d9590">‘We don’t want to send the message to the younger generation that we’re people who have to hide ourselves.’</h2><p>One of Gen Suzuki’s earliest childhood memories is being told that he was so much like a boy that “you must have left your penis in your mother’s belly.”</p><p>Mr. Suzuki, now 50, did not know anybody who was transgender or gay, and at school, he was bullied for being a girl who behaved like a boy. It wasn’t until he was in his mid-20s, when he watched a popular television drama about a transgender boy, that he realized there might be others like him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Still, he repressed this growing awareness and married a man. After a decade, they divorced. Mr. Suzuki had his breasts surgically removed, began hormone therapy and changed his name to reflect his male identity.</p><p>He started taking classes from a bamboo craft master. He met Ryoko Kunii, the woman he now calls his wife, when she interviewed him for a magazine about his transgender identity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gen Suzuki making bamboo bags at his home in the mountains of Shizuoka Prefecture.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-12"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Suzuki receiving a testosterone injection.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>With his wife, Ryoko Kunii.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The couple could not officially marry because Mr. Suzuki’s government-issued family registry listed him as female. Instead, they signed a partnership oath. Now Mr. Suzuki lives deep in the mountains of Shizuoka Prefecture making custom bamboo bags, while Ms. Kunii lives separately with her mother and grandmother, whom she cares for. She visits Mr. Suzuki once a week.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In 2021, Mr. Suzuki filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law that required transgender people to undergo sterilization in order to legally change their gender identity. Last year, the Shizuoka Family Court decided in his favor; a Supreme Court ruling also delivered a similar decision for a different plaintiff. While Mr. Suzuki has now legally changed his identity to male, he and Ms. Kunii haven’t married yet because they feel conflicted about an institution still off-limits to same-sex couples in Japan.</p><p>“We want to celebrate and file our marriage registrations together with the same-sex couples,” he said.</p><h2 id="link-70492744">‘I want people to understand that we are trying to live seriously.’</h2><p>Anna Tomiyasu, the first known Japanese transgender wrestler to compete as a woman, wanted to be cool before she wanted to wrestle.</p><p>As a young child in the countryside in Miyagi Prefecture, northeast of Tokyo, she attended a professional women’s match and was captivated by how the winner overcame a much larger competitor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“I just wanted to be that kind of cool girl,” said Ms. Tomiyasu, now 25. “But I realized that I was not even a girl then.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Anna Tomiyasu wrestling as Veny in Yokohama.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-19"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Tomiyasu at home giving her stepfather a massage, with her mother watching.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Before performing in her women’s pro wrestling league.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>By her third year of high school in Yokohama, Japan’s second-largest city, Ms. Tomiyasu had been diagnosed with “sexual identity disorder,” a medical prerequisite for receiving gender-affirming care in Japan. She joined a women’s pro wrestling group.</p><p>At age 20, she had genital surgery. Still, Ms. Tomiyasu, who uses the stage name Veny, cannot yet afford all the surgical procedures that Japan still requires for a legal gender change.</p><p>She has avoided any direct political activism on behalf of transgender identity. “If I said I am trans, that might cause a burden for the pro wrestling world,” she said. “I have tried hard to make myself look like a woman so that people don’t look down on me.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-534cd19c">‘I wanted a place where I could be myself, a comfortable place for me.’</h2><p>Before Satoko Nagamura became a mother, she felt as if she had a hole in her heart, a sense of loneliness that she thought would never be relieved.</p><p>But after she and her female partner conceived a son through IVF, his joyful nature saved her. “There is no amount of love that I can’t give to this child,” she said.</p><p>Ms. Nagamura, 41, who runs two restaurants in a gay-friendly neighborhood in Tokyo, is lobbying against a proposal by lawmakers in Japan’s governing party to bar same-sex couples from obtaining fertility treatments.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-23"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/06/00vid-japan-lgbtq-Satoko-58289-cover/00vid-japan-lgbtq-Satoko-58289-cover-square640.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/06/00vid-japan-lgbtq-Satoko-58289-cover/00vid-japan-lgbtq-Satoko-58289-cover-square640.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/06/06/119412_1_00vid-japan-lgbtq-Satoko-58289_wg_mobile_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Satoko Nagamura, left, with her partner, Mamiko, and their son during dinner at home in Tokyo.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-24"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Nagamura and her son at a playdate with other mothers in same-sex relationships.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.

They held a wedding ceremony, in part to prove to their parents that they were more than “just friends.”</p><p>Yet Ms. Nagamura said she did not feel particularly romantic toward her partner. Their relationship is grounded in the love they have discovered through shared parenting.</p><p>“People might see us as romantic partners from the outside,” she said. “But in Japan, often when people have children they become family, not romantic partners.”</p><h2 id="link-34af4f00">‘I always liked standing out since I was a small child.’</h2><p>Growing up on the outskirts of Tokyo, Takahiro Masuzaki fashioned high-heeled shoes out of a pair of slippers and some Lego blocks. He stuffed balloons under his shirt to emulate breasts.</p><p>Perhaps it was a foregone conclusion that Mr. Masuzaki, 37, would end up performing as a member of a drag queen trio.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>That group, Happo Fu-Bijin, has become something of a fixture in the L.G.B.T.Q-friendly Nichome section of Shinjuku, in central Tokyo.

Later, as a business consultant, he would dress up as a woman and perform at company end-of-year parties.</p><p>Mr. Otake, who goes by Durian Lollobrigida onstage, also performed while working a corporate office job during the day. Cross-dressing does not always mean changing his gender: He often applies exaggerated makeup and wears brightly colored clothing as a man.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>“That’s the biggest attraction of being a drag queen,” he said. “I’d like to behave as antithetical to the world and society.”</p><p>Atsunobu Muramoto, 52, who performs as Esmeralda as the third member of Happo Fu-Bijin, said he wanted the audience to “receive love” through the group’s songs.</p><p>“It’s a message about living rather than a political message,” he said.</p><h2 id="link-67580f2d">‘People who directly put money and activism toward L.G.B.T.Q. activities are not viewed well in society.’</h2><p>Yota Kuki always wondered why girls were supposed to like pink and boys were supposed to like blue. “I thought within myself that was such a weird thing,” said Mx. Kuki, 36, an artist and street performer who identifies as nonbinary and uses “they” and them” pronouns.</p><p>Although Mx. Kuki still had a self-image as nonbinary, they had their breasts, ovaries and uterus surgically removed. Mx. Kuki hit a low point when a relationship with a man fell apart. Mx. Kuki thought of suicide.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-34"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yota Kuki taking a break after meeting with a fan of their art at a bookstore in Tokyo.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-36"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mx.

Kuki wandered into a bar and met a photographer who began taking portraits. Mx. Kuki noticed a kewpie doll that had fallen off a shelf. That began an artistic preoccupation with painting the dolls and incorporating them into outdoor performances.</p><p>The friends Mx. Kuki made at the bar provided a self-esteem boost. Mx. Kuki began making art in earnest and selling the painted kewpie dolls. Earlier this year, Mx. Kuki and some friends threw a surprise party for the photographer back in Ishigaki.</p><p>Mx. Kuki views the kewpie art as a way of communicating with people who might not yet accept gender diversity.</p><p>“My feeling is that if you suddenly say what you think to someone who is not ready for it, they won’t accept it,” they said. “And that is why I want them to look at my art and I think I can communicate my identity more smoothly that way.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><p>Kiuko Notoya and Hikari Hida contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Chang W.
