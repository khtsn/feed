Trump’s reasserting his plans for tariffs on a broad range of imported goods, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/business/trump-tariffs-us-trade.html" title="">which many economists said would be inflationary</a>. On Wednesday, the 10-yield briefly rose above 4.7 percent, hitting its highest level since April.</p><p>Inflation has recently proved <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/business/inflation-cpi-november.html" title="">stubborn</a>, a sign that the Federal Reserve has not yet won its battle against rapid price increases. Last year, the Fed began to cut interest rates from the decades-long highs they reached as officials tried to rein in stubborn inflation. The central bank cut rates three times last year, but it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/business/fed-meeting-interest-rates.html" title="">signaled only two reductions this year</a> as inflation lingers.</p><p>Mortgage rates have been climbing even as the Fed has cut the short-term rate it controls. That divergence is largely because longer-term rates set by the market, including mortgages, reflect investors’ expectations of future economic conditions, rather than the Fed’s current decisions.</p><p>Jitters about inflation and an “unsustainable” path of government borrowing have contributed to the surge in long-term interest rates, taking mortgage rates along for the ride, said Greg McBride, the chief financial analyst at Bankrate. He expects mortgage rates to end 2025 around 6.5 percent.</p><p>The housing market has been stuck for years, with mortgage rates rising rapidly in 2022 and 2023, peaking close to 8 percent. Many homeowners have felt trapped by the low rates they secured early in the pandemic, when the average 30-year rate was around 3 percent, making them reluctant to list their homes for sale. The lack of supply has kept prices high, making it even more of a challenge for buyers facing spiraling mortgage rates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Those looking to buy or sell might be forced to readjust to rates that remain stubbornly higher than they’d like. That shift in thinking is already underway, said Heather Mahmood-Corley, a real estate agent at Redfin in Phoenix. This week, one of her clients told her that she was prepared to buy a house within three to six months, no matter the borrowing costs — a sentiment that Ms. Mahmood-Corley said she had been hearing more often.</p><p>“A lot of people were waiting to see what happens with the new administration,” Ms. Mahmood-Corley said. “But I’ve also had a lot of buyers who are fine with these interest rates, and realized in 2025, they’re not going to go down like they’d hoped.”</p><p>More than just borrowing costs factor into whether and when to buy a house. Existing home sales climbed 4.8 percent in November, the latest data available, a sign that more buyers were jumping into the market. Solid growth in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/business/economy/november-jobs-report.html" title="">jobs and incomes</a> has helped support some activity.</p><p>Ultimately, “this is just not an environment where you can sit back and expect that mortgage rates are going to drop in a substantial way and ease affordability concerns,” said Mr. McBride of Bankrate.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/freddie-mac">Freddie Mac</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/business/mortgage-rates-housing.html">142</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/business/mortgage-rates-housing.html">142</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
