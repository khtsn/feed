    <h1>Southwest Layoffs Will Take 15% of Its Work Force</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In response, Mr. Jordan laid out a three-year plan to make sweeping changes, including dropping the airline’s seat-yourself policy in favor of assigned seating, adding seats with extra legroom and introducing red-eye flights — the first of which began last week — to make more use of its planes.</p><p>Southwest also agreed to add board members recommended by the investment firm, and Elliott ultimately dropped its demand for Mr. Jordan’s departure.</p><p>The job cuts announced on Monday will save Southwest about $210 million this calendar year and $300 million next year, the airline said. But those figures do not include a one-time cost of $60 million to $80 million to pay out severance and other benefits to laid-off workers.</p><p>Southwest had an unrivaled 47-year streak of annual profits until 2020, when it lost money along with the rest of the industry during the Covid pandemic. It has reported profits each year since and remains the only one of the four largest U.S. airlines to have never filed for bankruptcy protection, though its costs have outpaced those of some of its peers.</p><p>Still, the airline, which offers only limited international flights, is a behemoth: Southwest carries more passengers and operates more flights in the United States than any other carrier. The airline is also beloved by fliers, who have routinely given its economy class the highest customer satisfaction scores of any carrier, according to J.D. Power, a market research firm.</p></div></div>
