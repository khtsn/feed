But it has become a welcome haven for those who live an hour or more inland from the coast and pay hefty tolls to get there.</p><p>Like many cities, the fringes of Sydney’s urban sprawl are made up of working-class families, newly arrived immigrants and those pushed out further and further from downtown by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/world/australia/economy-cost-of-living.html" title="">rising housing prices</a>.

At just over half a mile long, it is as long as Bondi Beach.</p><p>On a recent Sunday, when a heat warning was in effect with highs of 95 degrees, children gleefully splashed about at Pondi with snorkels or pool floats in the shape of crocodiles and unicorns. Some families tossed about a rugby ball, while others cooked up a feast of prawns, sausages and a whole roast chicken. A couple of girls lay out on their stomachs for a tan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The beach has become a welcome haven for those who live an hour or more inland from the coast and pay tolls to get there.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Matthew Abbott for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Carroll, 46, a lifelong Penrith resident who works as an education coordinator in a nearby prison, has never had air conditioning at home. The previous night, she said, she drove around in her car just for the air conditioning, because it was too hot in her house.</p><p>Having a beach close to her home for her family to cool off, rather than having to spend a full day trekking out to the coast — paying steep prices for tolls, parking and food — has been a major help, particularly in a cost-of-living crisis she said has stretched her finances. By her accounting, that day’s outing would only cost her the gas for a 12-minute drive and a 50-cent McDonald’s ice cream for her daughter on their way home.</p><p>“A lot of people turn up their noses at it, but, mate, it’s free.

She liked it but said the saltiness of the ocean water left her with red splotches on her skin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“I like how soft the sand is.

The older two polished off hot dogs and a potato snack, and began pleading for ice cream. The youngest was in a swim diaper with the words “Fish are friends” on it.</p><p>A native of Darfur in landlocked western Sudan, Mr. Dahia said he only knows how to “donkey swim,” having grown up swimming in rivers that flooded after rain. He said that he arrived in Australia more than a decade ago as a refugee and that he has enrolled his children in swimming lessons for a true Australian upbringing.</p><p>They were late for swim class that day and decided instead to go to Pondi, which his neighbor had been raving about for weeks. Mr. Dahia, 38, said he was pleasantly surprised and said he’d probably be back before long.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A professional lifeguard watching swimmers at Pondi.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Matthew Abbott for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Diana Harvey said she was skeptical of Penrith Beach before she decided to check it out on a whim on a recent weekday afternoon.</p><p>She needed a break from her duties as a full-time caregiver for her autistic adult son, which keeps her at home most days, and hadn’t been to a beach all summer — a travesty for many Australians who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/world/australia/swimming-ocean-pool.html" title="">consider swimming a birthright</a>.</p><p>“I was basically brought up in the water,” said Ms. Harvey, 52, recalling that her family would spend three hours driving to and from a beach in the summers growing up. “We are all water people here.”</p><p>She had popped by Pondi in the waning days of summer thinking she would take a quick, 20-minute dip but ended up swimming for two hours, the Blue Mountains majestically stretching beyond and an expansive azure sky reflecting in the serene waters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Waiting for Pondi to open on a recent weekend.
