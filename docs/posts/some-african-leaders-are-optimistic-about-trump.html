Trump’s impending return to the White House has raised hopes among some African leaders, who expect it could lead to more investment, more trade deals and less lecturing on issues like democracy and human rights.</p><p>Until now, Mr. Trump’s most memorable pronouncements on Africa were to describe its countries with an expletive and to ban immigration from some of them.</p><p>Nevertheless, interviews with over a dozen current and former African and American officials, along with security analysts and business experts, reveal that, far from dreading Mr. Trump’s return, many African leaders are keen to engage him.</p><p>“I see a ray of light in this administration,” said Hilda Suka-Mafudze, the African Union ambassador to the United States, at a recent <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/events/2024/11/future-us-africa-relations-under-new-trump-administration?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">event</a> in Washington where African diplomats and experts questioned former officials from Mr. Trump’s first term about what the incoming administration might bring.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Experts say that Mr. Trump is expected to take a pragmatic and transactional approach to his dealings with Africa. Because of that, some African leaders now expect that his administration could bring their countries more profit from Africa’s wealth of natural resources, more healthy competition with China and other African partners and more jobs to help the world’s fastest-growing continent deal with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/10/28/world/africa/africa-youth-population.html" title="">a massive youth boom</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-3"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Trump has yet to outline any vision for Africa. In his first term, he threatened to slash aid budgets to Africa, and many experts have warned that his administration will pose great dangers to human rights, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/world/africa/rfk-jr-kennedy-international-work-public-health-policies.html" title="">public health</a>, humanitarian aid and the fight against climate change on the continent.</p><p>American influence in Africa has also slumped.</p><p>A <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/644222/loses-soft-power-edge-africa.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gallup poll</a> this year showed that China was the most popular power in Africa. The United States lost security access to parts of the jihadist-hit Sahel region amid a spate of coups. <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/07/22/africa-embassies-short-staffed-us-sahel-china-russia/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American embassies in Africa are understaffed</a>.</p><p>So some African leaders and analysts believe that a Trump administration could set a new direction.</p><h2 id="link-432e4273">Trade, Not Just Aid</h2><p>Mr. Trump is likely to loosen restrictions on the fossil fuel industry, creating opportunities for African oil and gas producers, said Zainab Usman, the director of the Africa program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. Although <a href="https://www.uneca.org/stories/17-out-of-the-20-countries-most-threatened-by-climate-change-are-in-africa%2C-but-there-are" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Africa is believed to be the continent most vulnerable to climate change</a>, many African leaders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/14/world/africa/oil-pipeline-uganda-tanzania.html" title="">want to exploit their resources</a> since their carbon footprint is minuscule relative to industrialized nations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>One way of increasing trade with Africa, many experts said, would be to renew, and expand, the African Growth and Opportunity Act — legislation that allows more than 30 African countries to export some products to the U.S. duty-free. The act, which has created hundreds of thousands of jobs, is set to expire next year. The African Union <a href="https://au.int/sites/default/files/pressreleases/43991-pr-Final_Read_out_for_AGOA_Ministers_-_24_July_2024_EN.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wants it</a> renewed for at least 16 years, but it is unclear whether the act will be a priority for an administration that has made increasing tariffs central.</p><p>South Africa’s automobile industry and Kenya’s clothing manufacturers could be some of the biggest losers if the act were not renewed, said David Omojomolo, an Africa economist at the research firm Capital Economics.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Delegates look at vehicles on display during the 20th African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kim Ludbrook/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The African Export-Import Bank, a Pan-African financial institution in Cairo, has <a href="https://efile.fara.gov/docs/7482-Informational-Materials-20241023-1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hired a lobby group</a> in Washington to help push for its renewal. The group’s leader said her team was already speaking with top officials and insiders in Mr. Trump’s orbit.</p><p>“They are going to have a transactional, enterprise-driven approach that puts America first,” said Rosa Whitaker, the former assistant U.S. trade representative for Africa for presidents Bill Clinton and George W.
