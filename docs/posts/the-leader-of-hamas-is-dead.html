    <h1>The Leader of Hamas Is Dead</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Yahya Sinwar, the Palestinian militant leader who orchestrated Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/17/world/israel-lebanon-iran-gaza-news" title="">was killed during a battle in Gaza</a>. The Israeli military said today that it confirmed his death using a sample of his DNA.</p><p>Sinwar, who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/middleeast/yahya-sinwar-dead.html" title="">known for his brutality and elusiveness</a>, had been the No. 1 target for Israel since the beginning of the war. He was believed to still be closely overseeing Hamas military operations, and Israel, along with the U.S., had dedicated vast resources to hunt him down. But in the end, a unit of trainee squad commanders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/middleeast/sinwar-israeli-intelligence.html" title="">unexpectedly encountered him while on an operation in southern Gaza</a>.</p><p>The Israeli soldiers, who were backed by drones, engaged in a firefight, bringing down part of a building and killing three Palestinian militants. When the dust settled, they retrieved a body that Israel later confirmed was Sinwar’s — a surprising place to find a man who was believed to be hiding out underground.</p><p>Sinwar was considered the driving force behind Hamas’s refusal to surrender. His death <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/middleeast/hamas-leader-sinwar-ceasefire-talks.html" title="">could unlock stalled truce talks, but major barriers still remain</a>. Sinwar’s hard-line brother, Muhammad, is believed to still be alive and to retain significant influence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Donald Trump at the Al Smith charity dinner in October 2016.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ruth Fremson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-6c9f8324">Trump will go to a charity event where he’s often been mocked</h2><p>Later tonight, Donald Trump is set to attend the Al Smith charity dinner in New York City, a high-powered event of the political and Roman Catholic elite that gives presidential candidates a chance to mock each other just weeks before the election.

Some Pentagon officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/us/politics/us-weapons-israel-ukraine.html" title="">worry that the flow of weapons could be hurting the U.S. military’s ability to respond</a> to a new conflict, particularly in the Pacific.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers last month called for clemency for Robert Roberson.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jordan Vonderhaar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-15ca626f">A Texas court delayed an execution in a shaken baby case</h2><p>Hours before the scheduled execution of Robert Roberson, a Texas man convicted of killing his 2-year-old daughter in 2002, a state court this evening ordered a temporary delay. Roberson’s conviction relied on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/us/texas-execution-robert-roberson.html" title="">diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome that has since been questioned</a>.</p><p>A Texas judge granted a temporary restraining order, which could delay the execution for at least another few days. The decision came after members of the Texas House argued that Roberson should be allowed to testify at a legislative hearing on Monday. A lawyer for the state attorney general suggested that the decision would be immediately appealed. </p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Caroline Tompkins for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-192031e">Mikey Madison becomes a star in ‘Anora’</h2><p>Once in awhile, a movie earns the cliché of a “star-making turn.” This year, our <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/movies/anora-review.html" title="">critic Alissa Wilkinson writes</a>, “Anora” deserves that title.
