    <h1>Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Donates $1 Million to Trump’s Inaugural Fund</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Zuckerberg is one of many tech chief executives who have worked to forge direct relationships with Mr. Trump. Even before last month’s election, Mr. Zuckerberg, Apple’s Tim Cook and Google’s Sundar Pichai started <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/technology/trump-tech-ceos.html" title="">reaching out to Mr. Trump</a>, sometimes flattering him and criticizing his opposition, as they aimed to put themselves in a position that could potentially benefit their businesses.</p><p>Mr. Trump previously had a strained relationship with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. He had accused the company of restricting him and other conservative voices across its apps. After the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/technology/facebook-trump-ban.html" title="">Meta had blocked Mr. Trump</a> on its platforms, though his accounts have since been reinstated.</p><p>Mr. Trump had also personally criticized Mr. Zuckerberg, once saying that the executive should be jailed in retaliation for “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/28/trump-zuckerberg-election-book-00176639" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plotting against</a>” him during the 2020 election.</p><p>But over the summer, Mr. Zuckerberg had at least two private phone calls with Mr. Trump. In one call, Mr. Zuckerberg wished Mr. Trump well and said he was “praying” for him after an assassination attempt this summer at a rally in Butler, Penn. In an interview at the time, Mr. Zuckerberg said Mr. Trump looked like a “badass” after being shot at the rally and pumping his fist to the crowd.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/PDFFiles/Mark-Zuckerberg-Letter-on-Govt-Censorship.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">letter to Congress</a> in August, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly expressed regret around some of his previous political activity. He said that in 2021, the Biden administration “pressured” Meta into censoring more Covid-19 content than he felt comfortable with. He added that would not repeat the contributions he made in 2020 to support electoral efforts because the gifts made him appear not “neutral.”</p></div></div>
