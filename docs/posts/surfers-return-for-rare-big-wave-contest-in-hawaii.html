On Sunday afternoon, the North Shore local was crowned the winner of the Eddie Aikau Big Wave Invitational. Mr. McNamara, a big wave surfer who was raised in a family of them, became the third consecutive North Shore surfer to win the iconic contest.</p><p>“I don’t know what to feel right now, I already cried ten times,” Mr. McNamara said as the sun began to set over the bay. In 2023, he lifted his best friend, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/23/sports/eddie-aikau-big-wave-invitational.html" title="">Luke Shepardson</a>, on his shoulders when he won the prestigious event. This year was his turn.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He won the contest in front of tens of thousands of spectators who crowded a small strip of beach and the surrounding cliffs. Many camped out as soon as the ubiquitous event was called. Kamehameha Highway, which hugs the bay, was clogged long before the sun came up. It is the only road to and from the bay.</p><p>Barry Sweet has long had a front seat to the mass of humanity at the event. Alongside his wife, Janelle, and her sister, Deann Sakuoka, he watches from the vantage point of Pupukea Grill, a food truck run by his family that is parked off the two-lane Kamehameha Highway, a 10-minute walk from Waimea Bay and one of the few restaurants within miles.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
