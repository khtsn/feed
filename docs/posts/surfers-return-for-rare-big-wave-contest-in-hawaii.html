On Sunday afternoon, the North Shore local was crowned the winner of the Eddie Aikau Big Wave Invitational. Mr. McNamara, a big wave surfer who was raised in a family of them, became the third consecutive North Shore surfer to win the iconic contest.</p><p>“I don’t know what to feel right now, I already cried ten times,” Mr. McNamara said as the sun began to set over the bay. In 2023, he lifted his best friend, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/23/sports/eddie-aikau-big-wave-invitational.html" title="">Luke Shepardson</a>, on his shoulders when he won the prestigious event. This year was his turn.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He won the contest in front of tens of thousands of spectators who crowded a small strip of beach and the surrounding cliffs. Many camped out as soon as the ubiquitous event is called. Kamehameha Highway, which hugs the bay, was clogged long before the sun came up. It is the only road to and from the bay.</p><p>Barry Sweet has long had a front seat to the mass of humanity at the event. Alongside his wife, Janelle, and her sister, Deann Sakuoka, he watches from the vantage point of Pupukea Grill, a food truck run by his family that is parked off the two-lane Kamehameha Highway, a 10-minute walk from Waimea Bay and one of the few restaurants within miles.</p><p>“If you watch from early morning until early afternoon, it’s like a pilgrimage,” he said of the crowds for the surf competition.</p><p>Like many big-wave competitions, the Eddie has a holding period that lasts for a few months, between mid-December and mid-March, meaning it could run at any point in that period if the conditions are right. But unlike most such events, the Eddie rarely happens, giving rise to the slogan “the bay calls the day.”</p><p>The face of the wave, the part of the wave that can be surfed, must reach heights of 40 feet, or the size of a four-story building. That’s unusual, and it’s rarer for those conditions to sustain a full day of competition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>This year’s conditions were created by a big storm that formed in the west Pacific Ocean, east of Japan, late on Thursday, said Kevin Wallis, director of forecasting at the surf forecasting website Surfline. It’s a Goldilocks-type scenario: If the storm had been too far away, the waves would have been too small. If the storm came too close, it could have brought bad wind and weather, he said.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-5"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Spectators gather at dawn before the start of the Eddie Aikau Big Wave Invitational, on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Marco Garcia/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Spectators watching waves break.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Marco Garcia/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The event was last held in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/23/sports/eddie-aikau-big-wave-invitational.html" title="">January 2023</a>, weeks after a false start sent dozens scrambling to the North Shore of Oahu before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/19/sports/eddie-aikau-big-wave-invitational.html" title="">the competition was canceled because of changing conditions</a>. In 2016, it was called off the morning of the event because of a swell change, and was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/sports/100000004236571/john-john-florence-wins-the-eddie.html" title="">eventually held weeks later</a>.</p><p>The big-wave surfer Felicity Palmateer decided to begin her long journey from Perth, Australia before the event was even called. She has long chased unpredictable swells but she didn’t want to risk missing this event.</p><p>“It’s so much more than a surf contest,” she said.</p><p>It’s a sentiment echoed by surfers, like Ms. Palmateer, who are stepping into their first Eddie, and by veterans of the event like Peter Mel, a big-wave surfer who will be surfing his ninth Eddie, a remarkable accomplishment considering this is only the 11th time the contest is running.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“It’s a celebration of not just surfing itself but of the culture, of life-saving, of watermen, and the heritage of Hawaii,” Mr. Mel said. “It’s almost like a Woodstock for surfing,” he added.</p><p>The event was founded in 1984 to honor Eddie Aikau, a surfer from Hawaii and the first lifeguard on the North Shore of Oahu. He was revered as a surfer who would paddle into waves no one else would attempt, and he saved more than 500 people as a lifeguard.</p><p>In 1978, Mr. Aikau joined the crew of a canoe voyage retracing the ancient Polynesian migration route between Hawaii and Tahiti. The vessel, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/17/us/ben-finney-dead-hawaii-tahiti.html" title="">Hokulea</a>, capsized off the coast of Lanai hours after setting sail. Mr. Aikau took his surfboard and paddled toward shore to get help. The rest of the crew was rescued, but Mr. Aikau was never seen again.</p><p>Being invited to the event is a sign of respect and recognition from the Aikau family, and for many big wave surfers, it’s the pinnacle of their careers. Even if the event doesn’t run, an Aikau nod is equivalent to a trip to the Super Bowl.</p><p>Surfers charge huge waves hoping to be recognized and added to the list of honorees.</p><p>In 2023, the big-wave surfer Jojo Roper was on the North Shore of Oahu when the event was set to run. He wasn’t invited to compete, he said, but “my goal was to catch a wave before the contest. If you get a good wave before the contest, your name sparks a bit better.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>It was impossible to get to Waimea Bay by car, so he and a friend hopped on a jet ski in the dark at Sunset Beach, about three miles away, and drove around the outer reefs to the bay.</p><p>That morning, he dropped into a massive wave. The crowds on the cliff erupted.</p><p>Mr. Roper was invited to compete this year.</p><p>“I just hope I can control the emotions a little bit because it’s a lifetime goal,” he said on Saturday afternoon.</p><p>Just after 8 a.m. in Hawaii, the contest’s director, Liam McNamara, made the final call on a jam-packed beach. The event would run.</p><p>“The bay has made the call,” Mr. McNamara said.</p><p>Competing surfers included the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/25/magazine/olympics-surfing-teahupoo-french-polynesia.html" title="">Olympic surfing</a> gold medalist Kauli Vaast; six previous Eddie winners, including John John Florence, Kelly Slater and Bruce Irons; and the defending champion, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/23/sports/eddie-aikau-big-wave-invitational.html" title="">Mr. Shepardson</a>, a North Shore lifeguard who defeated world champion surfers to win the event in 2023.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Several North Shore legends, including Moana Jones Wong, Makua Rothman, Makani Adric, Jamie O’Brien and Mason Ho, also competed.</p><p>This year, Ha’a Aikau, Eddie Aikau’s nephew, surfed in the event for the first time. He is the third member of the Aikau family to compete. Clyde Aikau, Eddie’s brother, last surfed the event in 2016, at 66 years old.</p><p>Each surfer competed in two heats and can surf a maximum of four waves per heat. Waves were scored by five judges on a scale of 1 to 20.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Makua Rothman, a competitor, waves to the crowd.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Marco Garcia/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>But, surfers said, the waves at Waimea seem to choose you.
