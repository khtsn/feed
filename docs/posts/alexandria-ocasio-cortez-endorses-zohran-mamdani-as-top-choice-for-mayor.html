Andrew M. Cuomo’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/nyregion/cuomo-resignation-governor.html" title="">path back to power</a>.</p><p>“Assemblymember Mamdani has demonstrated a real ability on the ground to put together a coalition of working-class New Yorkers that is strongest to lead the pack,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. “In the final stretch of the race, we need to get very real about that.”</p><p>Time is of the essence. With just weeks left before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/nyc-mayor-race" title="">the June 24 Democratic primary</a>, Mr. Cuomo has maintained a steady polling lead, stirring memories of 2021, when progressives did not coalesce and lost the mayoralty to a moderate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In elevating the assemblyman, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 35, chose the candidate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/nyregion/mamdani-record-albany-mayor.html" title="">closest to her own mold</a>. Mr. Mamdani, 33, is a leftist representing Queens, a millennial and a person of color who entered the race as a long shot only to jump to second place by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-mayor.html" title="">igniting grass-roots support</a> with memorable policy proposals and viral videos.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/nyregion/grocery-stores-city-owned.html" title="">His platform</a> echoes the congresswoman’s and has inspired pushback from more moderate Democrats. He wants to make city buses free, freeze rent increases on rent-stabilized apartments and open city-run grocery stores — all funded by a $10 billion tax hike on businesses and the superrich. He has also been a sharp critic of Israel.</p><p>But Ms. Ocasio-Cortez stressed that to defeat Mr. Cuomo, a moderate who she said “belongs to the hedge funds” and other wealthy interests <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/01/nyregion/cuomo-donors-mayor.html" title="">funding his campaign</a>, the left would have to build a bigger tent and urgently begin working more collaboratively.</p><p>To that end, the congresswoman said she would rank <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/nyregion/adrienne-adams-interview-mayor.html" title="">Adrienne Adams</a> second, citing her record as City Council speaker and Ms. Adams’s “genuine inroads and connections” in working-class Black and brown communities like the ones Ms. Ocasio-Cortez represents in the Bronx and Queens.</p><p>She plans to rank <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/nyregion/brad-lander-mayor-nyc.html" title="">Brad Lander</a>, the city comptroller, third, followed by Scott Stringer, a former comptroller, and Zellnor Myrie, a state senator from Brooklyn. Several of the candidates hold positions to the congresswoman’s right.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Even if the entire left coalesced around any one candidate, an ideological coalition is still insufficient for us to win,” the congresswoman said. “We have to have a true working-class coalition.”</p><p>The intervention has the potential to shape the race’s final stretch, given Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s stature among liberal advocacy groups and among the candidates themselves, as well as her growing popularity among more traditional Democrats.</p><p>But it remains far from clear whether it will be enough either to unite progressives or actually push Mr. Mamdani to victory. He has already maxed out campaign fund-raising limits and saturated support among the young and very liberal voters most closely associated with the congresswoman.</p><p>Her endorsement may further motivate supporters of Mr. Cuomo, who frequently blames the congresswoman and other members of his party’s left wing for alienating middle-of-the-road voters. Mr. Cuomo has secured most major <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/nyregion/cuomo-endorsed-unions-32bj-hotels.html" title="">labor union endorsements</a> and has the support of congressmen from Queens, Harlem and the Bronx.</p><p>Ms. Ocasio-Cortez indicated that no immediate joint appearances were scheduled.</p><p>Her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/05/nyregion/aoc-maya-wiley-endorsement-nyc-mayor.html" title="">2021 mayoral endorsement</a>, almost exactly four years ago, helped give Maya D. Wiley, another progressive, some late momentum, but she still lost. Since then, strategists on the left have lamented that they failed to follow a cohesive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/06/nyregion/nyc-mayoral-election-2025-ranked-choice-voting.html" title="">ranked-choice strategy</a>, allowing Eric Adams, a moderate former police officer, to narrowly claim victory. (Mr. Adams is running for re-election as an independent.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>This time, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s ranked slate mostly aligns with that of the Working Families Party, a bulwark of the left. The party has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/29/nyregion/wfp-endorsement-mayor-nyc.html" title="">urged its supporters</a> to rank five candidates on their ballot: Mr. Mamdani, Mr. Lander, Ms. Adams, Mr. Myrie and State Senator Jessica Ramos of Queens, in that order. (Ms. Adams picked up <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/05/yvette-clarke-adrienne-adams-new-york-city-mayor-00387455" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a second congressional nod</a> on Thursday from Representative Yvette Clarke of Brooklyn.)</p><p>Mr. Mamdani found out he had secured the endorsement, among the most coveted in New York politics, late Wednesday after he walked off the stage following the contest’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/nyregion/nyc-mayoral-debate-takeaways.html" title="">first televised debate</a>.</p><p>In a statement, he called Ms. Ocasio-Cortez a “once-in-a-generation leader” and said they shared a commitment to helping working people and opposing President Trump.</p><p>“In 2018, A.O.C. shocked the world and changed our politics for the better with her historic victory,” he said. “On June 24, we will do the same.”</p><p>Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her aides spent weeks studying the race. They asked candidates to submit polling, and opposition and strategy memos, to make the case for their viability. She has faced criticism for not weighing in sooner, but a person familiar with her thinking said she had long planned for her announcement to coincide with the final weeks of the race, when many voters are just tuning in.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Her decision to rank Mr. Mamdani first will be a particular disappointment to Mr. Lander, who has assiduously courted the congresswoman for years and entered the race as the progressive favorite. Mr. Lander, like Ms. Adams, has a prominent citywide leadership position and potentially broad appeal, but they both have struggled to generate the kind of excitement Mr. Mamdani has.</p><p>Though neither candidate has openly attacked Mr. Mamdani, they have privately made the case that he has unique weaknesses that could limit his support and help elect Mr. Cuomo, who resigned as governor in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations (which he denies) but still has a reservoir of support with many voters.</p><p>Mr. Mamdani, for example, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/nyregion/israel-gaza-antisemitism-mayor-nyc.html" title="">alienated parts of the city’s large Jewish community</a> with his outspoken support for the Palestinian cause and accusations that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.</p><p>As other candidates call for increasing the size of the city’s police force, Mr. Mamdani once endorsed calls to “defund the police” and has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-crime-plan.html" title="">proposed</a> funding more “violence interruption” and mental health services instead of traditional law enforcement. Other Democrats are scared away by the socialist label he embraces, and by his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/nyregion/mamdani-record-albany-mayor.html" title="">lack of experience</a>.</p><p>Ms. Ocasio-Cortez conceded that Mr. Mamdani had work to do cutting into Mr. Cuomo’s support among Black and Latino New Yorkers. But she said he had built an unparalleled field operation that had engaged voters across the city, including in areas of her district in the Bronx that are often overlooked by the left.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Trust can’t be built quickly,” she said.</p><p>Ms. Ocasio-Cortez also indicated that she was sensitive to concerns about Mr. Mamdani’s age and inexperience. She said she had “made my expectations of the assemblymember quite clear” about the kind of expertise and support he would need to succeed, if elected.</p><p>“As someone who got elected when I was 28 years old, I know very intimately what it means to be trusted with an enormous job of immense responsibility at a very young age,” she said. “It is not something that I take lightly.”</p><p>The congresswoman’s ranked-choice ballot is almost certain to be carefully dissected in New York and Washington as she weighs her own political future.</p><p>Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has only grown in national stature since President Trump’s return to power. She and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another left-wing standard-bearer, embarked on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/bernie-sanders-aoc-trump-democrats.html" title="">“Fighting Oligarchy” tour</a> this year that filled stadiums across the United States as Democrats searched for a path forward.</p><p>Party strategists have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/us/politics/aoc-sanders-democrats-2028.html" title="">openly speculated</a> about whether she will run for president in 2028 or seek the seat held by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicholas Fandos is a Times reporter covering New York politics and government.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on the N.Y.C.
