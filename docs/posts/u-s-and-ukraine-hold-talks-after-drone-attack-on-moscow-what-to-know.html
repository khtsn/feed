At least three people were killed and 18 others were injured in the Moscow region, the Russian authorities said. Ukraine’s military said it had targeted Moscow’s oil refinery, along with an oil production station in the Orel region. Neither claim could be independently verified.</p><p>Kyiv has long maintained that the only way to force Russia to accept an enduring peace deal is through force and by raising the cost of the war for the Kremlin. The timing of the overnight attack on Moscow was meant to drive home that message, Andriy Kovalenko, a senior Ukrainian official focused on Russian disinformation operations, said in a statement.</p><p>Russia has also continued its relentless bombardment of Ukrainian civilian and military institutions, regularly launching more than 100 drones each night.</p><p>On Tuesday morning, Ukraine’s Air Force said that Russia had launched 126 drones and one ballistic missile overnight. At least one person was killed when a Russian drone struck a warehouse in Kharkiv and at least 17 others were injured in attacks elsewhere in the country, the Ukrainian authorities said.</p><h2 id="link-1a7310c">State of the war</h2><p>Russian forces have long held the initiative on the battlefield in Ukraine.

That plan, supported by European nations, including France, is envisioned as a first step in building trust ahead of talks about the overall conflict — and the Ukrainian delegation is expected to raise the proposal again in the Jeddah meetings.</p><p>Ukraine is also more broadly seeking a resumption of American military aid and intelligence sharing that was suspended after the Oval Office debacle. The intelligence cutoff has already impaired soldiers in combat, according to Ukrainian commanders in the field.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-405b9c1">Potential concessions</h2><p>While European allies have pledged further support to Kyiv, Ukraine is seen as having few options for reversing Russia’s recent gains on the battlefield.</p><p>On the flight to Jeddah, Mr. Rubio <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/rubio-ukraine-russia.html" title="">said Ukraine would have to make concessions over land</a> that Russia had taken since 2014 as part of any agreement to end the war.
