And Ms. Ryan is among those who have adjusted their routines accordingly.</p><p>“I’ve changed everything,” Ms. Ryan, 61, said on Wednesday morning as she visited a playground with her two grown daughters and three grandchildren. “I don’t go out on my patio after dark. I’ve stopped gardening. I will be obeying the rules until further notice.”</p><p>Plymouth’s parks, swimming ponds and playgrounds still thrummed with life on Wednesday. But Ms. Ryan was hardly the only resident who said she had begun taking precautions and heeding the advice of public health officials to stay indoors from dusk until dawn, when mosquitoes are most active.</p><p>The virus cannot be passed from person to person. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/us/massachusetts-eee-mosquito-disease.html" title="">Most people who are bitten by an infected mosquito never even become ill.</a> But for the few who do, the virus can be very serious, leading to brain inflammation, neurological damage, coma or death. There is no treatment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Between 2003 and 2023, Massachusetts reported a total of 41 human cases of the virus, more than any other state. Michigan and Florida, with 22 and 24 cases, ranked second and third, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.</p><p>Southeastern Massachusetts, in particular, has seen its share of severe cases over the years; an outbreak there in 1938 killed 25 people, most of them children. More recently, in August 2006, a 9-year-old boy in Middleborough, Mass., <a href="https://www.southcoasttoday.com/story/news/2006/09/01/eee-takes-life-9-year/50432830007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">died of the virus</a>, falling into a coma one day after coming down with a headache and a fever.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sue Ryan, left, with her grandchildren and daughter at the Forges Field playground in Plymouth on Wednesday. “I don’t go out on my patio after dark.

Derek Ashworth is the rare exception. Infected with the virus during the same Massachusetts outbreak that killed the 9-year-old in 2006, Mr. Ashworth, then 23, was stricken by seizures, then fell into a coma for six days. Now 41, he recovered with no permanent damage.</p><p>In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Ashworth, of Rochester, Mass., said he takes reasonable precautions when outdoors and is vigilant about protecting his three young sons, but tries to raise awareness without instilling fear.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“This is nature, it’s the way it is, and we have to adapt and learn to live with it,” he said. “I wouldn’t say cancel your plans, but be aware it’s out there.”</p><p>Like others interviewed, Mr. Ashworth said he has mixed feelings about the aerial spraying of pesticide that began in Plymouth and other high-risk communities this week. Some said they were more concerned about the spraying than about the threat of the virus.</p><p>Holly Crocker, 46, of Plymouth, said she felt unnerved on Tuesday evening when she and her friend spotted a low-flying plane. “We don’t want to breathe it in,” she said.</p><p>Others have bristled at the town’s decision to close parks and playing fields at dusk to discourage outdoor activities at night, saying the closures were uncomfortably reminiscent of government lockdowns and mask rules during the coronavirus pandemic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“The main thing is, we haven’t even seen a case in Plymouth,” said Mike Pimental, 68, who grew up in the town but now spends part of the year in Florida. “And even if you get a case, it’s not a death sentence if a mosquito bites you.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mike Pimental and his dog Cleo, at Morton Park in Plymouth on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kylie Cooper for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>An announcement that high school football games in Plymouth would be moved to afternoons or weekends prompted pushback, including <a href="https://www.change.org/p/reinstate-night-football-games-at-plymouth-north-and-south-high-schools" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an online petition</a> calling on the town to keep Friday night games on the schedule.</p><p>Kelsey Kincade, a school athletic director in neighboring Carver, said students there have been understanding of the schedule changes, an adaptability she attributed to their experience in the pandemic, when school sports were largely canceled.</p><p>“They’ve been through a lot the last few years,” she said, “and they understand the need to be flexible, and that the important thing is that they can keep playing.”</p><p>To Mr. Pimental, though, the field closures and curfew recommendations are “a little reminder,” he said, standing beneath the tall pines at Morton Park in Plymouth, “that the government sometimes reaches a little too far.”</p><p>Even so, he acknowledged that he had pulled on a coat when he went out to walk his dog the previous evening. All the talk of risk, he said, had “put it in my mind.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jenna Russell is the lead reporter covering New England for The Times.
