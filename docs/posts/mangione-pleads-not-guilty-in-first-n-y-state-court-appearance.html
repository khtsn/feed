He faces the possibility of life in prison without parole.</p><p>Prosecutors said in court filings last week that Mr. Mangione’s actions were meant to further terrorism and were “intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population” and to “affect the conduct of a unit of government by murder.”</p><p>Mr. Mangione also faces federal charges: The Southern District of New York <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/nyregion/luigi-mangione-federal-charges.html" title="">charged him</a> with murder through use of a firearm, which carries a maximum potential sentence of death, as well as two stalking counts and a firearms offense. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges as well.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/nyregion/luigi-mangione-charges-what-to-know.html" title="">state case is expected to go to trial</a> before the federal one, said Edward Y. Kim, the acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District, and state prosecutors said they would coordinate with federal agencies.</p><p>Mr. Mangione entered the courtroom for his arraignment on Monday wearing a maroon sweater and light-colored pants. His wrists and ankles were shackled. During the hearing, his lawyer, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, told the judge she was concerned about her client’s right to a fair trial. “His rights are being violated,” she said.</p><p>“He’s a young man, and he is being treated like a human ping pong ball,” she said, pointing to the federal and state cases and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/nyregion/luigi-mangione-charges-what-to-know.html" title="">their differing arguments</a>.</p><p>She also described Mr. Mangione’s perp walk after he was extradited to New York last week, during <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/nyregion/luigi-mangione-eric-adams.html" title="">which he was accompanied by Mayor Eric Adams</a>, as “unnecessary” and “utterly political.”</p><p>She suggested that Mr. Adams, who faces bribery and fraud charges, had taken part in hopes of distracting from his own case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“What was the New York City mayor doing at this press conference,” she asked, adding that Mr. Adams “should know more than anyone about the presumption of innocence.”</p><p>The killing of the chief executive, Brian Thompson, renewed a debate about the American health care system. Many took to social media to voice their frustrations in their dealings with insurance companies and their practices of denying claims. Mr. Mangione <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/nyregion/uhc-shooting-luigi-mangione-brian-thompson.html" title="">became, to some, a folk hero</a>.</p><p>On Monday, about a dozen spectators, mostly young women, were waiting in line just after 6 a.m. in 11-degree weather, hoping to get into the courtroom for the arraignment. Across the street, camera crews set up their lights and other equipment. One person held a cardboard sign with the words “Deny, Defend, Depose.” Another held a sign that read “United States Healthcare Stole My Livelihood.”</p><p>Mr. Thompson was walking to the entrance of a Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan on the morning of Dec. 4 for an investor meeting when a masked and hooded gunman opened fire behind him. He was shot once in the back and once in the leg.</p><p>The authorities have said it was Mr. Mangione who waited nearly an hour outside the hotel that morning and raised a 3-D-printed 9-milimeter handgun fitted with a suppressor and fired at Mr. Thompson.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Mangione was arrested after a five-day manhunt. He was spotted eating hash browns at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pa., by a fellow customer who remarked to a friend that he looked like the person in photos that had been released by the New York Police Department. An employee overheard the conversation and alerted the police.</p><p>He was found with a handgun, ammunition and a fake identification card, as well as a 262-word handwritten manifesto in which he appeared to take responsibility for the shooting. The manifesto also indicated that he saw the killing as a direct challenge to the health care industry’s “corruption” and “power games.”</p><p>Mr. Mangione also faces five charges in Pennsylvania, including carrying a gun without a license, forgery, falsely identifying himself to the authorities and possessing “instruments of crime,” according to a criminal complaint.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
