It is the latest in a string of legal penalties for the global consulting firm, which in recent years has agreed to pay about $1 billion in settlements for its work with opioid manufacturers.</p><p>The fine announced Thursday was part of a deferred prosecution agreement that would dismiss the bribery charge against the company after three years if McKinsey meets the conditions of the deal. Separately, a former McKinsey senior partner, Vikas Sagar, who was a leader in its Johannesburg office, pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate an anti-corruption law, prosecutors said.</p><p>The bribery investigation stemmed from work that McKinsey’s South African branch performed, starting more than a decade ago, for two state-owned companies: one overseeing the country’s run-down electric generating system, the other managing its freight rail system and ports. Mr. Sagar received confidential information about the companies that led to multimillion-dollar consulting contracts, and in return, some of the money McKinsey and its local partners made was routed to two officials as bribes, prosecutors said.</p><p>“McKinsey Africa participated in a yearslong scheme to bribe government officials in South Africa and unlawfully obtained a series of highly lucrative consulting engagements” that netted McKinsey $85 million in profits, Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>When The New York Times published a 2018 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/world/africa/mckinsey-south-africa-eskom.html" title="">investigation</a> into McKinsey’s contracts in South Africa, the firm’s questionable work there was considered its biggest mistake in its nearly 100-year history. But the next year, with the United States in the grip of an opioid epidemic, McKinsey’s extensive work to “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/business/mckinsey-opioids-settlement.html" title="">turbocharge</a>” sales at Purdue Pharma, the maker of the painkiller OxyContin, became public.

Despite McKinsey’s extensive consulting for Eskom, the country has been crippled by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/world/africa/south-africa-power-energy-crisis.html" title="">frequent blackouts</a> in recent years.</p><p>South African law required McKinsey to hire local subcontractors, which have been the focus of criminal investigations in that country.</p><p>In 2018 McKinsey’s managing partner <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/business/mckinsey-ends-ice-contract.html" title="">apologized</a> for the way the firm had handled the controversy over its work in South Africa, which came amid a corruption scandal that led the country’s president to resign. McKinsey voluntarily returned about $100 million and fired Mr. Sagar.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At the time McKinsey was working with Transnet, Mr. Sagar arranged for a former McKinsey employee to ghostwrite an M.B.A. thesis for a senior Transnet executive, according to the former employee.</p><p>“McKinsey is deeply remorseful that an employee of our firm engaged in corrupt conduct,” the firm <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/za/our-work/statements/mckinsey-statement-december-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a statement on Thursday, adding that it “will continue to cooperate” with South African and U.S. authorities in other ongoing investigations.</p><p>Mr. Sagar, a native of India and a graduate of the University of Michigan and the Wharton School, was responsible for winning some of the biggest contracts in McKinsey’s South African office. Known for his showy, larger-than-life personality, Mr. Sagar drove a Porsche, carried a Louis Vuitton briefcase and once ended a long business meeting by dancing on top of a conference table.</p><p>According to the documents unsealed Thursday, Mr. Sagar, 56, pleaded guilty in December 2022 to conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The announcement did not say whether he had been sentenced.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Forsythe a reporter on the investigations team at The Times, based in New York.
