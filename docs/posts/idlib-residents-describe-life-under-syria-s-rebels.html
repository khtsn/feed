    <h1>Idlib Residents Describe Life Under Syria’s Rebels</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>On the second floor of the Shababeek cafe, overlooking the clock tower square in the city of Idlib, the side reserved for men was empty except for two young men nursing cups of Turkish coffee. The family side, where women are allowed, was nearly full.</p><p>There was no music — just the hiss of an espresso machine and the clinking of cups — and unlike cafes elsewhere in Syria, the air was clear of hookah smoke. That is because of an agreement the owner had to sign with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Islamist group that has ruled for years in much of Idlib Province, in northwestern Syria, and which now controls most of the country with other rebel factions.</p><p>“Hookahs and music were banned from the beginning,” said Yahia Naeme, the owner of the cafe, who said the ban had lost him business because many people used to come to his cafe specifically to smoke hookahs. “If we can’t offer it, they’ll get bored and go elsewhere,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Other cafes in Idlib have skirted the law by offering hookahs in speakeasy-type environments behind closed doors. But Mr. Naeme did not want to risk running afoul of the area’s rulers.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/16/multimedia/16syria-idlib-01-zcwf/16syria-idlib-01-zcwf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/16/multimedia/16syria-idlib-01-zcwf/16syria-idlib-01-zcwf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/16/multimedia/16syria-idlib-01-zcwf/16syria-idlib-01-zcwf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="People sitting next to a window in a cafe." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/16/multimedia/16syria-idlib-01-zcwf/16syria-idlib-01-zcwf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/16/multimedia/16syria-idlib-01-zcwf/16syria-idlib-01-zcwf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/16/multimedia/16syria-idlib-01-zcwf/16syria-idlib-01-zcwf-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/16/multimedia/16syria-idlib-01-zcwf/16syria-idlib-01-zcwf-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/2f4d59f3-e5a2-5054-8fb7-787fbdb943a3" decoding="async" width="600" height="450"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A rebel fighter with two women in the family section of the Shababeek cafe in Idlib.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Friday Prayer in the former frontline town of Taftanaz in Idlib Province.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The bans on hookahs and music at cafes were part of a few religious laws initially imposed on Idlib by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham when it took power there in 2017, which also included attempts to impose a stricter dress code for women and a ban on the sale and purchase of alcohol.</p><p>The group has ruled Idlib with an authoritarian hand, imprisoning and torturing some critics, according to residents and human rights groups. But even those who chafe under its rule say that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has been pragmatic and shown flexibility.</p><p>The group has brought order to a devastated region, and reversed some laws after a backlash from residents. Early on, for instance, a morality police patrolled streets and government buildings, but that practice was later ended.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It also did not adopt the brutal methods of extremist groups like the Islamic State, which sometimes punished people with public executions, instead imposing mainly fines for people breaking laws.</p><p>The group has also been desperate to shed its image as a group once affiliated with Al Qaeda. Despite that and attempts to gain international legitimacy, the group is still designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.</p><p>In Idlib, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has sought to win over hearts and minds and prove its governing credentials by undertaking public works. It has paved roads, provided regular running water and electricity and repaired war damage — things that are lacking in the rest of Syria.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Men in Idlib on Saturday repairing residential buildings and a kindergarten that were damaged in recent airstrikes.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A mural in Idlib painted earlier this year commemorating 13 years of resistance to the Assad government.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Traffic police officers direct busy intersections and roundabouts while street cleaners keep the roads clean. Homes, apartments and even the tents of people displaced by war have been numbered in a project to assign addresses to millions of residents.</p><p>Next to the stenciled-on address numbers hang bright green electricity meters — with the power coming from Turkey. That starkly contrasts with areas of Syria that were until recently under the control of the Assad government, where residents mostly rely on generators for power.</p><p>After consolidating control over Idlib Province by attacking other rebel groups, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham brought order to a chaotic region. It has also enjoyed a reputation for avoiding corruption, a relief for many in a country where the government ran on bribes and connections.</p><p>For now, there is excitement — and a bit of apprehension — about what comes next. Even some of the group’s critics are waiting to see how it evolves and grows to manage a whole country, one that is more diverse and less conservative than Idlib.</p><p>In a display case at the Shababeek cafe is a new offering: caramel layer cake with icing in the colors of the changed Syrian flag.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>That flag now decorates much of the city, along with reminders to the population about who has provided their public services up to now.</p><p>On Friday, after weekly prayers, couples, families and young men in camouflage — a few carrying Kalashnikovs — descended on a central roundabout to celebrate the ouster of the Assad regime.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A large crowd after Friday Prayer in the center of Idlib, celebrating the fall of the Assad government.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Guns and a Syrian flag displayed at the home of Muhammad Ali Basha in Idlib.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>In a small park in the center was a plaque installed by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham government: “Renovation of the Seven Seas Roundabout and the area around it — 2021.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The roundabout was also the scene months earlier of <a href="https://stj-sy.org/en/between-reformist-discourse-and-actual-repression-how-hayat-tahrir-al-sham-handled-idlib-protests/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">demonstrations</a> against the group’s administration by hundreds of residents, one of many protests that took place across Idlib Province.</p><p>They were protesting the imprisonment and torture of critics and the imposition of taxes that have been a heavy burden for many residents, according to <a href="https://stj-sy.org/en/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Syrians for Truth and Justice</a>, a human rights advocacy group.</p><p>Muhammad Ali Basha, a 30-year-old rebel fighter and resident of Binnish, a town in Idlib Province, said he had participated in some of the protests.</p><p>“Security-wise, we saw that their behavior was starting to resemble the behavior of the Assad regime,” he said in his house, adding that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and its security arm would raid homes without notice.</p><p>On a dresser next to him were three guns — two AK-47s and a handgun — a Syrian flag and a slew of gold decorative butterflies, positioned like a shrine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In some cases, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham responded to the protests with force, according to Syrians for Truth and Justice.</p><p>The rebel group has denied taking harsh action against residents of Idlib during the protests.</p><p>“When people say there was a violent response, no there was not,” Ahmed al-Shara, the group’s leader, formerly known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-leader-interview.html" title="">in an interview with The New York Times</a>. “There was a response to some people who were destroying people’s properties.”</p><p>He conceded that some of the calls of the protesters were valid, in that certain laws were putting undue economic pressure on residents. “We remedied these and appeased a large part of the population,” he said.</p><p>Custom taxes, which were imposed on people coming from other parts of Syria, were done away with, residents said.</p><p>Residents and human rights groups also say that repression against critics has relented in recent months following the protests.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The experiences of Muna Armanazi, the 63-year-old principal of a private school in the city of Idlib, underline the mixed feelings many residents have about the rebel group.</p><p>On a residential street on Saturday, Ms. Armanazi was overseeing workers repairing and rebuilding walls and classrooms damaged in one of the last airstrikes carried out by the Syrian regime before its ouster. The strikes also killed two people, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Muna Armanazi, a 63-year-old principal of a private school in Idlib, working with a man to repair damage following a recent airstrike.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A burned car at the scene of an airstrike in Idlib before the collapse of the Syrian regime.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>In the days after the strike, Ms. Armanazi went to the city’s public works ministry to ask for help rebuilding the damage to her school. She was told to bring the receipts for the damage and that the government would help cover it, she said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“The institutions are working well,” she said, even if she was sometimes frustrated with how slowly things happened. “Their social services are good.”</p><p>“But,” she added, “in the beginning, when they first came, there was chaos.”</p><p>She cited the hard-line religious stance initially taken and later dropped by the group, including trying to force women to wear face coverings.</p><p>Ms. Armanazi, as an observant Muslim, wears a white hijab, a head scarf that leaves her face uncovered, and an ankle-length black robe outdoors. But her clothing was not conservative enough for members of the group, she said.</p><p>Once, as she was walking down the street, she passed a Hayat Tahrir al-Sham fighter. He chided her for how she was dressed — “Fear God, sister,” she said he told her.</p><p>“I said, ‘You fear God and lower your gaze and keep walking,’” she recalled saying defiantly back to him. But he did not respond further.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Before they were disbanded a few years ago, the morality police would not only harass women but also men with tattoos, said Salwa Jabaan, 51, a journalist with various local media, including the Aleppo Today TV channel.</p><p>“They were interfering in every part of our lives,” said Ms. Jabaan, who also took part in some of the protests against the rebel administration.</p><p>There had been some efforts in the past to revive the morality police, she said. But those efforts were abandoned after opposition from women and as the group began to evolve. Now she sees an even more drastic evolution in the group and in Mr. al-Shara, its leader, as they seek greater international legitimacy.</p><p>“Things have changed a lot over the past few years,” Ms. Jabaan said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-30"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The central square in Idlib on Saturday.
