Kennedy Jr.’s decision to suspend his presidential campaign and endorse former President Donald J. Trump was — depending on where on the political spectrum the coverage came from — treated with either outright glee — or derision. Conservative sites primarily focused on the potential electoral boon to Mr. Trump, while liberal media outlets focused more on Mr. Kennedy’s dysfunctional campaign, including by returning to several negative story lines.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy announced on Friday that he would suspend his presidential campaign in key battleground states, though he intended to remain on the ballot in some states. He suggested he worried his presence in the race would pull voters away from other candidates, though recent polling wasn’t clear about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/us/elections/kennedy-polls-trump-endorsement-effect.html" title="">who might benefit</a> from Mr. Kennedy’s change in plans.</p><p>Conservative sites, more than a dozen of which prominently featured the news on their home pages, saw the news as a win for Mr. Trump. They argued that Mr. Kennedy’s decision could reshape the race by turning Mr. Kennedy’s supporters into Mr. Trump’s, and by shifting the attention of Americans away from this week’s Democratic National Convention.</p><p>Liberal media outlets described Mr. Kennedy’s decision as self-serving, and in keeping with his unpredictable campaign. Several referenced Mr. Kennedy’s assertion that Mr. Trump had offered him a role in a second Trump administration, something the former president declined to confirm on Friday. The sites referred to him using words like “power-hungry” and “transactional.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Here’s how the news was covered by a selection of outlets:</p><h3 id="link-62cb75e5"><span>FROM THE RIGHT</span></h3><h2 id="link-37188d82">The Washington Examiner</h2></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/23/multimedia/MEDIA-BUBBLES-rfkJr-RIGHT1-hkpg/MEDIA-BUBBLES-rfkJr-RIGHT1-hkpg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/23/multimedia/MEDIA-BUBBLES-rfkJr-RIGHT1-hkpg/MEDIA-BUBBLES-rfkJr-RIGHT1-hkpg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/23/multimedia/MEDIA-BUBBLES-rfkJr-RIGHT1-hkpg/MEDIA-BUBBLES-rfkJr-RIGHT1-hkpg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/23/multimedia/MEDIA-BUBBLES-rfkJr-RIGHT1-hkpg/MEDIA-BUBBLES-rfkJr-RIGHT1-hkpg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/23/multimedia/MEDIA-BUBBLES-rfkJr-RIGHT1-hkpg/MEDIA-BUBBLES-rfkJr-RIGHT1-hkpg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/23/multimedia/MEDIA-BUBBLES-rfkJr-RIGHT1-hkpg/MEDIA-BUBBLES-rfkJr-RIGHT1-hkpg-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/23/multimedia/MEDIA-BUBBLES-rfkJr-RIGHT1-hkpg/MEDIA-BUBBLES-rfkJr-RIGHT1-hkpg-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1830w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="512"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Washington Examiner</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Though polling suggests Mr. Kennedy’s decision is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/us/elections/kennedy-polls-trump-endorsement-effect.html" title="">unlikely to significantly shift</a> the race between Vice President Kamala Harris and Mr. Trump, many conservative commentators said the decision could swing the contest.

Jr. Lays Out How the D.N.C. Dismantled Democracy,” Hannah Knudsen, a Breitbart reporter, focused on Mr. Kennedy’s comments on Friday about how Democrats tried keep him off the ballot in some states. Ms. Knudsen wrote that Mr. Kennedy highlighted that “Democrats essentially dismantled democracy while supposedly trying to save it.”</p></div></div><div><div><h3 id="link-332a3d8"><span>FROM THE LEFT</span></h3><h2 id="link-3292a6">Slate</h2><p>Liberal media outlets were less convinced that Mr. Kennedy’s announcement would markedly help Republicans in November. But they continued to characterize Mr. Kennedy unfavorably for even trying to help Mr. Trump.</p><p>Ben Mathis-Lilley, a senior writer for the liberal site Slate, said Mr. Kennedy’s campaign was ending “like the lives of the brain worms, allegedly barbecued dogs and bears found deceased on a roadside who have had the misfortune of crossing paths with him.”</p><p>The site had previously referred to supporters of his in Silicon Valley as his “<a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/05/robert-kennedy-jr-brain-worm-ackman-musk-dorsey.html?pay=1724505112826&amp;support_journalism=please" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brain Worm Coalition</a>,” in reference to Mr. Kennedy’s comments in May that he had a parasite in his head. One article called his running mate, the lawyer Nicole Shanahan, a “<a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/03/nicole-shanahan-bio-rfk-jr-vp-google-money.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rich rando</a>,” shorthand for a random person, and another said Mr. Kennedy <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/07/rfk-jr-vanity-fair-dog-9-11-harassment-allegation-conspiracies.html?pay=1724505302982&amp;support_journalism=please" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appeared</a> “more erratic than ever” last month in a piece summing a selection of his public appearances.</p><p>Referring to Mr. Kennedy as “unpredictable,” Mr. Mathis-Lilley questioned Mr. Trump’s strategy of bringing him on as a campaign surrogate.</p><p>“What’s to say that he won’t decide in a month that he needs to denounce Trump and re-enter the race?” Mr. Mathis-Lilley wrote.</p></div></div><div><p><h3 id="link-332a3d8"><span>FROM THE LEFT</span></h3><h2 id="link-64eeadf3">Meidas Touch</h2></p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Meidas Touch News</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Meidas Touch, a liberal news outlet, reacted to the news with an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BVSyHZDdZs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">episode</a> of its “Legal AF” podcast. On it, Michael Popok, a host, said that Mr. Kennedy’s campaign had been in free fall since he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/04/us/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr-bear-central-park.html" title="">admitted to leaving the carcass of a bear cub</a> in Central Park in 2014. He also referenced Mr. Kennedy’s assertion on Friday that Mr. Trump had offered him a role in a second Trump administration.</p><p>“He’ll sell himself to the highest bidder,” Mr. Popok said. “I thought Donald Trump was transactional.
