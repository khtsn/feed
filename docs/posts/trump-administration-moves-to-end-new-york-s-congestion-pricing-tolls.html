    <h1>Trump Administration Moves to End New York’s Congestion Pricing Tolls</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>But Mr. Trump has said that he would end the tolls because he claimed that they were drawing visitors and businesses away from Manhattan. Observers have speculated that he would try to withdraw federal approval for the plan or threaten to withhold federal funding.</p><p>Already, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc.html" title="">early data suggested that gridlock had lessened</a> during program’s initial weeks as fewer drivers piled into the tolled area. </p><p>In the first week of February, weekday traffic inside the tolling zone was down 9 percent compared to the same time last year, with an average of 561,678 vehicles entering the area, down from 617,000, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the program.</p><p>And foot traffic, a measure of business activity, has improved since the toll took effect, according to the city’s Economic Development Corporation. Through Jan. 31, 35.8 million pedestrians entered major business districts in the tolling zone, nearly 5 percent more than in the same period last year.</p><p>But the toll was unpopular and had been challenged by many powerful opponents, including Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey, who wrote a letter to Mr. Trump on Jan. 20 — the day of his inauguration — urging him to stop the tolls. New Jersey had fought hard to prevent the program from taking effect, filing a lawsuit that had been widely considered to be its most formidable threat. Days before the scheduled start of congestion pricing, Judge Leo M. Gordon of the U.S. District Court in New Jersey ruled in favor of the program’s supporters, and the plan moved forward.</p></div></div>
