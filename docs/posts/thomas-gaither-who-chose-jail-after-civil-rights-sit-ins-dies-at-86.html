The local news no longer covered them.</p><p>Then, in 1961, a 22-year-old organizer, Thomas Gaither, introduced a new tactic. In the next sit-in, at the lunch counter of a McCrory’s dime store in Rock Hill, Black students led by him were dragged off counter stools by police officers. But this time, instead of paying a $100 trespassing fine, as earlier protesters did, they chose to serve 30-day sentences on the county chain gang.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Their “jail no bail” tactic dramatized their moral commitment and changed the direction of the civil rights movement. Within days, protesters in other cities followed suit, their incarceration drawing more attention and protests.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The protesters known as the Friendship Nine, who were arrested at a McCrory’s lunch counter in Rock Hill in 1961.

He was 86.</p><p>A little-sung catalyst of the civil rights protests of the 1960s, Mr. Gaither was one of a legion of activists who, driven by high moral purpose, peacefully put their bodies on the line to fight racial discrimination, actions that helped bring about historic federal laws to end legal segregation and ensure voting rights.</p><p>At Claflin College, an all-Black institution in Orangeburg, S.C., he was president of the youth chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. In March 1960, he was co-leader of a march of some 1,000 students protesting segregated businesses. His fellow leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/obituaries/charles-mcdew-79-tactician-for-student-civil-rights-group-dies.html" title="">Charles McDew</a>, was enrolled at nearby South Carolina State College, also historically Black; he went on to be chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, a national civil rights group.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The peaceful Orangeburg marchers were attacked with fire hoses and tear gas, leading to 388 arrests.

Ahead of the “jail no bail” sit-in in Rock Hill, on Jan. 31, 1961, he helped train the protesters, eight students from Friendship Junior College. He and the students became known as the “Friendship Nine” after opting to serve jail sentences.</p><p>“I felt that there should be more perhaps of a commitment on our part — being willing to suffer for something that we really wanted to have happen,” Mr. Gaither <a href="https://www.crmvet.org/nars/gaithert.htm#tg_sitin" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a 2011 oral history of the civil rights movement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“The amazing thing about the Friendship Nine,” he added, “was that we took essentially a group of college students who had no knowledge at all of tactical nonviolence and we pulled off one of the most important protest events of the movement.”</p><p>Several months later, Mr. Gaither and a fellow CORE organizer, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/24/us/gordon-carey-dead.html" title="">Gordon Carey</a>, were stranded in a snowstorm on the New Jersey Turnpike on a bus headed to CORE’s office in New York City.</p><p>With hours to kill, they both read a biography of Mahatma Gandhi, the apostle of nonviolent protest, and tossed around ways to keep the momentum of the sit-ins going. They hatched the idea for the first Freedom Ride: an integrated group of activists who would take a bus trip from Washington through the Deep South. The idea was to dramatize the refusal of Southern states to comply with Supreme Court rulings that segregated interstate buses and terminals were unconstitutional.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Gaither, right, with a Freedom Rider, Henry Thomas, 19, as they arrived at a courthouse in 1961 in Jackson, Miss.

The commercial buses they rode in were firebombed. The police abetted the violence, and hospitals refused to treat bloodied victims.</p><p>National publicity drew hundreds more activists, who made dozens of Freedom Rides crisscrossing the South through 1961. The violence shocked the nation, no less because of the complicity of the Southern authorities in allowing it to happen in defense of Jim Crow laws.</p><p>Mr. Gaither was not on the original Freedom Ride of May 1961; CORE had assigned him to scout the route and contact local supporters to house the riders. He was staying at the home of the civil rights leader <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/18/obituaries/ralph-david-abernathy-rights-pioneer-is-dead-at-64.html" title="">the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy</a> in Montgomery, Ala., on May 20 when riders arriving at the Greyhound station there were beaten with baseball bats and iron pipes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The next night, more than 1,500 people went to Mr. Abernathy’s church to hear the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. speak as a rock-throwing white mob surrounded the building. Dr. King called on Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to send federal protection.</p><p>Mr. Gaither moved on to Jackson, Miss., the destination for hundreds of Freedom Riders through the summer, where they were arrested and — adopting the jail-no-bail strategy — sent to the state penitentiary known as <a href="https://innocenceproject.org/the-lasting-legacy-of-parchman-farm-the-prison-modeled-after-a-slave-plantation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Parchman Farm</a>.</p><p>Thomas Walter Gaither was born on Nov. 12, 1938, in rural Great Falls, S.C., one of five children of Walter B. and Fannie (Little) Gaither. His parents met as students at Friendship Junior College. Both were initially schoolteachers, but his father was fired when he confronted a white school board member who was pocketing $5 a month from his salary, Mr. Gaither said in the oral history. Walter Gaither became a brick mason.</p><p>Thomas’s mother, he recalled, was “very strong in her insistence that we not get involved in things that took us off the path to going to college and to getting an education.”</p><p>He graduated as valedictorian of Great Falls High School and won a $75 yearly scholarship to Claflin College (now Claflin University).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>In 1962, after the sit-ins and the Freedom Rides had passed into history, he entered graduate school at Clark Atlanta University to avoid the military draft, where he earned a masters in biology. He earned a Ph.D. in botany at the University of Iowa.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Gaither in 2005 at Slippery Rock University in Pennsylvania, where he was a professor of biology.

He retired in 2007. He was married for 58 years to Diane (Jenner) Gaither, a mental health therapist, who <a href="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/butlereagle/name/diane-gaither-obituary?id=7501247" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">died</a> in 2021.</p><p>He is survived by his sons T. Kenn and Edmund Andre Gaither; five grandchildren; his brothers, Herman and Edmund Barry Gaither; and his sisters, Glenda Davis and Diane Gaither Thompson.</p><p>In his later years, Dr. Gaither recognized that the civil rights movement had profoundly changed America, but also that the structures of racism had remained in his native South.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>“No question, the South has changed tremendously,” he said in 2011. “But the fundamental infrastructure of racism and segregation that called the shots in the South in 1960 are still in place. They have slightly different labels, they accomplish their goals by slightly different means, but there has been no real fundamental shift in who really calls the signals.”</p></div></section></article></div>
