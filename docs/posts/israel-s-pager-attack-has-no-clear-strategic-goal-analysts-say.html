Hezbollah and the Israeli military remained locked in the same pattern, exchanging missiles and artillery fire on Wednesday at a tempo in keeping with the daily skirmishes fought between the sides since October.</p><p>Although Tuesday’s attack was an eye-catching demonstration of Israel’s technological prowess, Israel has not initially sought to capitalize on the confusion it sowed by initiating a decisive blow against Hezbollah and invading Lebanon.</p><p>And if the attack impressed many Israelis, some of whom had criticized their government for failing to stop Hezbollah’s strikes, their core frustration remains: Hezbollah is still entrenched on Israel’s northern border, preventing tens of thousands of residents of northern Israel from returning home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“This is an amazing tactical event,” said Miri Eisin, a fellow at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism, an Israel-based research organization.</p><p>“But not a single Hezbollah fighter is going to move because of this,” said Ms. Eisin, a former senior intelligence officer. “Having amazing capabilities does not make a strategy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chaos hit hospitals around Beirut on Tuesday, including the American University of Beirut Medical Center, where many people wounded in the explosions were taken.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anwar Amro/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Israelis are divided about whether the attack was born from short-term opportunism or long-term forethought. Some believe that Israeli commanders feared that their Hezbollah counterparts had recently discovered Israel’s ability to sabotage the pagers, prompting Israeli commanders to immediately blow them up or risk losing the capability forever.</p><p>Others say that Israel had a specific strategic intent. Israel may have hoped that the attack’s brazenness and sophistication would ultimately make Hezbollah more amenable to a cease-fire in the coming weeks, if not immediately.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The goal of the operation, if Israel was behind it as Hezbollah claims, may have been to show Hezbollah that it will pay a very high price if it continues its attacks on Israel instead of reaching an agreement,” said Maj. Gen. Amos Yadlin, a former head of Israel’s military intelligence directorate.</p><p>Hezbollah began firing on Israel in early October in solidarity with Hamas, after its Palestinian ally raided southern Israel, prompting a large-scale Israeli counterattack on Gaza. Since then, Hezbollah has tied its fate to that of Hamas, vowing that it will not stop fighting until Israel withdraws from Gaza.</p><p>Given the connection, officials either side of the border have hoped for months that a truce in Gaza would lead to a parallel agreement in Lebanon. American and French mediators, led by Amos Hochstein, a U.S. envoy, have shuttled between Beirut and Jerusalem, preparing the ground for a truce between Israel and Hezbollah in the event of a deal in Gaza.</p><p>With negotiations over Gaza now at an impasse, the Israeli leadership may believe it has to take more ambitious action against Hezbollah to persuade the group to disentangle its fate from that of Hamas, analysts said. In recent days, the Israeli leadership has intensified its public focus on Hezbollah, with the country’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, warning this week that “military action” was “the only way” to end the conflict.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“The point is to disconnect the war Hezbollah declared on Israel from the war with Hamas,” Mr. Yadlin said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Burned motorbikes in July at a Golan Heights soccer field that was hit by a rocket fired from Lebanon.

It shows “such a gap between the politicians and the security establishment.”</p><p>Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> and <!-- -->Rawan Sheikh Ahmad<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick Kingsley is The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief, leading coverage of Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-kingsley">More about Patrick Kingsley</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Netanyahu Considers Firing Gallant:</strong><strong> </strong>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is reportedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-netanyahu-gallant.html">contemplating dismissing his defense minister</a>, Yoav Gallant, a move that would remove a frequent critic at a time of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-gaza.html">mounting tensions with Hezbollah</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hostage Deaths:</strong><strong> </strong>Israel’s military announced that, based on an internal investigation, three hostages were probably killed as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-killed-strike.html">result of an Israeli airstrike</a> targeting a senior Hamas commander in November.</p></li><li><p><strong>​​Fight Over Philadelphi Corridor:</strong><strong> </strong>The border between Egypt and Gaza has become a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/middleeast/philadelphi-corridor-israel-gaza-egypt.html">major point of contention in cease-fire negotiations</a> — not just between Israel and Hamas, but also between Israel and Egypt.</p></li><li><p><strong>How UNRWA Became a Flashpoint:</strong><strong> </strong>The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees has survived 75 years of Israeli-Palestinian strife. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/magazine/unrwa-gaza-war.html">Can it survive the latest conflict</a>?</p></li><li><p><strong>Israel Raids Secret Weapons Site: </strong>Israel carried out a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/middleeast/israel-raid-syria-hezbollah.html">commando raid in Syria</a> that obliterated a Hezbollah missile production facility near the Lebanese border, according to American and other Western officials.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
