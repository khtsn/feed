Trump is signaling with his staffing decisions his intention to carry out a campaign promise of widespread deportations of undocumented immigrants and tightening of measures that allow some of them to stay in the country legally.</p><p>Stephen Miller, an immigration hard-liner and adviser to Mr. Trump, is taking over policy planning for the transition and is expected to be named deputy chief of staff in his administration, people briefed on the matter said on Monday.</p><p>And late Sunday, Mr. Trump announced on social media that Thomas Homan, the acting director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency during Mr. Trump’s first term, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-homan-immigration-border.html" title="">would be his “border czar.”</a></p><p>It remains to be seen how broad Mr. Miller’s portfolio will be, but it is expected to be vast and to far exceed what the eventual title will convey, according to the people briefed on the matter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A Trump spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Miller also did not respond to a message seeking comment.</p><p>Mr. Miller’s views are favored by Mr. Trump’s hard-line base. Vice President-elect JD Vance and Donald Trump Jr., who has been influential in the transition, <a href="https://x.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1856010089267605940" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">praised the prospective choice</a> on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>The expected move was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/11/politics/stephen-miller-trump-administration/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported earlier by CNN</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump has talked repeatedly since 2023 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/us/politics/trump-2025-immigration-agenda.html" title="">about his plans</a> for the largest deportation effort in the country’s history. Among the only potential restraints on those efforts might be negative media coverage, such as the kind he faced when his first administration enacted the policy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/us/politics/family-separation-trump.html" title="">of separating children</a> from their parents during unauthorized border crossings. Mr. Homan was an ardent supporter of that policy.</p><p>Mr. Miller is expected to work closely with Mr. Homan to oversee the planned deportations, as well as the nation’s maritime and aviation security. In an interview with “60 Minutes” that aired on CBS in October, Mr. Homan described “targeted arrests” and workplace enforcements when asked about the deportation plan.</p><p>“It’s not OK to enter a country illegally, which is a crime,” he said. “That’s what drives illegal immigration, when there’s no consequences.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Miller was an influential aide in Mr. Trump’s first term and has remained an important adviser and speechwriter. He has been involved in Mr. Trump’s early transition planning meetings since their election victory last Tuesday and is expected to play a key role in staffing the government — especially regarding roles that intersect with immigration policy.</p><p>While many former Trump aides made themselves scarce after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, Mr. Miller stayed close to Mr. Trump immediately after he left office. Mr. Miller advised Mr. Trump’s team on messaging and policy and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/us/politics/stephen-miller-america-first-legal.html" title="">formed a nonprofit group, America First Legal Foundation</a>, to battle the Biden administration in the courts. He has been a frequent presence on Fox News defending Mr. Trump.</p><p>Mr. Miller traveled with Mr. Trump during the campaign and encouraged Mr. Trump’s instincts to elevate immigration as the top issue in the closing weeks of the race.</p><p>Mr. Miller, along with several of Mr. Trump’s first-term advisers who will return to the administration, also knows far more about the mechanisms of the federal government than he did when he first joined in 2017.</p><p>Over the past two years, Mr. Miller has also been working on detailed plans for mass deportations. He outlined these and other hard-line immigration policies in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/us/politics/trump-2025-immigration-agenda.html" title="">interview with The New York Times last year</a>. The plans include restricting legal and illegal immigration in a number of ways, including rounding up undocumented immigrants already in the United States and detaining them in camps before they’re expelled from the country.</p><p>A handful of other people from the top of Mr. Trump’s campaign ranks are expected to be among the deputy chiefs of staff announced as soon as Monday.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a senior political correspondent reporting on the 2024 presidential campaign, down ballot races across the country and the investigations into former President Donald J.
