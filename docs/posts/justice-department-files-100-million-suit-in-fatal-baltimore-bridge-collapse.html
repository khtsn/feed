The action also seeks punitive damages, but does not name an amount.</p><p>Filed in federal court in Maryland, the Justice Department’s action lays out in detail what investigators have learned about the ship’s short and catastrophic journey that night, describing a cascade of failures onboard and multiple points when the disaster could have been prevented.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Because of poor maintenance or “jury-rigged” fixes to serious problems aboard the ship, known as the Dali, “none of the four means available to help control the Dali — her propeller, rudder, anchor, or bow thruster — worked when they were needed to avert or even mitigate this disaster,” the suit asserts.</p><p>The Dali is registered in Singapore and owned by Grace Ocean Ltd. and managed by Synergy Marine Group, both of which are based in Singapore.</p><p>The companies — referred to as petitioners in the legal papers — had said their liability for the incident should be limited to no more than $44 million. Representatives of the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday morning.</p><p>Justice Department officials said they could not comment on the status of a separate federal criminal investigation into the crash.</p><p>The Dali, as long as the height of the Eiffel Tower, lost power and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/26/us/key-bridge-collapse-baltimore-what-to-know.html" title="">slammed into the<span>  </span>Key Bridge on March 26</a>, causing the bridge to collapse and killing six men who were repairing pavement on the bridge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Tuesday, the families of three of the men who were killed announced that they, too, were suing the owner of the Dali. The deadline for filing such a civil claim is next week.</p><p>The ship became stuck in the twisted wreckage as the bridge fell into the Patapsco River, blocking access to the Port of Baltimore, one of the busiest on the East Coast. An enormous cleanup effort was begun, involving dozens of barges, tugboats, excavators, floating cranes and even explosives. Some 50,000 tons of debris had to be cleared from the river.</p><p>Temporary shipping channels were soon reopened to some vessels, and in May, after enough wreckage was removed, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/20/us/dali-moving-key-bridge-baltimore.html" title="">the Dali was dislodged</a> and made the two-and-a-half-mile trip back upriver to the terminal it had left two months before. The badly damaged ship was later moved to a shipyard in Norfolk for repairs.</p><p>The main shipping route, the 700-foot-wide Fort McHenry Federal Channel, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/us/baltimore-bridge-shipping-channel.html" title="">not fully cleared until June</a>. And rebuilding the bridge will take much longer. State officials have said that it would take four years to reconstruct the Key Bridge at a cost of up to $1.9 billion.</p><p>A Justice Department official said Wednesday that the state of Maryland would attempt to recoup the cost of rebuilding the bridge through legal actions.</p><p>The ship was headed for Sri Lanka at the time of the crash with around 4,700 containers on board, as well as 1.5 million gallons of fuel and lubricant oil. None of the 21 members of the crew, most of whom were Indian citizens, were injured in the crash; neither were two pilots who were aboard at the time. </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Campbell Robertson reports on Delaware, the District of Columbia, Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia, for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/campbell-robertson">More about Campbell Robertson</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
