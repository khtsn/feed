In this global year of elections, Mr. Blair is offering lessons to any rookie leader who will listen — about geopolitical upheaval, surging populism and how to deal with a politically unstable United States.</p><p>“I think you’d have to say American politics in some ways has become bitterly divided and at a certain level, dysfunctional,” Mr. Blair said in an interview. “But it’s happened at the same time as America itself has re-emerged as, in my view, easily the strongest country in the world.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Affable, expansive and only fleetingly defensive, Mr. Blair, now 71, offered a reminder of why, 17 years after he left Downing Street, he remains an enduring presence but also something of a riddle.</p><p>He spoke proudly of his government’s achievements in overhauling education and strengthening Britain’s public health service. Yet in his lucrative post-government career, which has included advisory roles for banks, Middle East diplomacy and his own consulting business, he has drawn criticism for mixing too readily with autocrats and billionaires. He defended engaging with Saudi Arabia and extolled the transformative potential of A.I. in government — only to become reticent on the subject of Elon Musk, whose inventions he celebrates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Keir Starmer outside Downing Street with his wife, Victoria.

Although he is still reviled by many in Britain for his decision to join the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq — Queen Elizabeth II’s conferral of a knighthood on him in 2022 drew angry protests — Mr. Blair has cultivated ties with Mr. Starmer and quietly assumed the status of an elder statesman.</p><p>Within the Labour Party, Mr. Blair is credited with being a masterful communicator — a talent that seems even more striking in comparison with Mr. Starmer, who is by all accounts a less charismatic figure. After Mr. Starmer’s drumbeat of warnings that the economic legacy left by his Conservative predecessors will mean hard choices, some critics yearn for a bit of Mr. Blair’s bounce.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Blair celebrates the inventions of Elon Musk in his book but was reticent on the subject of Mr. Musk’s emergence as a political influencer and purveyor of conspiracy theories. “It’s their inventions I’m interested in, not their politics,” he said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In his book, Mr. Blair emphasized the need for leaders to project optimism. “No one wants to get on a plane with a depressed pilot,” he wrote. But he was careful not to apply that to Mr. Starmer, whom he said had inherited a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/19/business/britain-economy-inflation.html" title="">far worse economy</a> than he did. Mr. Starmer also came into office after the upheaval of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/07/world/europe/brexit-uk-seafood.html" title="">Brexit</a>.</p><p>“He’s our sixth prime minister in eight years,” Mr. Blair said, raising his eyebrows. “This is Britain. When I left office, I’d been the third prime minister in almost 30 years.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Having emphasized the scale of the challenge, Mr. Blair said he expected that Mr. Starmer would be “balancing that out” in coming speeches with more upbeat plans to recharge the economy and improve life in Britain.</p><p>In the sleek Fitzrovia offices of Mr. Blair’s institute, there are relics of his time as prime minister, as well as of his diplomacy afterward: A photograph of him posing with Irish leaders after they sealed the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/11/world/irish-accord-overview-irish-talks-produce-accord-stop-decades-bloodshed-with.html" title="">Good Friday Agreement</a> in 1998, ending decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. A signed photo of him with John Kerry, in which Mr. Kerry, a former secretary of state, thanked him for his work as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/23/world/europe/23cnd-blair.html" title="">special envoy for Middle East</a> peace.</p><p>These days, Mr. Blair said he was fully occupied by his institute, which works with governments in 40 countries. Some of those clients are autocrats, for which Mr. Blair makes no apology. He defended his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/12/tony-blair-institute-continued-taking-money-from-saudi-arabia-after-khashoggi" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dealings</a> with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, for example, despite evidence that he was responsible for the killing of the dissident journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p>“I don’t think any of us who believe we should engage with Saudi Arabia has ever dialed back our disapproval of that,” Mr. Blair said. “But I do think that what is happening in Saudi Arabia is a social revolution which has immense and positive implications for our security, and for the Middle East.”</p><p>Mr. Blair pointed to American efforts to broker a three-way deal between Saudi Arabia, Israel and the United States as proof of the upside of such engagement, although the war in Gaza has raised hurdles to that negotiation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>On the most contentious issue of his premiership, the Iraq War and the futile search for weapons of mass destruction, Mr. Blair has little new to say. “I’ve dealt with it so many times,” he said, citing his 2010 memoir and multiple public inquiries. “I’ve come to the conclusion, you’re not going to convince anyone who’s not convinced.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Blair’s decision to join the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq became the most contentious issue of his time in office and cast a long shadow over his legacy in other areas, including Britain’s public services.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>To the extent that Iraq figures in Mr. Blair’s thinking, it is as a lesson for how leaders should tend to their legacies so they are not defined by a single issue. “I didn’t do enough, frankly,” he said, adding, “It’s ultimately going to be determined in years to come by people you’ve never met.”</p><p>For Mr. Blair, perhaps the thorniest diplomatic dilemma today is navigating between China, with which many countries have trade ties, and the United States, on which many rely for security. This is becoming almost a binary choice, he said. Under pressure from the United States, for example, Britain banned the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from its high-speed wireless network.</p><p>“If you’re a developing country that’s already got a strong relationship with Huawei, you’ve got to think, ‘How do I manage that?’” Mr. Blair said. If a leader decides to defy Washington and align with Beijing, he said, “Then there’s certain companies that won’t be doing business in your country.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>As for the United States, Mr. Blair proclaimed himself an optimist, despite the upheaval of the last several years. He steered clear of questions about the presidential election, instead noting that America was the world’s leading military power, largest exporter of oil and gas and No. 1 technology innovator.</p><p>“My view,” Mr. Blair said, “is that America will go through this period and return to functionality, and the question is, how it does that.”</p><p>Still, he concluded, the radical swings in American politics provided an argument for preserving Britain’s constitutional monarchy. The queen and now King Charles III, he said, have acted as a stabilizing force against the gyrations of post-Brexit Britain — an anchor that does not exist in its former colonies.</p><p>“If you guys change your mind,” Mr. Blair said with a twinkle, “we’ll let you back.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tony Blair at his institute’s office in London.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Testa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mark Landler is the London bureau chief of The Times, covering the United Kingdom, as well as American foreign policy in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
