    <h1>Nasal Flu Vaccine Is Approved for At-Home Use</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The agency required the company to study whether its instructions were clear and whether at-home administration was feasible. The agency concluded that it was, but advised caregivers to give the spray to those who are 2 to 17 years old.</p><p>The flu takes a steep toll that varies greatly from year to year, according to an F.D.A. summary of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. From 2010 through 2023, hospitalizations have ranged from 100,000 to 700,000 each year, and from about 4,900 to 51,000 people have died.</p><p>FluMist was first approved by the F.D.A. in 2003 for people ages 5 to 49; since 2007, it has been authorized for people as young as 2 years old. The spray contains a weakened form of live flu virus that is applied inside the nose.</p><p>According <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/nasalspray.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to the C.D.C.</a>, the nasal spray has largely been found to be as effective as the shot, except for children in 2009, a year of particularly high levels of flu cases. Since then, the formula of the spray has changed, according to the agency, which said studies outside the United States found it to have similar efficacy to the shot.</p><p>Dr. Abraar Karan, a Stanford infectious disease doctor, said he saw a lot of flu patients in urgent care. He added that many said they had meant to get a vaccine, but found that the major challenge was basic logistics: making an appointment, missing work and building in time to feel tired or achy after receiving the vaccine.</p></div></div>
