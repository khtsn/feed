Cuomo in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/nyc-mayor-race" title="">the June 24 Democratic primary</a>, or to temper their support for him if they do, according to six people familiar with the effort.</p><p>Mr. Adams’s allies have indicated they believe he would have a better chance of winning the general election if <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/nyregion/mamdani-age-mayor-young.html" title="">Zohran Mamdani</a>, the democratic socialist assemblyman now polling in second place, defeats Mr. Cuomo and becomes the Democratic nominee.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At the same time, Mr. Adams has used his mayoral powers to make policy pronouncements that seem designed to resonate with some Orthodox Jews. He signed an <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/executive-orders/2025/eo-52.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> recognizing the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s <a href="https://holocaustremembrance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IHRA-non-legally-binding-working-definition-of-antisemitism-1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">definition</a> of antisemitism and created the Mayor’s Office to Combat Antisemitism to address the spike in antisemitic hate crimes in the city.</p><p>“He is going around to people to ask for support for the general election,” said Rabbi Moishe Indig, a leader of one faction of the Satmar Hasidic group in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. “He would love that everyone just ignore the primary and wait until the fall.”</p><p>The mayor’s efforts have had mixed results. Mr. Cuomo, the race’s front-runner, has rolled out a series of endorsements from important Orthodox rabbis in Brooklyn and Queens in recent days, but lost out on others.</p><p>The mayor’s influence campaign suggests he sees an opportunity to try to weaken his chief rival at the margins and make a case before the general election that his own candidacy is still viable.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo has rolled out a series of endorsements from Orthodox Jewish leaders in recent days.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adam Gray for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Adams’s long-shot path to victory depends on his winning support from churchgoing Black New Yorkers and Orthodox Jews, who often vote in large numbers as a bloc, an adviser said. It also depends on enough New Yorkers giving Mr. Adams a pass on his federal criminal charges, which he successfully lobbied the Trump administration to abandon.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Adams contested the notion that Mr. Cuomo had any sort of hold on the Orthodox vote.</p><p>“He’ll take two or three people from a community and he’ll give the impression that, oh, he has the entire community,” Mr. Adams said. “That’s just not the reality.”</p><p>Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, shot back, saying, “We’re not surprised the mayor is trying to play games behind the scenes. He’ll say and do anything to his own personal benefit — remember this is the same person who sold out New York City in a quid pro quo with Donald Trump.”</p><p>Mr. Adams’s outreach to the Orthodox community has come in various forms. He has gathered petitions to run on two ballot lines, EndAntiSemitism and Safe&amp;Affordable. (State election rules will require him to choose one or the other; he cannot run on both, a city Board of Elections spokesman said. Todd Shapiro, spokesman for Mr. Adams’s campaign, said it is actively reviewing all legal options. “New Yorkers deserve the right to support him on either,” Mr. Shapiro, who is not related to Menashe Shapiro, said.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>His team has also highlighted other candidates’ positions that they seem to think will be unpopular in Orthodox communities.</p><p>The night of the race’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/04/nyregion/nyc-mayoral-debate" title="">first mayoral debate</a> among Democratic candidates, Menashe Shapiro sent messages to Orthodox Jewish leaders highlighting the candidates’ demands that immigration authorities release Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil from detention. They included a <a href="https://x.com/jacobkornbluh/status/1930438082177675646" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media post</a> from a reporter highlighting Mr. Cuomo’s stance that Mr. Khalil should be released.</p><p>A spokeswoman for City Hall had no immediate comment. Todd Shapiro said, “Menashe is fully entitled to his personal beliefs.” The mayor has taken the stance that he will not comment on federal immigration actions.</p><p>A few days after the debate, Mr. Adams joined Dr. Phil McGraw, an ardent supporter of the Trump administration’s deportation agenda, at a Lower Manhattan synagogue where he signed an <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/executive-orders/2025/eo-52.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> recognizing the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s <a href="https://holocaustremembrance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IHRA-non-legally-binding-working-definition-of-antisemitism-1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">definition</a> of antisemitism.</p><p>“Calls to globalize the Intifada are vile hate speech, but this type of speech has become normalized, and campuses must stop it from continuing,” Mr. Adams said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Adams said the actions that qualify as antisemitism under that definition include accusing Jews of exaggerating the Holocaust, describing Israel as a “racist endeavor” or holding all Jews responsible for Israel’s actions. He suggested the executive order would not influence law enforcement activities, but would allow City Hall to “crack down” on some city-funded nonprofits.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Adams did not elaborate on what a crackdown would look like. “The procurement process for contracts is to go with the lowest responsible bidder, and that remains the law,” she said.</p><p>Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said Mr. Adams was “weaponizing the critical fight against antisemitism to suppress protected political speech he doesn’t like.”</p><p>Kayla Mamelak Altus, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said Mr. Adams was merely doing what he has always done.</p><p>“As mayor of the city with the largest Jewish populations outside of Israel, Mayor Adams has always stood with New York City’s Jewish communities — not only working to uplift and empower them, but confronting the disturbing rise in antisemitism since Oct. 7, 2023,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In recent days, Mr. Cuomo has picked up support from key rabbis in the Williamsburg and Crown Heights neighborhoods of Brooklyn and in Far Rockaway, Queens, despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/nyregion/israel-gaza-antisemitism-mayor-nyc.html" title="">lingering resentment</a> of his policies during the pandemic.</p><p>But he lost out to Adrienne Adams, the City Council speaker, late Monday for <a href="https://x.com/jacobkornbluh/status/1932282445291778082?s=12&amp;t=jcABx_iRqrQNpjRRDZ36-Q" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">endorsements</a> from some Jewish leaders in Borough Park. Two people familiar with the matter, who, like the others declined to discuss private conversations on the record, said the endorsements came after Menashe Shapiro urged community leaders to back anyone but Mr. Cuomo.</p><p>Kalman Yeger, an Orthodox assemblyman who once represented the area as a city councilman, sharply criticized the choice of Ms. Adams as “irresponsible,” arguing that she had not been a friend to Jewish New Yorkers.</p><p>Though he did not explicitly blame City Hall for the endorsement, he said that it was clear to him that selection “has nothing to do with Adrienne Adams.”</p><p>A spokeswoman for Ms. Adams declined to comment.</p><p>During the Sunday event with Dr. Phil, Rabbi Indig neatly illustrated some of the dynamics at play among Mr. Adams, Mr. Cuomo and the field. Rabbi Indig is one of Mr. Adams’s closest allies in the Orthodox community, standing onstage behind Mr. Adams during his 2021 victory party.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“We will come out and show our great support for our great mayor and brother Eric Adams” in November, he told the mayor.</p><p>The next day, he endorsed Mr. Cuomo in the Democratic primary, along with Ms. Adams.</p><p>In an interview, Rabbi Indig said that he understood that Mr. Adams wanted Mr. Cuomo to fail but that he would endorse the former governor anyway.</p><p>“I know what he wants, I know what he feels,” Rabbi Indig said. “But we have a good relationship with Cuomo when he was still governor.”</p><p>In a possible nod to the Adams team’s lobbying efforts, Rabbi Indig said he had met with Mr. Mamdani and was still considering adding him to his slate of endorsements despite the assemblyman’s outspoken criticism of Israel, which has alienated other Orthodox leaders.</p><p>“He came across to be a very nice guy, very humble,” he said of Mr. Mamdani. “According to my conversation, he told me that he’s not an antisemite and he would work with the entire city, all communities. As mayor, we wouldn’t have a problem with him. But because of all the public statements, it’s a little difficult.”</p><p>It remains unclear if Rabbi Indig’s endorsement will extend beyond the Democratic primary.</p><p>“The fall? God knows,” he said. “Nobody knows what’s going to happen in the fall.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Dana Rubinstein covers New York City politics and government for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Nicholas Fandos is a Times reporter covering New York politics and government.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on the N.Y.C.
