The fabrications have also been spread by broadcast and social media in India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is an ally of Ms. Hasina and is sheltering her as she plots her return.</p><p>Caught between the authentic and the exaggerated, Bangladesh’s Hindus, who make up about 9 percent of a population that is overwhelmingly Muslim, are gripped with fear.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Smiles are rare, and businesses are struggling,” said S.K. Nath Shymal, the president of the Bangladesh National Hindu Grand Alliance in the coastal city of Chattogram, the center of some of the worst recent tensions.</p><p>The New York Times visited the sites of many of the reported attacks in Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital, and in Chattogram, the country’s second-largest city.</p><p>Hindu residents confirmed episodes of vandalism and mob violence, particularly after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/world/asia/india-bangladesh-relations-hindu.html" title="">arrest of a Hindu monk in November</a> and the death of a Muslim lawyer during a protest by the monk’s supporters.</p><p>But they also said that the cases of forged or exaggerated information had muddied the real threat to them.</p><p>Mr. Shymal said that all sides were “exploiting us.”</p><p>At home, Bangladesh’s interim government, led by the Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, often downplays the threat to minorities to show it is in control. The Yunus government says it is committed to protecting minorities and points to 70 arrests related to 88 attacks over the past three months.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Across the border in India, the threat is being exaggerated to score political points among right-wing Hindus as well as to pave a path for Ms. Hasina’s restoration.</p><p>Before now, Islamic extremists were pushed to the margins by Ms. Hasina’s police state. With her gone and an unelected interim government in place, the extremists have returned more openly.</p><p>In the widespread political violence that followed her departure, hundreds of people, including several Hindus, were killed. Community leaders said the killings of the Hindus were largely related to their political affiliation, not their religion.</p><p>But tensions have increased in recent weeks with the arrest of a Hindu monk, Chinmoy Krishna Das, who was accused of denigrating Bangladesh’s flag as he protested for the protection of Hindus.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The monk’s supporters gathered at the court in Chattogram during his bail hearing, clashing with the police. During the unrest, a Muslim lawyer was hacked to death in unclear circumstances.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The police clashing with supporters of a Hindu monk, Chinmoy Krishna Das, in Chattogram, Bangladesh, last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Since then, mobs have arrived in neighborhoods where Hindus live, vandalizing temples and targeting homes. In court, lawyers for the monk were heckled by other lawyers and stopped from defending him, his team said.</p><p>“The local lawyers used phrases like ‘throw him out,’ ‘push him down,’ ‘beat him up,’” said Rabindra Ghosh, 75, a senior lawyer who arrived from Dhaka. “Hearing such words from lawyers, wouldn’t I be a bit terrified?”</p><p>He added, “The current situation has shifted from political to religious tensions.”</p><p>On the outskirts of Dhaka, a family-run Hindu temple was vandalized and set on fire in the predawn hours of Dec. 7. The owner, Ratan Kumar Ghosh, said the local news media had minimized the attack.</p><p>In Chattogram, the premises of three temples were vandalized recently, their gates and windows smashed with rocks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“After the Friday prayers, some people started saying, ‘Go capture and slaughter Hindus,” said Tapan Das, 75, the owner of a house that contains one of the temples.</p><p>“I sent everyone back to their homes,” Mr. Das said. “As the procession came, they banged on the gate and threw stones.”</p><p>At another temple in Chattogram, it was clear that a mob attack had taken place, but accounts of the unrest were inconsistent.</p><p>Indian broadcast media ran grainy footage on Nov. 27 saying the temple had been set ablaze. Ms. Hasina put out a statement saying that a “temple was burned in Chattogram.” But leaders of the Hindu community in Chattogram rejected those accounts, with a temple priest saying that a mob had vandalized two lion statues outside the temple gate.</p><p>An early sign of the politicization of Hindus’ plight came in the days after Ms. Hasina’s fall in August, when an office of her party, the Awami League, was burned. A temple known as Navagraha Bari stood nearby. Videos spread across Indian social media falsely asserting that the temple had been attacked.</p><p>“Some individuals recorded a video of that fire and spread it, claiming that the Navagraha temple was on fire,” said Ujjal Bishwash, 52, a resident of the area. But “there has been no incident of fire at our temple to date.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mujib Mashal is the South Asia bureau chief for The Times, helping to lead coverage of India and the diverse region around it, including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mujib-mashal">More about Mujib Mashal</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>8</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>For Bangladesh Hindus, Exaggerated Violence Muddies Actual Threats<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/muhammad-yunus">Muhammad Yunus</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Turning Allies Into Enemies: </strong>The United States killed its own allies in Afghanistan, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/europe/afghanistan-allies-enemies-nuristan-taliban.html">sabotaging itself in a part of the country</a> where it never needed to be.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gold Drives Both Sides in Sudan’s War: </strong>Famine and ethnic cleansing stalk Sudan. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/africa/sudan-gold-rush-heart-civil-war.html">Yet the gold trade is booming</a>, enriching generals and propelling the fight.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reining In Argentina’s Inflation: </strong>President Javier Milei has been praised inside and outside Argentina for taming the world’s highest inflation rate. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/americas/argentina-president-milei-inflation-economy.html">But his policies have inflicted widespread hardship</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nudging Japan Forward: </strong>In a society used to quiet consensus-building, Tokyo has made bold changes to its defense policy.
