The New York Times confirmed the deaths of at least 46 Wagner fighters and 24 allied Malian soldiers by matching details seen in footage of the corpses, such as uniforms and tattoos, with imagery of the soldiers when they were alive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The loss is Wagner’s largest ever on African soil and one of the deadliest in its entire history, outside Ukraine. Among those killed was Nikita Fedyanin, one of Wagner’s most influential online propagandists, whose death silenced a key platform for cultivating the group’s ruthless image. And the fallout extended to the Russian home front, too, The Times found, as relatives of the mercenaries accused Wagner of failing to tell them that their family members were dead.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/30/video/30vi-wagner-taureg/30vi-wagner-taureg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/30/video/30vi-wagner-taureg/30vi-wagner-taureg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/30/video/30vi-wagner-taureg/30vi-wagner-taureg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="An image of a pickup truck in a dry, hilly landscape.

There they faced at least several hundred separatists largely from the Tuareg ethnic group, who are fighting for independence in the north. The separatists were later joined by Al Qaeda-affiliated Islamist militants, who occasionally partner with them against government forces.</p><p>The following reconstruction of the fighting contains previously unreported details, including the running battle’s precise locations and the way they caused a cascade of setbacks that led to Wagner’s rout. The Times pieced together this moment-by-moment account from clues visible in satellite imagery and battlefield footage, and through interviews with participants and residents of the area.</p><p>The videos depicting the battle were either filmed by separatists or retrieved by them from the cameras of slain Russian mercenaries. The Tuaregs posted the footage online or provided it directly to The Times. In each case, The Times verified the authenticity of what this imagery depicted.</p><p>Neither Wagner nor the Malian government or military responded to The Times’s requests for comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A still frame from a Wagner mercenary’s body camera footage, posted widely online by separatists, showed him helping carry a crate of ammunition during the battle.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Beyond being a major strategic setback, the defeat undermined one of Wagner’s key pitches for luring men from Russia to fight in Africa: <a href="https://nordsint.org/2024/04/04/remote-destinations-how-the-wagner-group-recruits-for-african-operations/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the promise</a> of an exotic location far safer and more lucrative than the battlefields of Ukraine, where the group has suffered tremendous losses.</p><p>Until July, that was largely true. Wagner mercenaries have operated with near impunity, looting villages and committing scores of atrocities against civilians, including torture, executions and sexual violence, according to an earlier <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/world/africa/mali-massacre-investigation.html" title="">Times investigation</a>, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/03/28/mali-army-wagner-group-atrocities-against-civilians" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">human rights groups</a> and <a href="https://www.state.gov/the-wagner-groups-atrocities-in-africa-lies-and-truth/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Western</a> and African governments.</p><p>“It’s easier for them to go around massacring villagers in the center of Mali,” said Alexander Thurston, an expert on the Sahel region who teaches at the University of Cincinnati. “It’s much harder for them to fight pretty tough people in the desert.”</p><h2 id="link-550bef8a">The Battle of Tinzaouaten</h2><p>About 1,500 Wagner mercenaries arrived in Mali nearly three years ago to fight alongside the country’s military against jihadist groups affiliated with Al Qaeda. Mali soon ejected thousands of French troops, who had also been combating those militants, amid souring relations with Paris.</p><p>Mali’s leaders further expelled United Nations peacekeepers who were helping to maintain a fragile truce between the government and Tuareg separatists. When only Russian mercenaries were left, Mali’s mandate for Wagner expanded to quashing that separatist rebellion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In July, the mercenaries and the Malian soldiers set their eyes on one of the separatist’s remote strongholds, the town of Tinzaouaten, on the border with Algeria.</p><p>As a convoy of about two dozen vehicles made its way north carrying the soldiers, Mr. Fedyanin, the Wagner propagandist, turned on his body camera.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In an undated photograph obtained by The New York Times, Nikita Fedyanin rides in what appears to be a Malian military truck.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Fedyanin, 29, was the administrator of the Grey Zone, a Telegram channel that flooded more than 500,000 subscribers with content promoting Wagner’s ruthless image and glorifying atrocities.

Another fighter’s message read: “I’m not afraid to die. What hurts me is that everything ends this way — disgracefully, surrounded, and I’ll forever remain on this African soil.”</p><p>That same day, Tuareg separatists and Islamist insurgents began posting footage of the burning convoy with dozens of bodies of Russian mercenaries and Malian soldiers lying out in the open.</p><p>In addition to the fatalities, two Russians and nine Malians were captured by the separatists, and 12 of the corpses in footage from the scene were unidentifiable.
