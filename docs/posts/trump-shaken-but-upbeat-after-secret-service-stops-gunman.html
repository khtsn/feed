    <h1>Trump Shaken but Upbeat After Secret Service Stops Gunman</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Trump had been playing golf with his friend and campaign donor, the real estate investor Steve Witkoff, around 1:30 p.m. when gunshots rang out. Mr. Trump was between the fifth and sixth holes and Secret Service agents were traveling ahead of him, scoping out potential threats on the course. An agent had spotted the barrel of a semiautomatic rifle poking through the bushes. The agent opened fire on the man, who escaped in his car before being caught by police later, law enforcement officials said.</p><p>Mr. Trump gave his own renditions of the episode to advisers and allies. Mr. Trump’s friend, the Fox News host Sean Hannity, went on air to deliver dramatic eyewitness accounts he said he received from both Mr. Trump and Mr. Witkoff.</p><p>“They were on the fifth hole, they were about to go up to putt,” Mr. Hannity <a href="https://x.com/TVNewsNow/status/1835397310966088164" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on Fox News on Sunday. He added that they heard “pop, pop, pop, pop,” before the Secret Service pounced on top of the former president to protect him and a steel-reinforced car whisked him away.</p><p>Mr. Trump was later taken back to Mar-a-Lago, his private club and home in Palm Beach.</p><p>Mr. Trump joked to allies on Sunday afternoon that he was disappointed not to be able to finish his putt, and lamented that he had been set to shoot under par.</p><p>Mr. Hannity said that Mr. Trump told him, “I was even and I had a birdie putt.”</p><p>Mr. Trump’s senior political advisers were not with him when the plot was foiled and some were shaken when they first heard about it and tried to piece together what had happened.</p></div></div>
