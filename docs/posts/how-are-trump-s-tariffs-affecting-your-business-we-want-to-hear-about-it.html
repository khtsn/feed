China is, by far, the biggest exporter, but its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/business/trump-tariffs-apec-trade.html" title="">neighbors like Vietnam, Japan, India, and Taiwan</a> are major sellers to America’s consumers and partners with their companies.</p><p>President Trump believes he can force more goods to be made at home by raising taxes on American imports. He imposed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/business/nissan-kanda-japan-factory.html" title="">new tariffs on cars</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/politics/trump-tariffs-steel-aluminum.html" title="">steel and aluminum</a>. His particularly steep tariffs on China prompted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/business/china-tariffs-125.html" title="">an escalation that blocked most trade</a> between the countries. He also placed new “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/02/business/trump-tariffs-liberation-day" title="">reciprocal tariffs</a>” on China and dozens of other countries.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/business/trump-tariffs-stock-markets.htmlhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/business/trump-tariffs-stock-markets.html" title="">Financial markets recoiled</a>, and Mr. Trump paused most, but not all, of his tariffs. He said he wanted time to negotiate trade agreements with all the countries. Then he said he wouldn’t have time and would instead send letters to countries telling them what their final tariff would be. Deadlines loom for when tariffs might snap back: in August for a deal with China, and July for the other countries.</p><p>We are a team of reporters who write about trade and economic issues for The New York Times, focusing on China and Asia and how geopolitical issues affect companies, businesses and people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>To better understand the global impact of the trade war, we would like to hear from business owners, entrepreneurs, managers and employees.
