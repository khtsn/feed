    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The race to electrify America’s cars is looking more like a slog these days. In the past few months, several automakers announced plans to pull back on introducing new electric models or have scaled back some of their decarbonization goals.</p><p>This week, Volvo said it was revising its plans to have an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volvo-cars-scales-back-electric-vehicle-ambition-2024-09-04/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">all-electric fleet</a> by 2030. In August, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/business/economy/ford-ev-plant-delay.html" title="">Ford announced it was slowing down</a> the pace of its investments in new battery-powered models. Also last month, General Motors said that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/gm-delays-indiana-battery-factory-in-latest-ev-pullback-e0d53b9c" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it would delay plans</a> for a new Buick E.V., an electric truck factory and a new battery plant. And in February, Mercedes-Benz moved its electrification goal back <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/mercedes-benz-hits-cars-returns-forecast-inflation-supply-chain-costs-bite-2024-02-22/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by five years, to 2030.</a></p><p>The list goes on.</p><p>So does the latest news threaten U.S. ambitions of cleaning up its transportation sector, which is the single largest driver of the country’s carbon emissions?</p><p>Not in the long-term, according to experts. Some of the recent announcements aren’t substantial retreats, for one. Volvo now says that its fleet will be 90 to 100 percent electric by 2030, for example.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here is one thing to keep in mind as you think about the latest news on automakers’ plans: “There’s still a consensus among carmakers that everything will go electric,” The Times’s Jack Ewing, who has covered the auto industry for 40 years, told me. “It’s just a question of how long it’s going to take.”</p><h3 id="link-361bb536"><span><strong>Less pressure</strong></span></h3><p>There are a few reasons that help explain these recent announcements of less ambitious E.V. goals, Ewing told me. First, sales aren’t growing as fast as they were last year. In 2023, E.V. sales increased by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/climate/inflation-reduction-act-progress-climate.html" title="">over 50 percent</a> from the year before. In the first half of this year, according to <a href="https://www.anl.gov/sites/www/files/2024-08/Total%20Sales%20for%20Website_July%202024.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">government data</a>, they are up about 10 percent.</p><p>That’s partly because gasoline-powered cars are still cheaper than E.V.s and many of the more affluent consumers who were first in line to go electric have already made their purchases, experts say.</p><p>Then there is regulation, Coral Davenport, who covers climate policy for The Times, told me. Early last year, the Biden administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/12/climate/biden-electric-cars-epa.html" title="">proposed a rule</a> with strong emissions restrictions on new passenger cars that would push the industry to gradually increase the share of electric vehicles in their fleets until an estimated two-thirds of new passenger cars it sold were gasoline-free by 2032.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/12/climate/biden-electric-cars-epa.html" title="">when the rule was finalized</a> this year, the speed of the pollution-reduction goals was relaxed. That means that even though companies still have to reduce the pollution of their fleets to the same levels by 2032, they don’t have to rush.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The short-term pressure is off,” Davenport told me.</p><p>Overall, the U.S. is still on track to meet its emissions reduction goals in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/climate/inflation-reduction-act-progress-climate.html" title="">transportation sector</a>, but it may take longer to get there. Each year of delay, Davenport noted, means millions more gasoline-powered cars on the road polluting the atmosphere, and that will have a steep climate cost.</p><h3 id="link-1c6edab8"><span><strong>A slower, but steady pace</strong></span></h3><p>Still, the experts I talked to were fairly optimistic about the future of the E.V. market, despite the negative headlines.</p><p>Sales may not be growing as fast as they were last year. But they are still growing. And investments in new factories that produce electric cars are growing, too, as well as the jobs they generate.</p><p>According to <a href="https://library.edf.org/AssetLink/07l26xtk0xv2bw713c64na3g5g1kmbb7.pdf?_gl=1*3zf4da*_gcl_au*OTk2MDcxNDg5LjE3MjI5NzI1NDg.*_ga*MTk3NDc4MzQ3NS4xNjMyODU4NDY0*_ga_2B3856Y9QW*MTcyNTQ4MDAzMC4zMjMuMS4xNzI1NDgwMDQ2LjQ0LjAuMA..*_ga_Q5CTTQBJD8*MTcyNTQ4MDAzMC4zMjEuMS4xNzI1NDgwMDQ2LjQ0LjAuMA.." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a report by</a> the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group, over the past nine years, manufacturers have announced $199 billion in investments that come with over 200,000 new jobs.</p><p>The vast majority of those investments were announced in the last two or three years, after the Biden administration signed its climate and infrastructure laws.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>By 2027, the manufacturing facilities in the works now will be able to produce 5.8 million new electric cars a year, accounting for over a third of America’s annual demand, the report found.</p><p>Peter Zalzal, a lawyer who works in transportation at E.D.F., said the investments his team has been tracking show no sign of waning. This means that the data still show automakers are confident the future is electric. “As costs continue to decline, as we see more of these manufacturing facilities come online, the picture is just going to improve,” he said.</p><h3 id="link-3bb08144"><span><strong>A looming tipping point</strong></span></h3><p>It’s hard to know exactly why individual companies decided to pull back on their plans. But experts told me that a broader trend is clear: Electric vehicles are approaching a tipping point when they’ll reach price parity with gas-powered cars.</p><p>A <a href="https://theicct.org/publication/ev-cost-benefits-2035-oct22/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report by the International Council on Clean Transportation</a>, a research nonprofit group, estimates that E.V.s with 400-mile range could reach price parity with gas vehicles sometime between 2029 and 2033. (<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1221-january-17-2022-model-year-2021-all-electric-vehicles-had-median#:~:text=For%20the%202021%20model%20year,ranges%20have%20been%20increasing%20rapidly." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The median range for gasoline cars</a> is 400 miles.)</p><p>For cars with tighter ranges, parity will happen faster. (The median range for a 2023 model year E.V. in the U.S. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1323-january-1-2024-top-range-model-year-2023-evs-was-516-miles-single" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is 270 miles</a>, though some models can do almost double that.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In June, the average price of a new electric car or pickup was $56,371, according to estimates by Cox Automotive, compared with $48,644 for all vehicles, Ewing reported. Many people, he noted, will recoup that value with lower maintenance and fuel costs. (If you want to crunch the numbers on buying an E.V., Ewing has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/climate/electric-cars-ev-battery-value.html" title="">an excellent guide here</a>.)</p><p>“We have all of the policy tools and the building blocks in place that enable widespread and accelerated transition to E.V.s in the United States,” said Peter Slowik, who follows the passenger vehicle industry for the International Council on Clean Transportation.</p><p>Consumer surveys suggest that the E.V. industry has a lot of room to grow. One example: Electric vehicles accounted for 8.5 percent of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/06/climate/hybrid-electric-vehicle-popular.html" title="">new registrations last year</a>, but a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/07/13/how-americans-view-electric-vehicles/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2023 survey</a> by the Pew Research Center shows a much larger share of Americans, 38 percent, say they are very or somewhat likely to buy one.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A group surveys the vegetation at a solar farm in Ramsey, Minn.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tim Gruber for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-2fa5c332">Solar farms have a superpower beyond clean energy</h2><p>It’s not your average solar farm.</p><p>The glassy panels stand in a meadow. Wildflowers sway in the breeze, bursts of purple, pink, yellow, orange and white among native grasses. A monarch butterfly flits from one blossom to the next. Dragonflies zip, bees hum and goldfinches trill.</p><p>As solar projects unfurl across the U.S., <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/climate/solar-power-pollinators-wildlife.html" title="">sites like this one in Ramsey, Minn.</a>, northwest of Minneapolis, stand out because they offer a way to fight climate change while also tackling another ecological crisis: a global biodiversity collapse, driven in large part by habitat loss.</p><p>The sun’s clean energy is a powerful weapon in the battle against climate change. But the sites that capture that energy take up land that wildlife needs to survive and thrive. Solar farms could blanket millions of acres in the United States over the coming decades.</p><p>So developers, operators, biologists and environmentalists are teaming up with an innovative strategy. — <em>Catrin Einhorn</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Manuela Andreoni is a Times climate and environmental reporter and a writer for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/climate-fwd">Climate Forward</a> newsletter.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div>
