News deserts are growing across the country, and over half of counties in the United States now have <a href="https://www.medill.northwestern.edu/news/2023/more-than-half-of-us-counties-have-no-access-or-very-limited-access-to-local-news.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">just one or no remaining news outlet</a>.</p><p>But in San Francisco, local news is seeing a resurgence thanks to a willingness to experiment. Half-century-old neighborhood news organizations are becoming nonprofits. Others are banking on the help of deep-pocketed supporters. And as local news driven by advertising revenue declines, news sites are relying on subscriptions to fill in the gaps.</p><p>A city of roughly 800,000 residents, San Francisco now boasts 27 news organizations, ranging from hyperlocal nonprofits and radio stations to billionaire-backed outlets like <a href="https://sfstandard.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The San Francisco Standard</a> vying to become the city’s paper of record. Unusual for a major American city, San Francisco has about the same number of media outlets today that it did a decade ago.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Standard is backed by a tech billionaire who is active in local politics.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>“Virtually every type of news model out there exists in the Bay Area,” said Bill Nagel, publisher of The San Francisco Chronicle, the city’s largest newspaper. “It’s a hypercompetitive environment.”</p></div><div><div><p>There are a few reasons the region can support so much news. The technology industry has made the Bay Area one of the wealthiest places in the country, and that wealth supports local news through donations large and small. It is also a highly educated region, which <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/09/12/who-pays-for-local-news-in-the-u-s/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">typically correlates</a> to paid news readership.</p><p>It helps, too, that there is lots of news to report on and read about in San Francisco, from local political stars like Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi and Gavin Newsom to <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/07/11/nudists-save-tourist-attack-castro/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nudist good Samaritans</a>, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2024/cruise-sf-collision-timeline/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">driverless car crashes</a> and contentious local politics.</p><p>“San Francisco is rare, because many big cities in this country don’t really have the resources necessary to fund these things, whether it’s big companies to advertise in a for-profit paper, or wealthy individuals or foundations to fund nonprofit journalism,” said Evan Smith, a co-founder of The Texas Tribune and an adviser at the Emerson Collective, which helps nonprofit newsrooms find funding. “And there isn’t enough talent in a lot of places to actually stand one of these up and to operate it.”</p><p>While the longevity of new business models remains to be seen, they provide a much needed alternative to online advertising, which has been absorbed by Silicon Valley tech giants like Google and Meta, whose headquarters are an hour’s drive to the south of San Francisco.</p></div></div><div><div><p>California newspapers have been <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-07-24/here-are-five-charts-that-explain-californias-struggling-news-industry" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hit especially hard</a>. From 2019 to 2023, online and print circulation for the Sunday editions of seven of the state’s largest newspapers declined 30 percent, according to data from the Alliance for Audited Media.</p><p>But circulation for The San Francisco Chronicle increased 18 percent over the same period. The paper currently has around 150,000 paying digital subscribers, Mr. Nagel said.</p><p>Not all of the city’s newspapers have fared as well. Circulation for The San Francisco Examiner, owned by the real estate baron Clint Reilly, declined 40 percent from 2020 to 2022, according to advertising data. And the head count of working journalists in the city has been declining for decades.</p><p>As for-profit news outlets owned by hedge funds and newspaper chains shrink, nonprofit newsrooms have grown in their place. The nonprofit model gives newsrooms access to a national network of grants from journalism foundations, and the ability for readers to make tax-deductible donations. The trade-off is they can’t make endorsements or be sold to a for-profit company.</p><p>Among them in San Francisco is Mission Local, which has been an independent newsroom since 2014 and is run by Lydia Chávez and Joe Eskenazi, two veterans of Bay Area media.</p></div></div><div><p>Operating out of a 700-square-foot office in the city’s Mission District, Mission Local gets 75 percent of its revenue from reader donations, Ms. Chávez said. Its current staff of three editors and six reporters, along with five summer interns, is the largest it has ever been. Mr. Eskenazi compared the ethos of Mission Local to alt-weekly newspapers that used to thrive in San Francisco but have mostly disappeared.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mission Local receives 75 percent of its revenue from reader donations.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mission Local has a tight focus on neighborhood news.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lydia Chávez, a veteran Bay Area journalist, is the executive editor of Mission Local.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>“It wasn’t the journalistic model that led to the demise of alt-weeklies, it was the advertising model,” Mr. Eskenazi said. The nonprofit model “better allows for readers and donors to support us.”</p></div><div><div><p>Other local outlets are trying to emulate that success. The San Francisco Bay View, a historically Black newspaper, reincorporated as a nonprofit in May, said Kevin Epps, its executive editor.</p><p>The change marked a stark departure for The Bay View, which has relied on advertising since its founding in 1976, back when Mr. Epps delivered its copies as a 10-year-old paper carrier.</p><p>“San Francisco is an epicenter of alternative media, and I think that’s sort of reflective of why the journalism here is still able to somewhat fare better than other places,” Mr. Epps said. “But we have to find other streams of revenue.”</p><p>A recent addition to the city’s media market is <a href="https://sf.gazetteer.co/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gazetteer SF</a>, an upstart only a few months old that has no social media accounts, actively delists its articles from Google search and markets itself via paper fliers stapled to telephone poles around the city.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Unusual for a major American city, San Francisco has about the same number of media outlets today as it did a decade ago.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>Byron Perry, the founder of Gazetteer, said its goal is to reach 12,000 paid subscribers in the next two years, with each customer paying around $7 a month to receive articles mostly through email and text blasts.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Byron Perry, the founder of Gazetteer SF, has taken a novel approach to reaching readers that doesn’t depend on Google.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>As news outlets increasingly lean on donations and philanthropy, some residents worry that local power brokers are trying to use the media to shape local politics.</p><p>Since its inception in 2021, The Standard has been funded by Michael Moritz, a billionaire venture capitalist and former journalist.</p><p>Mr. Moritz’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/26/opinion/san-francisco-democrats-board-of-supervisors.html" title="">outspoken criticism of city leadership</a> has caused some rivals to question The Standard’s editorial independence. He has spent over <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-15/sequoia-s-moritz-bets-300-million-on-reshaping-san-francisco" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$300 million</a> on social and political causes in the city, and The Standard’s chief executive, Griffin Gaffney, was a former organizer at TogetherSF, a political action committee financed by Mr. Moritz that is politically moderate by San Francisco standards.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“Michael is very active in the community,” Mr. Gaffney said over email. “But his political activity and philanthropic work is separate from the Standard.”</p><p>The outlet has lured talented journalists with high pay — a recent job posting for a reporting position had a salary range of $110,000 to $170,000 — and its coverage of city politics is well regarded, including its investigations into <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/07/01/mark-farrell-campaign-money-san-francisco-restaurants-bars/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">campaign finance violations</a>. The Standard also plans to roll out a new subscription service later this year, Mr. Gaffney said.</p><p>“We started The Standard because San Francisco deserves a top-notch publication,” he said. “And yet our one major publication is run by a lumbering media conglomerate based in New York,” he added, referring to Hearst, the owner of The Chronicle.</p><p>Mr. Nagel said The Chronicle had been successfully run out of San Francisco for the last 160 years. “In an era of news deserts, we welcome newcomers with the right intentions to the fray,” he said.</p><p>Other tech money has also flowed from political action committees to independent journalists. Neighbors for a Better San Francisco, a prominent local PAC, has donated at least $200,000 to independent journalists in recent years, according to financial filings and interviews. The PAC is also moderate by local standards.</p></div></div><div><div><p>It’s unclear if business models that work for news in San Francisco could be as successful elsewhere. Nonprofit newsrooms have found their footing everywhere from rural Mississippi to inner-city Chicago, and some even <a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/sarah-conway-city-bureau-and-trina-reynolds-tyler-invisible-institute" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">won Pulitzer Prizes</a> this spring. But fund-raising for nonprofits can vary from year to year, especially in less wealthy regions.</p><p>“It’s still a struggle,” Ms. Chávez said. “We worry about raising money every day.”</p><p>In Baltimore, the nonprofit <a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Baltimore Banner</a> has grown to rival the incumbent Baltimore Sun thanks to funding from Stewart Bainum Jr., a hotel magnate and philanthropist. But for outlets like The Banner and The Standard that rely heavily on the support of a single financier to get off the ground, longevity is a concern.</p><p>In 2010, the billionaire Warren Hellman started a newspaper in San Francisco called The Bay Citizen, but it merged with another news organization in 2012 shortly after his death.</p><p>“It shows one of the hazards of what I call the ‘billionaire behind the curtain’ model,” said Jonathan Weber, a former editor in chief of The Bay Citizen and the first editor in chief of The Standard. “And it’s a big one.”</p></div></div><div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eli Tan is a reporter covering the technology industry and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eli-tan">More about Eli Tan</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/the-san-francisco-chronicle">The San Francisco Chronicle</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/08/16/technology/san-francisco-local-news-resurgence.html">5</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/08/16/technology/san-francisco-local-news-resurgence.html">5</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>From Online Hate to Real-World Violence: </strong>Social media posts assailing immigrants have fomented a climate of fear and hatred in Britain, Portugal and other countries. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/09/technology/migrants-racism-social-media-violence.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">The vitriol is now spilling onto the streets</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bari Weiss Knows What She’s Doing: </strong>The founder of The Free Press has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/business/media/bari-weiss-free-press.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">built a new media empire</a> by persuading audiences that she is a teller of dangerous truths.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reviving Downtown San Francisco: </strong>The city, which is among those most devastated in the United States after the pandemic, is trying to lure businesses back with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/business/san-francisco-storefronts-free-rent.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">free rent for up to six months</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>How to Not Get Scammed: </strong>Online schemes get more sophisticated all the time. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/business/online-scams-advice.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">Here’s how to protect yourself and what to do if you get duped</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Skirting A.I.
