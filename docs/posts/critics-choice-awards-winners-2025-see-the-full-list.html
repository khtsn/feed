That’s where we love to see films. Let’s see films in our local theaters, OK?”</p><p>The Critics Choice ceremony, initially scheduled for Jan. 12, was postponed for several weeks because of the Los Angeles wildfires. This put the show, which was held in the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, Calif., in an unusual position: Voting had already concluded on Jan. 10, meaning the weeks that followed — marked by major events including the announcement of the Oscar nominations and a controversy over inflammatory tweets that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/movies/emilia-perez-oscars-scandal.html" title="">engulfed “Emilia Pérez” and its star Karla Sofía Gascón</a> — had no impact on the results.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Gascón, who is under fire for posts that denigrated Muslims, George Floyd and the Oscars, was a no-show at the ceremony, though her co-star Zoe Saldaña, who won the supporting actress trophy, and the film’s director, Jacques Audiard, who accepted the foreign language film award, were both in attendance. “Emilia Pérez” also picked up a third trophy, for best original song.</p><p>Ms. Gascón ultimately lost the best actress award to Demi Moore (“The Substance”), who won her second major televised prize after triumphing at the Golden Globes last month. The best actor award went to the “Brutalist” star Adrien Brody, furthering a comeback for the 51-year-old Mr. Brody, who has struggled to match his early success in the 2002 film “The Pianist,” for which he won the Oscar.</p><p>In his acceptance speech, Mr. Brody said, “I’ve been doing this since I was 12, so I know very clearly that these moments are far and few between in an actor’s life, and I do not take this for granted.”</p><p>As he paused, a man in the audience shouted, “Lately, you’ve been doing great!”</p><p>Onstage, Mr. Brody brightened. “‘Lately!’ I appreciate it,” he said.</p><p>The other major film trophies went to Kieran Culkin (“A Real Pain”) for best supporting actor and the “Wicked” director Jon M. Chu. Before Mr. Chu was announced as the winner, the award’s presenter, Orlando Bloom, told the crowd that the Critics Choice winner for best director often goes on to claim the same Oscar.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Chu, who was not even nominated in the best director category at the Academy Awards, opened his acceptance speech with a joke: “I’m going to win that Oscar!” he exclaimed, hoisting his award in the air.</p><p>Here is the full list of winners:</p><h2 id="link-197aa">Film</h2><p><strong>Best Picture</strong></p><p>“Anora”</p><p><strong>Best Actor</strong></p><p>Adrien Brody, “The Brutalist”</p><p><strong>Best Actress</strong></p><p>Demi Moore, “The Substance”</p><p><strong>Best Supporting Actor</strong></p><p>Kieran Culkin, “A Real Pain”</p><p><strong>Best Supporting Actress</strong></p><p>Zoe Saldaña, “Emilia Pérez”</p><p><strong>Best Young Actor or Actress</strong></p><p>Maisy Stella, “My Old Ass”</p><p><strong>Best Acting Ensemble</strong></p><p>“Conclave”</p><p><strong>Best Director</strong></p><p>Jon M.
