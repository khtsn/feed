Not anymore. I am proud to announce that we are going to give the power back to the people who read your papers, who watch your television shows and who listen to your radio stations. Moving forward, the White House press pool will be determined by the White House press team. Legacy outlets who have participated in the press pool for decades will still be allowed to join — fear not. But we will also be offering the privilege to well-deserving outlets who have never been allowed to share in this awesome responsibility. Just like we added a new media seat in this briefing room, legacy media outlets who have been here for years will still participate in the pool, but new voices are going to be welcomed in as well. A select group of D.C.-based journalists should no longer have a monopoly over the privilege of press access at the White House. All journalists, outlets and voices deserve a seat at this highly coveted table. So by deciding which outlets make up the limited press pool on a day-to-day basis, the White House will be restoring power back to the American people who President Trump was elected to serve.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/25/multimedia/25trump-news-press-pool-02-qwcm/25trump-news-press-pool-02-qwcm-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, announced on Tuesday that the Trump administration will now choose which media outlets can access the presidential pool.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Tuesday’s announcement was the latest in a string of aggressive efforts by the Trump administration to erode the access and influence of major news organizations that cover the White House. It is a sharp break from generations of Republican and Democratic presidents who abided by the White House press corps’ deciding on its own which reporters were granted more access.</p><p>The administration has barred reporters from The Associated Press, which supplies information to thousands of news organizations around the world, from entering the Oval Office or traveling on Air Force One, prompting a legal battle.</p><p>The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said the new policy was intended to allow “new media” outlets — such as digital sites, streaming services and podcasts — “to share in this awesome responsibility.” She added, “Legacy media outlets who have been here for years will still participate in the pool, but new voices are going to be welcomed in as well.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The White House Correspondents’ Association rebuked the move in a blistering statement.</p><p>“This move tears at the independence of a free press in the United States,” wrote Eugene Daniels, a Politico reporter and the president of the association. “It suggests the government will choose the journalists who cover the president. In a free country, leaders must not be able to choose their own press corps.”</p><p>The association said that it had been given no warning of Ms. Leavitt’s announcement and that there had been no prior discussions about it with the White House. “The W.H.C.A. will never stop advocating for comprehensive access, full transparency and the right of the American public to read, listen to and watch reports from the White House, delivered without fear or favor,” Mr. Daniels wrote.</p><p>The Trump administration recently added <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/business/media/white-house-press-briefing-podcasters-influencers.html" title="">a “new media” seat</a> in the White House briefing room. In recent weeks, the seat has been occupied by some journalists who strive for accuracy and fairness, such as reporters at Axios and Semafor, and by partisan figures who are sympathetic to the Trump administration, such as the podcast host Sage Steele.</p><p>In announcing its plans for the press pool, Ms. Leavitt said that “by deciding which outlets make up the limited press pool on a day-to-day basis, the White House will be restoring power back to the American people.”</p><p>Jacqui Heinrich, a senior White House correspondent at Fox News, responded to that remark on social media, <a href="https://x.com/JacquiHeinrich/status/1894476539825459580" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writing</a>: “This move does not give the power back to the people — it gives power to the White House.” Ms. Heinrich is a board member of the correspondents’ association.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The White House’s attitude toward a news outlet is often predicated on whether its coverage fits the administration’s agenda.</p><p>President Trump’s dispute with The A.P. is based on the news agency’s decision to continue using the name “Gulf of Mexico” to refer to the body of water that Mr. Trump decreed “Gulf of America.” Most of the Gulf of Mexico lies outside the maritime regions controlled by the United States.</p><p>At Tuesday’s briefing, however, Ms. Leavitt cited reporting by The A.P. — approvingly. She highlighted A.P. articles about migrants who had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/panama-united-states-migration-trump-beb125ce0ecbebb2895ea9dd18c4c53b" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decided not</a> to pursue their journeys to the United States.</p><p>A First Amendment advocacy group, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said on Tuesday that the move represented “a drastic change in how the public obtains information about its government.”</p><p>“The White House press pool exists to serve the public, not the presidency,” said the group’s president, Bruce D. Brown.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael M. Grynbaum writes about the intersection of media, politics and culture.
