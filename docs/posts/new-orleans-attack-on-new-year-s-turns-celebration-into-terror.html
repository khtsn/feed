In an instant the city’s best-known, most popular public space was transformed into a scene of death and terror.</p><p>“We heard him punch the gas and then the impact and then the screams,” said Kimberly Stricklin, of Mobile, Ala., who watched with her husband as the truck careened onto Bourbon Street and slammed into the crowd. “It just took a moment to register, it was just so frightening — it was like something out of a horror movie.”</p><p>Mrs. Stricklin said she was haunted by the memory of the sounds one victim had made. “I can’t get over that girl’s screams,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Described by federal authorities as a deliberate act of terror, the attack killed at least 15 people, injured about three dozen others and left New Orleans, a city of 364,000, on edge; investigators said at a news conference on Wednesday that they believed that the driver did not act alone.</p><p>The driver, who was killed in a shootout with police, was identified by the F.B.I. as Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar, 42, a U.S. citizen and U.S. Army veteran from Texas.<span>  </span>He had loaded his rented truck with weapons and at least one “potential” improvised explosive, authorities said, and an Islamic State flag was found on the trailer hitch of his rented white Ford pickup.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Investigators work the scene of the attack in New Orleans.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gerald Herbert/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>President Biden, in a short address at Camp David, said that the F.B.I. told him that the driver had posted videos on social media “mere hours” before the attack “indicating that he was inspired” by the Islamic State.</p><p>As law enforcement officers swept through the French Quarter searching out suspicious packages and other potential threats and evidence on Wednesday, authorities urged the public to send tips to aid in the investigation, and vowed to track down everyone involved in the attack.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“We have a plan, we know what to do, and we will get these people,” Anne Kirkpatrick, the New Orleans police superintendent, said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>For residents watching the events unfold, the day felt both frightening and surreal. Brian O’Brien, 57, a tour guide who lives a block from Bourbon Street, said he woke on Wednesday to find a state trooper inspecting a cooler sitting about 100 feet from his stoop. According to Mr. O’Brien, the officer had said the cooler contained pipes, tape and lots of nails, and a bomb squad arrived soon after to detonate the contents.</p><p>Mr. O’Brien recalled hearing a shout of “Fire in the hole!” while he sat, with his ears covered, at a safe distance. “I’m still in shock,” he said.</p><p>Two officers were injured when police exchanged gunfire with the suspect after he had crashed and exited his truck; both officers survived.</p><p>The Sugar Bowl, part of the new 12-team college football championship, had drawn tens of thousands of spectators to New Orleans and was scheduled to be played on Wednesday night at the Superdome, less than a mile from Bourbon Street. It was postponed until Thursday in the wake of the attack.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The victims included Ni’Kyra Cheyenne Dedeaux, 18, of Gulfport, Miss., who was set to start nursing school this month; Reggie Hunter, 37, a warehouse manager from Baton Rouge, La., and father of two; and Tiger Bech, a standout Louisiana high school athlete who played college football at Princeton.</p><p>“Love you always brother!,” Jack Bech, Mr. Bech’s brother and a football player at Texas Christian University, wrote in a social media post about his family’s loss. “You inspired me everyday now you get to be with me in every moment.”</p><p>Dr. Dwight McKenna, the New Orleans coroner, said in an interview Wednesday evening that the number of fatalities could continue to increase in the days ahead.</p><p>The attack happened near the intersection of Bourbon Street and Canal Street, on one of the busiest blocks in New Orleans, on one of the busiest nights of the year. Witnesses said the white pickup truck had sped around the corner from Canal onto Bourbon, easily breaking through or evading whatever modest barriers stood in its way.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-9"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="new-orleans-attack-locator" data-id="100000009903690" data-source-id="100000009903690"><div slug="new-orleans-attack-locator" data-sourceid="100000009903690" id="embed-id-100000009903690">

Records showed that he had been married twice, and had reported financial problems to his ex-wife’s lawyer in 2022.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Before the authorities identified the driver as an American citizen and U.S. Army veteran, some early reports suggested the vehicle had come across the border from Mexico. President-elect Donald J. Trump quickly asserted on social media that his condemnations of undocumented immigrants had been validated.</p><p>“When I said that the criminals coming in are far worse than the criminals we have in our country, that statement was constantly refuted by Democrats and the Fake News Media, but it turned out to be true,” Mr. Trump said on his website, Truth Social. </p><p>Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said federal investigators were treating the attack as an act of terrorism. The use of the truck as a weapon, along with the discovery of an improvised bomb in a cooler near the crashed vehicle, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/us/new-orleans-truck-attack-terrorism-fbi.html?smid=url-share" title="">led officials to conclude</a> that the driver’s goal had been to inflict civilian casualties.</p><p>“My heart is broken for those who began their year by learning people they love were killed in this horrific attack,” Mr. Garland said. He vowed to “deploy every available resource” to the investigation.</p><p>A compact neighborhood, just 6 by 13 blocks, tucked along the curving bank of the Mississippi River, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/us/french-quarter-tourist-attraction.html?smid=url-share" title="">the French Quarter is famous</a> for its distinctive architecture, ornate balconies, European flair and late-night party scene. Vibrant festivals on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/09/travel/things-to-do-new-orleans.html" title="">Bourbon Street,</a> where the attack took place, attract revelers from around the world.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“You’re talking about one of the most iconic cities, and one of the most recognizable streets in the world,” Oliver Thomas, a New Orleans city councilman, said on Wednesday after the attack. “So when you think about it, this isn’t really a message and a shot at New Orleans. This is at America.”</p><p>Video clips posted by witnesses on social media showed Bourbon Street emptied of crowds, who had fled as the attack unfolded. Bodies of victims lay sprawled in the street, near gutters littered with empty cups and broken strands of colorful Mardi Gras beads. Stunned bystanders looked down from second-floor balconies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Sugar Bowl was scheduled to be played on Wednesday night, but was postponed until Thursday in the wake of the attack.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chris Graythen/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The attack, by an assailant “set on hurting as many people as he could,” had targeted an area where crowds can be found at any hour, said Jason Williams, the district attorney who represents New Orleans.</p><p>“New Orleans is a place that doesn’t close,” Mr. Williams said, adding: “There’s always people, there’s always people out.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>This year’s Sugar Bowl, between the University of Georgia and Notre Dame, had been expected to bring as many as 100,000 people to the city, organizers said.</p><p>A University of Georgia student was among those critically injured in the attack, the school’s president said in a statement. The president, Jere W. Morehead, did not disclose the student’s name but said he had spoken to the family.</p><p>New Orleans is also preparing to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5713560/2024/09/01/new-orleans-saints-stadium-guide-caesars-superdome/" title="">host the Super Bowl</a> at the Superdome on Feb. 9, another event expected to attract hundreds of thousands of visitors to the city.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/01/us/new-orleans-vehicle-crash#new-orleans-vehicle-crash" title="">incident</a> was the latest in a long succession of vehicle-based attacks on crowds, some dating back decades.
