href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-philadelphi-corridor-gaza.html" title="">border area</a> to prevent Hamas from smuggling weapons into the Gaza Strip from Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula. He has cast control of the Philadelphi Corridor, as the border zone is known, as a matter of existential importance for Israel, though some Israeli politicians believe he is using the issue to avoid reaching a deal for a cease-fire and the release of hostages.</p><p>Egypt argues that it has already cracked down on smuggling there — because doing so serves its own security interests, not just Israel’s — by building barriers, destroying tunnels and patrolling the area. For Cairo, accepting Israeli troops on the border would threaten its own national security and draw criticism from the Egyptian public, analysts say.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli soldiers driving along the Philadelphi corridor in June, photographed while on a tour area with the Israel Defense Forces.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ronen Bergman/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The increasingly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/world/middleeast/egypt-corridor-israel-gaza-border.html" title="">bitter dispute</a> has destabilized the once strong security partnership between Egypt and Israel, whose landmark 1979 peace treaty has been a linchpin of Middle East geopolitics for decades.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Here’s a look at the issue.</p><h2 id="link-7a886524">What has Hamas been able to smuggle through the border?</h2><p>Exactly how much Hamas has been able to smuggle into Gaza via the Gaza-Egypt border — above ground or through tunnels — is unknown.</p><p>The question has come underfierce debate even in Israel: Some Israelis — who want to see an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/world/middleeast/israel-protests-hostages.html" title="">agreement reached</a> to free Israeli hostages — have played down the issue of smuggling through the Philadelphi Corridor. .

Most smuggling had instead occurred aboveground at the Rafah crossing, he said, adding that there was “no connection between the weapons in Gaza and the Philadelphi Corridor.”</p><p>Hamas has also heavily relied on other routes, including small fishing boats coming by sea and through the Kerem Shalom crossing between southern Gaza and Israel, three Israeli defense officials said.</p><p>And Hamas has failed to import sophisticated anti-tank missiles, a sign that Egypt’s efforts to stamp out smuggling have had success, two of the three defense officials said. Most of Hamas’s weapons have been locally made, the officials said. In contrast, Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group and a beneficiary of Iranian support, like Hamas, has repeatedly fired advanced anti-tank missiles against Israel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Still Hamas has publicly acknowledged receiving arms from abroad. In May 2021, Yahya Sinwar, then Hamas’s political leader in Gaza, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hL0pusi6Rlw&amp;t=3356s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">singled out Iran</a> for praise, thanking it for not being “stingy” in supplying the group with weapons.</p><p>Eyal Hulata, a former Israeli national security adviser, agreed that much of the smuggling occurred above ground through the Rafah crossing, which before the war served as a conduit for people to move between Egypt and Gaza. Still, in an interview he described underground smuggling in the area as a “serious problem.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The destroyed Rafah crossing in June, photographed while on a tour of the Philadelphi corridor with the Israel Defense Forces.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ronen Bergman/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>A dossier compiled by an Arab intelligence agency in April and obtained by The Times says that some 2,500 tunnels once existed between Gaza and Egypt, but that most were destroyed in an Egyptian government crackdown between 2013 and 2016.</p><p>Around 10 tunnels existed as of early 2024, but increased Egyptian oversight has eroded smuggling in recent years, the document says. Two Israeli defense officials also said Egypt had stepped up anti-smuggling enforcement in recent years, especially regarding the tunnels.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But in their heyday, the tunnels frustrated Israeli officials because they allowed for both weapons and goods like fuel to enter Gaza unchecked.</p><p>Egypt considers Hamas a security threat and is eager to prevent it from arming itself. Yet, the document adds, Egyptian personnel at the border often accept bribes to look the other way.</p><h2 id="link-2ebe8ee9">What does Israel say about smuggling there?</h2><p>In a news conference on Wednesday evening, Mr. Netanyahu insisted that Israel would not agree to a cease-fire unless Israel could secure the corridor.</p><p>“Somebody has to be there,” he said, adding that until “they can actually prevent the recurrence of what happened there before,” Israel should remain.</p><p>Control of the Philadelphi corridor only appeared as a serious stumbling block in the past few weeks. Before that, Mr. Netanyahu barely mentioned it in public, if at all, leading some of his critics to say he was using the matter as a way to sabotage talks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gesturing at a map that shows the Gaza Strip’s border with Egypt.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Ohad Zwigenberg</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Israel, with U.S. backing, has previously pressed Egypt to heighten security along the border by building a high wall extending below ground, with sensor systems that would alert both the Israeli and Egyptian militaries to tunneling and smuggling, according to Egyptian and Israeli security experts.</p><p>Such a system would be similar to the 40-mile underground wall, outfitted with hundreds of cameras, radars and sensors, that Israel built after uncovering tunnels from Gaza into Israel.</p><p>Some have called for advanced screening equipment to be installed at the Rafah crossing to prevent smuggling there.</p><h2 id="link-30db36bc">What does Egypt say?</h2><p>Egypt says it has effectively <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/10/world/middleeast/egypt-gaza-israel-war.html" title="">cut off</a> smuggling routes into Gaza.
