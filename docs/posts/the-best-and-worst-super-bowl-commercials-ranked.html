This is the pregame edition, with all the available national ads that I could track down; the list will be updated after Sunday’s game.</p><p>The trends so far? Nothing controversial, as you would expect, but also — and perhaps for associated reasons — very little creativity. It’s a bad year for ads; the ones at the top of this list aren’t much better than average. More spots than usual depend entirely on the appeal of a relatable celebrity (who is almost certainly male). Concepts beat ideas — there is a lot of fussy, overly complicated silliness and not much in the way of simple, effective storytelling or mood setting.</p><p>(You may not see every commercial listed here during the game, and you may see commercials not listed here. The various broadcast and streaming platforms will carry different selections of ads, and some ads will only be shown in certain regions.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>No. 1</p><h2 id="link-264a0dbc">National Football League</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">N.F.L.</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The N.F.L.’s own feel-good promo, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY9Mlz99z0A" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Somebody,”</a> is affecting in a highly produced, can’t-we-all-just-get-along manner.
