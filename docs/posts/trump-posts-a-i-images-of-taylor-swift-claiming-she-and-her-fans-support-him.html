    <h1>Trump Posts A.I. Images of Taylor Swift Claiming She and Her Fans Support Him</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A representative for Ms. Swift, who has not made an endorsement this election cycle after backing Joseph R. Biden Jr. in 2020, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.</p><p>The mockery from Democrats was swift.</p><p>Representative Eric Swalwell of California, appearing on CNN on Monday, said that the move would backfire on Mr. Trump.</p><p>“This genius, over the weekend, decided to poke the eyes of Swifties and suggest that Taylor Swift is endorsing him,” Mr. Swalwell said. “They are going to have a marvelous time ruining everything for Donald Trump over the next 78 days.”</p><p>A.J. Delgado, a former campaign communications adviser for Mr. Trump in 2016 who sued him for wrongful termination, urged a publicist for Ms. Swift to clear up the misinformation.</p><p>“You’re going to let this go uncorrected?” <a href="https://x.com/AJDelgado13/status/1825506550825316687" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she wrote</a> on X.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s tactics marked another twist in his long-running preoccupation with Ms. Swift, who earlier this year was the focus of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/30/us/politics/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-trump.html" title="">right-wing meltdown</a> over her political preferences. The fixation of the Make America Great Again movement bubbled up around the Super Bowl, when Ms. Swift’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, the Kansas Chiefs’ star tight end, won back-to-back titles.</p></div></div>
