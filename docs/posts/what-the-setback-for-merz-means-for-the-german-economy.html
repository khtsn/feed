In the secret ballot, Mr. Merz was just six votes short of a 316-vote majority, and the identity of the holdouts was unclear. In the vote, 307 lawmakers voted against Mr. Merz and nine abstained. The opposition has 302 votes, suggesting that some in Mr. Merz’s coalition had opposed him.</p><p>Hours later, voting began again. “It is important that Germany gets a stable government, that we can very quickly start working within reliable structures, and that we work to ensure that this country is strong and well governed,” Lars Klingbeil, who is expected to become Germany’s next vice chancellor, told reporters.</p><p>German stocks had slid on the news of the first vote, with economists warning it could be an ominous sign for Mr. Merz’s agenda to revitalize growth in Europe’s biggest economy. Germany’s blue chip index fell, led by drops in defense and energy companies that stood to benefit from the future government’s planned investment programs.</p><p>Mr. Merz’s party, its sister party, the Christian Social Union, and their coalition partner, the center-left Social Democrats, together still have enough votes to elect a chancellor and form a government. </p><p>Here’s what else to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Previous stumbles:</strong> It was not the first time this year that Mr. Merz had lost a high-profile vote in embarrassing fashion. In January, he stirred controversy — and nationwide protests — by forcing a vote on tough new immigration restrictions. He broke a political taboo in the process, by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/world/europe/germany-friedrich-merz-immigration.html" title="">trying to pass the measures</a> with the help of the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD. But the final vote failed, after many lawmakers from Mr. Merz’s own party rebelled.</p></li><li><p><strong>German far right:</strong> The AfD finished second in the February elections, though no other German party will work with it. It has since been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/world/europe/germany-afd-far-right-extremist.html" title="">classified</a> as far-right extremist by Germany’s domestic intelligence agency. After Mr. Merz lost the vote on Tuesday, the AfD’s chancellor candidate, Alice Weidel, called for new elections — a call that will almost certainly be ignored.</p></li><li><p><strong>Relations with Europe:</strong> Mr. Merz had expected to be sworn in on Tuesday. If he isn’t, he will have to redo a carefully orchestrated schedule of foreign visits he was set to undertake. On Wednesday, he planned to visit Paris and Warsaw to meet with President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland, demonstrating a commitment to two key alliances on what was supposed to be his first full day as chancellor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Merz’s party:</strong> A defeat had appeared possible because of Mr. Merz’s thin coalition majority, but not likely. Carsten Linnemann, the secretary general of Mr. Merz’s Christian Democrats, said he was very surprised by the results. “The world and Europe are not waiting for us,” he said. “On the contrary, they would like us to return to stability quickly.”</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="26" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvY2JkMWU3NzktZTRiMy01NjBmLWE5NjYtODQzZTk3ZjFjODc4"><div id="cbd1e779-e4b3-560f-a966-843e97f1c878" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/06/world/merz-germany-chancellor-parliament#cbd1e779-e4b3-560f-a966-843e97f1c878"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jim-tankersley"><img alt="Jim Tankersley" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/19/multimedia/author-jim-tankersley/author-jim-tankersley-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/19/multimedia/author-jim-tankersley/author-jim-tankersley-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/19/multimedia/author-jim-tankersley/author-jim-tankersley-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-06T13:41:56.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 6, 2025, 9:41 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jim-tankersley" itemprop="name">Jim Tankersley</a></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Reporting from Berlin</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>The second round of voting is underway.

Ever since Mr. Merz and his center-right Christian Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/world/europe/takeaways-germany-election.html" title="">won the national election</a> in February, the AfD’s poll numbers have risen as voters take issue with the compromises that the Christian Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats have made to work together as coalition partners. The AfD won 20.8 percent of the vote in February, but the party now polls at around 25 percent, sometimes more than the Christian Democrats.</p><p>This potential boost for the AfD comes days after Germany’s domestic intelligence agency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/world/europe/germany-afd-far-right-extremist.html" title="">labeled</a> the party extremist, which has reinvigorated a debate about whether it should be banned outright.</p><p>All parties, including the AfD, know that if Mr. Merz does not win the required votes to become chancellor in <a href="#merz-germany-chancellor-vote-what-next" title="">subsequent votes</a> (there is no limit on how many can take place), Germany’s President will call new elections.

The other reason was President Trump, whose moves to impose new tariffs and threats to pull back American military support in Europe have given a shared purpose to continental leaders.</p><p>On both fronts, Mr. Merz could be hurt by the vote Tuesday, even if he quickly rebounds to secure the support he needs.</p><p>The result could be a sign that Mr. Merz may struggle to pass legislation to approve the new borrowing and military spending, which was effectively greenlit in March, but not actually appropriated.</p><p>It could also be interpreted as a sign of weakness by Mr. Trump, complicating Mr. Merz’s efforts to simultaneously push back against Washington’s defense and economic policies while cultivating a personal relationship with the president.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="18" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzBhZjViZjIyLTNkMDUtNTRkZi1hMTE5LTQ4Y2RhOTExYjcyOA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/06/world/merz-germany-chancellor-parliament#merz-may-have-set-himself-up-for-failure-in-the-parliamentary-vote" data-source-id="100000010151779"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jim-tankersley"><img alt="Jim Tankersley" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/19/multimedia/author-jim-tankersley/author-jim-tankersley-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/19/multimedia/author-jim-tankersley/author-jim-tankersley-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/19/multimedia/author-jim-tankersley/author-jim-tankersley-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/christopher-f-schuetze"><img alt="Christopher F.

It was the latest in a string of deadly attacks committed by immigrants in Germany over the course of a year, and Mr. Merz decided it needed an immediate response.</p><div><p>He pushed Parliament to vote on a package of measures to toughen immigration policy — and he did so knowing that the only way they could pass would be with votes from the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD. That broke a longstanding taboo in German politics.</p><p>The move may have helped Mr. Merz and his Christian Democrats shore up support among voters upset over immigration. But in several ways, it backfired on Mr. Merz. First, he lost the most important vote on the measures, after members of his own party rebelled.</p><p>He then handed a potent issue to Germany’s far-left party, Die Linke, which rode the backlash to a surprisingly strong finish in the February election. Die Linke’s gains helped to undermine the strength of the center-left parties Mr. Merz needed to form a governing coalition. He entered Tuesday’s vote with a thin majority, and when he lost 18 votes from his own coalition, he failed to become chancellor on the first ballot. The loss left him six votes short of a win.</p><p>Mr. Merz may also have been hindered in the vote by his response to the protests that greeted his immigration vote. Stung by accusations that he was collaborating with the far right, Mr. Merz and allies in Parliament submitted a request for information on the tax-exempt status of progressive organizations that helped organize protests.</p><p>That request angered progressives, including Social Democrats who eventually decided to join Mr. Merz’s governing coalition anyway, seeing the move as a clear attempt to intimidate anyone speaking out against Mr. Merz and his party.</p><p>Tuesday’s vote was anonymous, so it is unclear how many Social Democrats voted against Mr. Merz — or why.</p><p>But the would-be chancellor had recently alienated members of his own party as well, for a different reason.</p><p>After campaigning on promises of fiscal frugality, Mr. Merz reversed course post-election, joining with the Social Democrats and the center-left Green Party to relax government borrowing rules in order to spend freely on the military, infrastructure and other projects.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="17" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad2"><div id="ad-2" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid3">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="16" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvOWE2YzY2MGEtNTYxNy01ZmZmLTljODctNWNhNDEzMWQ4NzY0"><div id="9a6c660a-5617-5fff-9c87-5ca4131d8764" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/06/world/merz-germany-chancellor-parliament#9a6c660a-5617-5fff-9c87-5ca4131d8764"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/christopher-f-schuetze"><img alt="Christopher F.

Prospects for new growth appear dim, particularly with the threats posed to Germany’s export-oriented manufacturing sector by President Trump’s moves to impose high new tariffs.</p><div><p>Mr. Trump is also threatening to rip away America’s European defense umbrella, complicating relations between Germany and the United States, its most important ally of the postwar era. A hostile and aggressive Russia invaded Ukraine to the east and embarked on what appears to be a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/politics/russia-sabotage-attacks-europe-ukraine.html" title="">deliberate sabotage campaign</a> targeting Europe.</p><p>Those developments drove Mr. Merz to push a centrist compromise through a lame-duck session of Parliament in March. That deal relaxes Germany’s hallowed limits on government borrowing to allow significant increases in spending on the military, infrastructure improvements and efforts to combat climate change, in an effort to bolster national security and economic competitiveness. If he makes it into office, Mr. Merz will need to command majorities to spend that newly borrowed money as effectively as possible.</p><p>He will also need to act decisively to address Germans’ concerns about a decade-long flow of immigration to the country from the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere — concerns that have been inflamed by a string of deadly attacks committed by immigrants.</p><p>And he will need to hold off the far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, that has drawn nearly even with Mr. Merz’s Christian Democrats in national polls. The AfD has promised to crack down on migration, and it has gained support from voters disillusioned with Germany’s longtime governing class on the center left and the center right. It has also been classified as a far-right extremist group by German intelligence.</p><p>Mr. Merz is betting that if the government can effectively respond to voter concerns over the economy, migration and security, support for the AfD will fade. But the surprise vote Tuesday, in which he failed to get enough support to become chancellor, shows just how difficult it could be for Mr. Merz to corral an effective response to any one of those problems.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad3"><div id="ad-3" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid4">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNjg3ZDYzOWItMzU1MS01MjE5LWFlY2ItMDgxMzFhZDAwNTlh"><div id="687d639b-3551-5219-aecb-08131ad0059a" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/06/world/merz-germany-chancellor-parliament#687d639b-3551-5219-aecb-08131ad0059a"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nader-ibrahim"><img alt="Nader Ibrahim" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/11/11/reader-center/author-nader-ibrahim/author-nader-ibrahim-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/11/11/reader-center/author-nader-ibrahim/author-nader-ibrahim-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/11/11/reader-center/author-nader-ibrahim/author-nader-ibrahim-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-06T11:28:05.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 6, 2025, 7:28 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nader-ibrahim" itemprop="name">Nader Ibrahim</a></p></div></div></div></div><p>This was the moment Julia Klöckner, the president of the German Parliament, announced the vote count this morning, confirming Merz’s loss in the first round of voting.</p><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/world/europe/merz-first-vote/merz-first-vote--superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Deutscher Bundestag, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="11" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2UzMDhmOWRkLWEwNDMtNTM2Yy04ZTIxLTBkMjk0MzczMjRlZg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/06/world/merz-germany-chancellor-parliament#merz-germany-chancellor-vote-what-next" data-source-id="100000010151721"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/christopher-f-schuetze"><img alt="Christopher F.

Mr. Merz, then a corporate lawyer, had never jumped out of a plane. But a fellow attendee recalled recently that Mr. Merz did not hesitate. He made the jump — successfully, but with a bit of a rough landing.</p><div><p>It is not yet clear if Mr. Merz’s rough landing in his bid for the chancellery is a stumble, or something more dire. He still appears likely to become Germany’s next leader, at a pivotal time for the nation’s economy, security and role in Europe.</p><p>But his inability to secure the votes he needed Tuesday to become chancellor is an ominous sign for Mr. Merz, as he attempts to wrangle lawmakers to confront crises at home and abroad, while holding off a surge from the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD.</p><p>Mr. Merz is a product of the Sauerland in Germany’s wealthy west, a region that defines his politics and persona. During his campaign, he ran on the slogan “More Sauerland for Germany,” evoking the region’s image as a heartland of the country.</p><p>Supporters call him an agile politician with the potential to deliver on the big issues worrying the German public: growth, defense, immigration.</p><p>“I think he’s extremely well prepared and very deep and thoughtful,” said John P. Schmitz, a deputy White House counsel under George H.W. Bush. Mr. Schmitz helped hire Mr. Merz to work in the German offices of the Chicago law firm Mayer Brown and jumped out of the plane in Corsica with Mr. Merz around 2005.</p><p>But others say Mr. Merz struggles to plan more than one step ahead, leading him to break promises — and leaving him vulnerable to surprise setbacks like the vote Tuesday.</p><p>His about-faces on spending and migration have alienated many of his base conservative voters. Mr. Merz and his party have sagged in the polls since the election, and the AfD has drawn even with them in some surveys. Even before the loss Tuesday, he had one of the lowest approval ratings of any German leader in the modern era.</p><p>“There’s this old saying: ‘Whatever you do, act wisely and consider the end,’” said Ruprecht Polenz, a former secretary general of Mr. Merz’s party. “This thinking,” he added, “I feel is not his main strength.”</p><p>Read more about Mr. Merz, his background and his approach to politics in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/world/europe/friedrich-merz-germany.html" title="">our profile of him</a>.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="9" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad4"><div id="ad-4" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid5">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="8" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZjQ5OGYyOWItNDU4NS01OGYwLThlNjQtMmMyYjljZGZiZTc0"><div id="f498f29b-4585-58f0-8e64-2c2b9cdfbe74" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/06/world/merz-germany-chancellor-parliament#f498f29b-4585-58f0-8e64-2c2b9cdfbe74"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/christopher-f-schuetze"><img alt="Christopher F.
