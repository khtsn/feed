In his final week in office, he designated nearly 850,000 acres of federal land in California as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/climate/biden-national-monuments-california.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">two new national monuments</a>.</p><p>Biden, headlines noted, had protected more land than any president in history — some 674 million acres. But amid all the fanfare, another piece of news out of the White House passed with little notice: the signing of legislation allowing a monument dedicated to American women to be built on the National Mall.</p><p>When completed, the Women’s Suffrage National Monument will be the first on the Mall honoring women and their history. But it could also very well be the last, given a 2003 law <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2003/11/20/preservation-law-puts-leash-on-mall-projects/0b4794e8-bd04-439e-bea4-111dc935ac01/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">banning</a> new monuments there.</p><p>The site of the suffrage memorial has yet to be determined.

Success came only in the final hours of the 118th Congress — when failure would have meant having to start all over again.</p><p>It wasn’t quite as dramatic as the photo-finish of the 19th Amendment, which cleared the final hurdle in 1920 after a 24-year-old Tennessee state legislator had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/17/opinion/tennessee-19th-amendment.html" title="">a last-minute change of heart</a> after receiving a letter from his mother urging him to “be a good boy” and support women’s suffrage.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
