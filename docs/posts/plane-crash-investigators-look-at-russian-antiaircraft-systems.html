Russian aviation officials initially blamed birds, but investigators are now focusing on the possibility that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/world/asia/investigators-plane-crash-kazakhstan.html" title="">a Russian air defense system struck the plane</a>.</p><p>The jet was flying from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, to Grozny, in Russia’s Chechnya republic. At the same time, drone strikes were taking place around Grozny and Russian air defense systems were responding. Of the 62 passengers and five crew members aboard, 38 were killed, local authorities said. </p><p>Two Azerbaijanis briefed on the country’s investigation said that its government now believes that a Russian missile had damaged the plane. U.S. officials also said that there are preliminary indications that the plane had been shot down by a Russian antiaircraft system. And aviation experts said that images of the plane showed holes that appeared unlikely to have been caused by birds.</p><p>The Kremlin warned against making any immediate judgments about the cause, but some Russian pro-military bloggers have also pointed the finger at the country’s air defenses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli strikes near the international airport in Sana, Yemen, today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Khaled Abdullah/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-dda2b6a">Israel bombed an airport and ports in Yemen</h2><p>The Israeli military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/world/middleeast/israel-yemen-bombs-houthis.html" title="">unleashed a significant air assault today on parts of Yemen</a> controlled by the Iran-backed Houthi militia, retaliating for the group’s frequent attacks on Israel.
