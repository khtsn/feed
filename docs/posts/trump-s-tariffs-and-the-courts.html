    <h1>Trump’s Tariffs and the Courts</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Just how much power does the president have?</p><p>That was the question in front of the federal courts that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/business/trump-tariffs-blocked-federal-court.html?smid=url-share" title="">ruled against President Trump’s tariffs</a> in the last couple days. The judges weren’t deciding whether the tariffs are good for the country but whether the president has the power to impose them all by himself.</p><p>Maybe that sounds like a technical question. It’s not. It’s not an exaggeration to say that this question defines America. The framers rebelled against Britain because they felt that the king had too much power and that they didn’t have enough say in the politics that shaped their lives. They wrote the Constitution to avoid crowning another monarch.</p><p>Through that lens, a little-known trade court in New York blocked most of Trump’s tariffs, including those that remained from “Liberation Day.” Yesterday, an appeals court agreed to preserve the tariffs while it considers the case. The markets <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/business/stocks-trump-tariffs.html?smid=url-share" title="">rose — cautiously — on the news</a>. America’s trading partners <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/world/europe/us-trade-tariffs-court-decision.html" title="">also reacted skeptically</a> because the rulings could lead to more chaos as legal battles play out.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Today, I want to focus on the question that the courts face.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At a joint session of Congress. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-6f602840">Checks and balances</h2><p>At face value, the Constitution seems clear on this topic. It says Congress, not the president, has the power to “lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises.” And tariffs are taxes.</p><p>But Congress can delegate some powers to the president. It has passed several laws that allow the president to levy tariffs in case of emergency — say, if another country undermines a U.S. industry that’s important to national security. Trump used one of these laws, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, to impose his “reciprocal” tariffs on other countries. (Madeleine Ngo, who covers economic policy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/us/politics/trump-tariffs-ieepa.html" title="">explained the law</a>.)</p><p>The president’s powers, however, are limited. In fact, the law Trump invoked originally <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/are-tariffs-an-emergency-power" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">intended to </a><a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/are-tariffs-an-emergency-power" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>restrict</em></a> the president’s tariff powers.</p><p>The courts ruled that Trump had breached the law’s limits. His allies described the decisions as a “judicial coup.” But in some sense the courts found that Trump was the one who tried to seize power that rightfully belongs to another branch, Congress.</p><h2 id="link-58ed4d79">A solution</h2><p>For Trump, the rulings are frustrating. Tariffs are the centerpiece of his trade strategy, Tony Romm, who covers economic policy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/business/trump-tariffs-trade-strategy.html" title="">wrote</a>. Trump believes that he needs the levies to land trade deals and bring back jobs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The same Constitution that limits Trump also offers a remedy to his problem: Congress could pass a law establishing his tariffs. His party controls the House and the Senate, and it’s even working on a tax bill. If Republican members of Congress believe in Trump’s agenda, they can simply formalize it.</p><p><strong>For more: </strong>As the administration’s court losses pile up, so have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/us/politics/trump-judges-attacks-tariffs.html" title="">its attacks on the judiciary</a>.</p><h3 id="link-4e368a62"><span><strong>CHINESE STUDENTS</strong></span></h3><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agnes Chang</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The administration says <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/politics/china-student-visas-revoke.html" title="">it wants fewer Chinese students in the United States</a>.
