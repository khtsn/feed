Mr. Beshear also said that the water in Elizabethtown, a city of 33,000 residents, was reaching record levels. Some homes in Perry County had been evacuated, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Parts of two dozen state highways were partially or fully flooded, according to the Kentucky State Police.

One to three inches of rain fell over northwest Arkansas to northwest Tennessee on Friday night.</p></li><li><p><strong>Severe storms: </strong>In the Deep South, primarily in northern Louisiana and Mississippi, an outbreak of severe storms that could include tornadoes and damaging winds is possible from Saturday afternoon into the evening.</p></li><li><p><strong>Heavy snow:</strong> Moderate to heavy snow has been hitting the Midwest, which could get up to 13 inches of snow by Sunday. It was expected on Saturday to move toward the Great Lakes through New England. Maine could see up to 19 inches of snow by Monday.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wintry mix: </strong>New York and other cities along the Northeast coast were seeing snow on Saturday afternoon, before warm air moves in, turning the precipitation to a mess of sleet, freezing rain and then rain. Some areas, especially close to the coast, will transition quickly from snow to rain.</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-02-14-winterrisk" data-id="100000009991746" data-source-id="100000009991746"><div slug="2025-02-14-winterrisk" data-sourceid="100000009991746" id="embed-id-100000009991746">
