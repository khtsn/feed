Only the most intrepid travelers followed, as Laos, Southeast Asia’s only landlocked country, operated few — and no long-haul — flights, and potholed and shoddy roads were the norm. Those who made it traded no-frills accommodations and hourslong bumpy drives for adventure, and almost always tacked Laos onto multicountry itineraries that included neighboring Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, all well-oiled tourism machines that each draw at least three times the number of visitors than Laos annually.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/14/multimedia/00Travel-Laos-01-qwct/00Travel-Laos-01-qwct-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/14/multimedia/00Travel-Laos-01-qwct/00Travel-Laos-01-qwct-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/14/multimedia/00Travel-Laos-01-qwct/00Travel-Laos-01-qwct-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A large metal Buddha statue is brightly lit and soars over a temple floor.

In Vientiane, the vending machine was empty and businesses on the second floor had yet to open.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>The train zips through verdant farmland and swampy rice paddies and into the darkness of mountain tunnels. The fare is affordable; a two-hour ride from Luang Prabang to Vientiane cost under $20. But only those with local phone numbers can purchase a ticket on the train’s app; the rest have to use middlemen services, easily available online, or wait in line. (Hotels can generally also help arrange rail travel.)</p></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-18"><div><figcaption><span>Clockwise from upper left: Passengers board the train in Vang Vieng; attendants serve snacks and drinks onboard; the train zips through verdant farmland; and one passenger&#39;s selection of snacks.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Lauren DeCicca for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>At the Vang Vieng station, I met Cheryl Lau, a 68-year-old retiree from Honolulu who was en route to Luang Prabang.

I am by myself and I’m older,” Ms. Lau said, adding that she was encouraged after researching online. “I don’t think I would have done it without the train.

While we had many fantastic and affordable meals throughout the trip, the best was at Doi Kha Noi, a convivial restaurant where the seasonal menu changes weekly; we paid about $30 for lunch for two. Their crispy rice salad featuring sour pork and loaded with fragrant herbs is reason enough to visit to Vientiane.</p><p>Other highlights included a visit to <a href="https://www.ockpoptok.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ock Pop Tok</a>, a textile collective based in Luang Prabang, where we watched artisan weavers hard at their craft.

Its rosewood furnishings (including stately four-poster beds) and marble floors made us feel like we were in a time warp. We took breaks from the city’s swampy humidity in the hotel pool, which was ringed by a lush garden.</p><p>But the center of luxury travel in Laos is undoubtedly Luang Prabang. <a href="https://www.aman.com/resorts/amantaka" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amantaka</a>, an Aman Group resort, opened more than a decade ago, and in 2018, Rosewood Hotel Group <a href="https://www.rosewoodhotels.com/en/luang-prabang/media/press/2018/rosewood-luang-prabang-celebrates-the-rich-history-and-traditions-of-laos-in-its-timeless-design-aesthetic" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opened an opulent 23-room resort</a> on a secluded property.</p><p>Travelers, too, are becoming increasingly aware of Laos and its allure.</p><p>While it remains sought after as an add-on for other Southeast Asia itineraries, interest in Laos is rising, said Heather Heverling, a managing director at <a href="https://www.audleytravel.com/us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Audley Travel</a>, a tour operator based in Britain.

This phenomenon is likely driven in part by the country’s lesser-known reputation and the fact that international travelers from outside the region must first connect at airports in cities like Bangkok and Hanoi. And those flights to Laos are limited. In 2024, there were fewer than 1.8 million airline seats to Laos, most of them offered by Chinese and Thai airlines, according to Cirium, an aviation data company. By comparison, more than 46 million seats were available to Thailand.</p><p>“Laos has always been a ‘plus-one’ country,” said Jason Rolan, a tourism expert who lives in Vientiane. “Its remoteness has kept it sort of preserved as something tourists want to see, but they don’t know about it.”</p><h2 id="link-77be0f7f">Off the train, and on the bus to Nong Khiaw</h2><p>With just two days remaining, Eli and I visited Nong Khiaw, a rural town that was a three-hour drive from Luang Prabang. Enticed by pictures and reviews online, we decided to spend a night there. The journey was deeply uncomfortable. We were crammed in a small van with about a dozen sweaty people sitting thigh to thigh. There was no air conditioning (the temperature was around 90 degrees) and only the suggestion of a breeze. Portions of the roads were unpaved and filled with ditches. I really missed the train.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-38"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A view of Nong Khiaw and the Nam Ou River was worth the sweaty, three-hour drive to the rural town. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christine Chung/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>But it was worth it. Nong Khiaw’s limestone karst landscape loomed over the placid Nam Ou River, where water buffalo rested languidly on the riverbanks. We barely saw anybody else there.</p><p>It was also extremely cheap. Comfortable lodging throughout Laos is generally under $100. In Nong Khiaw, we paid $32 for a night at the <a href="https://www.nongkiau.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nong Kiau River Side</a>, a charming riverside hotel that had an excellent restaurant serving fresh spring rolls and noodle soups.</p><p>The experiences we had there were the best ones of the trip. Eli embarked on a steep hourlong trek up to an overlook called <a href="https://www.tourismlaos.org/luang-prabang-hiking-camping-at-the-best-viewpoint-in-laos-pha-daeng-peak/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pha Daeng Peak</a> and enjoyed sweeping panoramic views of mountains ribboned with mist and the curving Nam Ou River. I crossed a rickety bridge through a rice paddy to visit <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/laos/northern-laos/nong-khiaw/attractions/tham-pha-thok/a/poi-sig/1350416/356929" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tham Pha Thok</a>, a cluster of caves where villagers hid during the Vietnam War. </p><p>One night, we went to <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1520128-d4129600-Reviews-Hive_Bar_and_Restaurant-Nong_Khiaw_Luang_Prabang_Province.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hive Bar</a>, a drinking spot beloved by tourists. I asked Thieng Soudakone, the bar’s owner, how he felt about the tourism changes and burgeoning development. He welcomed the train, he said, but Nong Khiaw was different from other tourism spots, and he hoped it stayed that way.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>“We still have more nature and it’s a peaceful, quiet place. No big hotels and hostels, no traffic here yet,” Mr. Soudakone, 45, said. “The tourists here prefer a bumpy road like this. They don’t need prosperity or civilization in their holiday. They spend their lives closer to locals.”</p><p>It’s this feeling that lured Nabiel Nasran back to Laos after his first visit six years ago. I met Mr. Nasran, a bartender from Singapore, on the van to Nong Khiaw, as he was backpacking through Thailand, Laos and Vietnam with his girlfriend, Celina.</p><p>Mr. Nasran, 27, remarked that the ride to Nong Khiaw was better, because the road’s condition had improved.
