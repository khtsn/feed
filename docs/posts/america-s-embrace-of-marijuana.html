    <h1>America’s Embrace of Marijuana</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><div id="top-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-top">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p><div></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Twelve years ago, mainstream politicians opposed marijuana legalization. Recreational use was forbidden even in the most liberal states.</p><p>Today, even conservative states are considering the policy — including North Dakota, South Dakota and Florida, through ballot initiatives this November. And both presidential contenders now favor legalization. Kamala Harris confirmed her support this month. Donald Trump says he will vote for Florida’s initiative. He also backs easing federal restrictions on weed. This is the first time even one major-party candidate has publicly supported legalizing pot.</p><p>The shift was unusually quick for American politics; it’s very rare for the bipartisan consensus to flip in less than a generation.</p><p>One reason politicians have changed their minds so quickly is that they are following a shift in voters’ views. In today’s newsletter, I’ll look at how public opinion evolved — and why Harris’s and Trump’s positions could matter even in states that have already legalized marijuana.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-6531f2b5">A quick shift</h2><p>Americans’ views on domestic policy are largely stable. Consider guns: Congress passed the last major federal gun measure, the Brady Act, three decades ago. Since then, views on whether firearm laws should be made more or less strict have barely moved, according to Gallup. This is typical for most domestic policy issues, researchers have found.</p><p>Marijuana legalization is an exception. In 2000, 31 percent supported it; <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/514007/grassroots-support-legalizing-marijuana-hits-record.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">now 70 percent do</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The new consensus formed long before politicians caught up. Most Democrats have supported legalization since the late 2000s. Most Republicans have since 2017, according to Gallup.</p><p>Why did public opinion change so quickly? One explanation is exhaustion with the war on drugs. Decades of punitive policy did not get great results. The United States is in the middle of its deadliest drug overdose crisis ever (although overdose deaths <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/21/briefing/has-fentanyl-peaked.html" title="">are now falling</a>). People want reform, and one place to start is a drug that most Americans see as less dangerous than legal substances like alcohol and tobacco.</p><p>The shift has continued even as legalization has produced its own problems. In states where marijuana is legal, people have reported more addiction and other serious medical issues that are linked to daily marijuana use. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/cannabis-marijuana-risks-addiction.html" title="">See some of those harms.</a>) Still, public opinion remains in favor of legal pot — and now Democratic and Republican leaders are catching up.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-b35ebd">Federal impact</h2><p>With many states legalizing marijuana — perhaps a majority, after this year’s election — you may wonder whether it matters that the presidential candidates have come around to legalization. After all, many states addressed the issue before federal officials caught up.</p><p>But federal law still shapes marijuana policy at the state level. For example, many banks, which are regulated at the federal level, remain wary of holding money from marijuana businesses. In many ways, the law treats those transactions the same way it does bank transactions from a drug cartel or another criminal enterprise. This leaves dispensaries open to robbery because many can’t take credit cards and can’t find a secure place to store all their cash.</p><p>Federal regulation can also help address some of the problems that have appeared with legalization.</p><p>Congress will ultimately decide whether federal marijuana laws are loosened or repealed. But the next House and Senate will be able to make such changes with confidence, knowing that they probably won’t face a veto from the White House.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> A jar of legal weed can cost $60 in New York.
