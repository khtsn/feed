    <h1>Trump’s Tax Plans</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><div id="top-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-top">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p><div></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Nothing unifies Republicans like cutting taxes.</p><p>Still, determining which taxes to cut — and how deeply to cut them — can be an ordeal. With Republicans on track for total control of Washington next year, they’ll have to work through several contentious questions before they can pass another tax cut.</p><p>The most important issue will be the cost of the legislation. Some Republicans worry about cutting taxes too much and blowing up the deficit. Others believe tax cuts juice the economy and are worth the consequences. Plenty of Republicans think Americans should keep more of the money they earn.</p><p>In today’s newsletter, I’ll walk through three scenarios for how Republicans could approach cutting taxes next year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p><h2 id="link-210347b8">1. The status quo</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In the Oval Office in 2017. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In 2017, President Donald Trump signed a major tax cut. To contain its cost, Republicans scheduled many of the provisions to expire after 2025, betting that a future Congress would continue them.</p><p>That gamble looks as if it will pay off. Republicans generally agree that the law’s biggest provisions — including lower income-tax rates, a larger standard deduction and lower taxes for many businesses — should not end next year.</p><p>Even doing this much will be expensive. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that extending all of the expiring tax provisions will cost $4.6 trillion over a decade, including additional borrowing costs. The federal government is already expected to borrow roughly $22 trillion over that time frame, bringing the debt to a level many economists find alarming.</p><p>Republicans have floated some spending cuts, like ending subsidies for clean-energy industries, to offset that cost. But savings from the proposed reductions would still fall short of covering the cost of continuing the 2017 tax law. Plus, many of the potential spending cuts are opposed by some Republicans.</p><p>One scenario is that Republicans, struggling to agree to broader changes, simply extend the 2017 law and keep the tax code the way it is now. An extension might even expire in just a few years to hold down the price. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p><h2 id="link-2a2ce5e">2. A few tweaks</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Trump rally in California in October.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jordan Gale for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In his campaign, Trump proposed several new tax cuts. He said that tips and overtime pay shouldn’t be taxed, for instance, and that domestic manufacturers should pay lower taxes. He also proposed reversing one of the few tax increases in the 2017 law, which limited deductions for state and local taxes — a provision that especially affected wealthy people in blue states.</p><p>Congressional Republicans kept their distance from those ideas. If they embraced them now, it would add to the cost of the legislation.</p><p>The exact design of these tax cuts will be important. By one definition of “tip,” many Americans could reclassify their earnings to avoid taxes. Alternately, the provision could apply only to lower-income workers who now make much of their money in tips.</p><p>Trump aides are looking for ways to limit the cost of these moves. One possibility is that Republicans pass limited versions of these ideas — like increasing, but not eliminating, the cap for the state and local deduction. Doing so would still raise the cost of the bill but by a smaller amount than broader interpretations of Trump’s pledges.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-64ce0351">3. An overhaul</h2><p>Then there’s the possibility that Trump persuades Republicans in Congress to carry out the entire fiscal agenda he outlined during the campaign — and potentially take things even further. That could mean deeper tax cuts for corporations, as well as the end of President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which includes funding for both clean energy and the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p>Perhaps the most significant change would be a tariff Trump has proposed for all imported goods. Republicans are discussing whether to pass such a tariff into law, though Trump could also likely enact it with executive authority. That tariff could help pay for the tax cuts, but they probably wouldn’t raise enough to fully offset the cost.</p><p>Passing a tariff into law would make it impossible for a future president to remove them without help from Congress. It would also mark a fundamental change in fiscal policy in the United States. American policymakers have not treated tariffs as a way to generate revenue for the federal government in almost a century.</p><h2 id="link-7a26f15c">The bottom line</h2><p>A new tax cut is almost assured next year. Any additional economic growth created by lower taxes could help many Americans. But the biggest winners will likely be the rich, who pay more tax and therefore reap the biggest benefits from tax cuts. The losers could be the low-income Americans who face higher costs on everyday goods because of tariffs.</p><p>Americans may also suffer in the future. They may have to pay higher taxes or collect smaller benefits from programs like Social Security to help fix the nation’s fiscal problems.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><em>Today’s newsletter is the second installment in a running series on the Trump agenda.
