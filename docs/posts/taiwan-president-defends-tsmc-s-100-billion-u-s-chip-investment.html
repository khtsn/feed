President Trump has pressed Taiwan to loosen its dominance in advanced semiconductors and to move production to the United States, and he has warned of hefty tariffs if his demands are not met.</p><p>But TSMC’s announcement also stirred debate and misgivings in Taiwan, a democratically governed island where many people see the chip sector as a vital economic pillar and a shield against possible aggression by China, which claims it is part of its territory. The commitment from TSMC would lift its planned spending in the United States to $165 billion, more than double its previous commitments there.</p><p>Mr. Lai, in a news conference in Taipei on Thursday with C.C. Wei, the chief executive of TSMC, asserted that the plan was good for TSMC, Taiwan and the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“We have seen every time that with each initiative by TSMC, TSMC has grown even stronger and more competitive, while also providing Taiwan’s businesses with opportunities for international cooperation and contributing to Taiwan’s greater strength,” Mr. Lai told reporters at the presidential office. He said that Taiwan could now “confidently cross the Pacific Ocean and expand eastward to the American continent.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>TSMC is the world’s largest chip manufacturer.

The company has invested billions growing deep roots and a network of highly specialized suppliers in Taiwan. While it has opened <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/09/business/tsmc-kikuyo-japan.html" title="">new factories in Japan</a> and Arizona, its most cutting-edge chips are still made in Taiwan.</p><p>Mr. Lai’s government has been trying to respond to complaints from Mr. Trump that Taiwan spends too little on its own defense, has a disproportionate trade surplus with the United States, and has stolen the semiconductor business from American companies.</p><p>Any rupture with Mr. Trump would be a crisis for Taiwan, which has for decades turned to the United States as its chief political and military supporter against potential threats from China. Beijing claims the island as its territory and says it could use force to take it if its leaders see no hope for peaceful unification.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Wei of TSMC and President Trump announced the chipmaker’s $100 billion investment at the White House on Monday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Last month, <a href="https://english.president.gov.tw/News/6908" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Lai promised to increase</a> Taiwan’s military spending to over 3 percent of its economic output, from about 2.45 percent this year. Mr. Trump and officials around him have said that Taiwan should be devoting 5 percent, or even 10 percent, of its economy to its military.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Trump announced TSMC’s new commitments with Mr. Wei by his side at the White House on Monday. The investment would help TSMC avoid tariffs on chips made in Taiwan, Mr. Trump said.</p><p>The investment will expand TSMC’s footprint in Arizona from three manufacturing plants to six, add 25,000 jobs and create a research and development center to develop production processes. Apple is the facility’s largest customer. TSMC also makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm and Broadcom.</p><p>Despite its global importance, TSMC has shied away from media attention, and its executives rarely take questions from journalists. Mr. Wei, the chief executive, suggested that he did not relish the attention.</p><p>“Life has been a bit stressful lately,” he said, “meeting two presidents in such a short time, and to also have to meet with friends from the media, and then answer questions.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Chris Buckley, the chief China correspondent for The Times, reports on China and Taiwan from Taipei, focused on politics, social change and security and military issues.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/chris-buckley">More about Chris Buckley</a></span></p></div><div><p>Meaghan Tobin covers business and tech stories in Asia with a focus on China and is based in Taipei.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/meaghan-tobin">More about Meaghan Tobin</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>P</strong><strong>anama Canal</strong><strong> Ports</strong><strong>:</strong> An investor group led by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/business/blackrock-panama-canal-ports-hutchison.html">BlackRock will acquire two ports near the Panama Canal</a> that are owned by CK Hutchison, a Hong Kong conglomerate, and that have been the subject of a dispute between President Trump and Panama.</p></li><li><p><strong>Foreign Aid</strong><strong>:</strong> The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/foreign-aid-supreme-court-trump.html">rejected Trump’s emergency request to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid</a> as part of his efforts to slash government spending.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Properties:</strong> The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/trump-federal-property-buildings-sale.html">identified more than 440 federal properties</a> that could be sold off.
