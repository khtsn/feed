    <h1>Interior Department Says Gulf of Mexico Is Now ‘Gulf of America’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The agency on Friday also said the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, a federal body that oversees standardized geographic names, is working “expeditiously” to fulfill Mr. Trump’s order to restore the name of the former president, William McKinley, to the Alaska peak.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/us/mount-mckinley-will-be-renamed-denali.html" title="">Obama administration in 2015 officially named the mountain Denali</a> after decades of advocacy by Alaska Native groups as well as lawmakers from both major parties. On Friday, the Trump administration called that Obama-era decision “an affront” to Mr. McKinley.</p><p>Mr. McKinley, who was from Ohio, had no known connection to Alaska and never visited the mountain. The peak was named for him by a gold prospector and was popularized after he became president and was assassinated.</p><p>Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska, both Republicans, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/climate/denali-mckinley-alaska-trump.html" title="">objected to Mr. Trump’s renaming efforts</a>. They said they felt that Denali was the rightful name of the awe-inspiring white peaks located 20,310 feet above sea level in the home of the Koyukon people and other Alaska Native groups.</p><p>Any proponent of a name change is required by law to make the case before the geographic names board, which is made up of representatives of various government agencies. Under <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/wilderness/upload/Board-of-Geo-Names_508.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the law,</a> if the board does not act in a “reasonable” amount of time, the interior secretary does have the authority to change a name.</p></div></div>
