    <h1>As Cash Fades, Small Retailers Embrace Efforts to Rein In Swipe Fees</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Credit and debit card fees were always a big business expense for Patti Riordan, who owns a hobby shop in Lancaster, Ohio. But, she said, since the coronavirus pandemic, they’ve become a pain point.</p><p>As a pandemic precaution, droves of customers gave up cash in favor of contactless payment methods like tap to pay, and the percentage of Ms. Riordan’s sales processed through a card network rose to 75 percent, up from 65 percent in 2020. Now, so-called swipe fees are her third biggest expense, behind payroll and rent, amounting to roughly $18,000 a year.</p><p>“There is no room to pay more — we’re just operating so thin,” Ms. Riordan said.</p><p>Debit and credit card fees are among the top monthly expenses for many small businesses, which say the costs are becoming more onerous as fewer consumers carry cash. Merchants of all sizes paid a total of $172 billion in processing fees in 2023, up from roughly $116 billion the year before the pandemic, <a href="https://nilsonreport.com/articles/merchant-processing-fees-in-the-united-states-2023/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Nilson Report</a>, which tracks the payments industry. That’s a 48 percent increase.</p><p>When they swipe a credit card, businesses pay fees to the bank that issues the card, to the payment network and, often, to companies like Toast and Square that help process the transaction. The biggest share of those fees — averaging more than 2 percent of a transaction amount — is set by payment networks like Visa and Mastercard and paid to the issuing bank, ultimately benefiting both the banks and the networks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Visa and Mastercard together control more than 80 percent of the market for card purchases. But, the two companies have argued, there is robust competition among payment networks. American Express — which accounts for roughly 11 percent of card purchases, and Discover, roughly 2 percent — are the two other leading payment networks, according to Nilson Report data.</p><p>Merchants can’t negotiate their own fees, and they don’t always understand why the fees change.</p><p>Cheetie Kumar, a two-time James Beard Award Foundation nominee and owner of the Eastern Mediterranean restaurant Ajja in Raleigh, N.C., uses Toast to process card payments. She said she’s not able to see the rates Toast passes on from major networks like Visa and Mastercard. Instead, she sees the total cost of accepting cards, including Toast’s fees, which together amount to about 4 percent of her revenue.</p><p>“There’s just no flexibility in this,” Ms. Kumar said. “It just kind of feels like we’re up against this seemingly permanent expense and we’re not really understanding why.”</p><p>Visa and Mastercard have increased their fees for certain credit card transactions at least once since the pandemic, said Callum Godwin, chief economist at CMSPI, a payments consulting firm. An even bigger factor contributing to the uptick in merchants’ fees, according to Mr. Godwin: The card companies have in the past couple of years shifted toward offering more premium rewards cards that have “substantially higher” fees for retailers. When a customer pays with a premium card, the retailer has to pay more to the bank that issued the card, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/04/multimedia/VISA-MERCHANT-02-zthv/VISA-MERCHANT-02-zthv-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/04/multimedia/VISA-MERCHANT-02-zthv/VISA-MERCHANT-02-zthv-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/04/multimedia/VISA-MERCHANT-02-zthv/VISA-MERCHANT-02-zthv-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Cheetie Kumar sits in a colorful outdoor space with a yellow velvet couch, orange chair and ivy hanging on the wall behind." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/04/multimedia/VISA-MERCHANT-02-zthv/VISA-MERCHANT-02-zthv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/04/multimedia/VISA-MERCHANT-02-zthv/VISA-MERCHANT-02-zthv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/04/multimedia/VISA-MERCHANT-02-zthv/VISA-MERCHANT-02-zthv-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/04/multimedia/VISA-MERCHANT-02-zthv/VISA-MERCHANT-02-zthv-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/b634cd86-7a5a-5ffc-9324-bc4384603d63" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cheetie Kumar, the owner of the restaurant Ajja, said the fees from processing card payments amount to about 4 percent of her revenue.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lissa Gotwals for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Visa and Mastercard say that their fees allow for investments in security like fraud protections and that the speed and efficiency of their network give an incentive to businesses to accept cards. Bill Sheedy, a senior adviser to Visa’s chief executive, also argued that average interchange fees, as a percentage of each transaction, have remained stable over the past decade, even as payment volume has skyrocketed. (Groups representing retailers dispute that assertion.)</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Still, lawmakers and government agencies are taking some steps to rein the fees in.</p><p>The Justice Department in September filed an antitrust lawsuit against Visa, accusing the company of unfairly stifling competition in debit cards and charging unnecessarily high fees. Groups representing small business owners have cheered on that lawsuit. Many merchants, who don’t see the move away from cash reversing anytime soon, are reluctant to pass the costs onto consumers, and are left hoping the government steps in.</p><p>Julie Rottenberg, Visa’s general counsel, said that the government’s allegations are “meritless” and that the lawsuit “ignores the reality that Visa is just one of many competitors in a debit space that is growing, with entrants who are thriving.” On its website, Visa says it uses transaction fees “to balance and grow the payment system for the benefit of all participants.”</p><p>While the Justice Department’s complaint zeros in on debit fees, Doug Kantor, an executive committee member of the Merchants Payments Coalition, said the case also puts a spotlight on credit card transaction fees, which can be even more cumbersome for merchants.</p><p>Legislative efforts to rein in credit card swipe fees include a bipartisan bill introduced last year by Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, called the Credit Card Competition Act. It would require large banks that issue credit cards to enable at least two networks to process payments made with those cards — an effort to increase competition between payment processors beyond Visa and Mastercard, which could lower fees.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Under the proposed law, a merchant would be able to choose to route a card purchase over Visa or Discover, for example, or over a smaller network like Shazam. Some of the biggest retailers, including Walmart and Kroger, have lobbied for the legislation.</p><p>CMSPI estimates that the legislation, if passed, could result in more than $16 billion in savings for merchants and consumers. Mr. Godwin said that while that was a lot of money, it was not nearly enough to “wipe Visa and Mastercard off the map.”</p><p>The largest credit card processing networks and issuers argue that the bill would harm consumers by eroding fraud protections and chipping away at credit card rewards. At a Senate hearing on the legislation earlier this month, Mr. Sheedy of Visa testified that Visa “has no incentive to set interchange fees high or low,” arguing that the act would “remove consumer control over their own payment decisions” and undermine security.</p><p>At the hearing, Linda Kirkpatrick, Mastercard’s president for the Americas, argued that Mastercard, with less than half of Visa’s credit card market share, does not have “the share nor the ability to exert market power.”</p><p>“It’s clear the value derived from electronic payments far outweighs the cost,” Ms. Kirkpatrick testified.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In March, as part of a class-action settlement, Visa and Mastercard <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/26/business/visa-mastercard-swipe-fees.html" title="">agreed to cap the so-called swipe fees</a> they charge to merchants that accept their credit cards, though a judge rejected the settlement in June. Some merchants and trade groups say that the fee caps in the settlement did not go far enough and that Congress needs to pass legislation to promote a more competitive marketplace.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/15/business/15credit.html" title="">amendment to sweeping financial legislation</a> in 2010 imposed price controls on debit transactions, despite objections from the banking industry. It gave the Federal Reserve the authority to regulate and limit the fees businesses pay to card companies.</p><p>That amendment, however, “has not had that great of an effect” on fees, said Keith Barnett, a partner at Troutman Pepper who leads the law firm’s payments practice. The Justice Department, in its antitrust lawsuit, said the amendment initially helped spread debit volume to networks other than Visa, but Visa then used its market dominance to limit competition, undermining the amendment’s intended effects. For example, Visa scaled back JPMorgan Chase’s ability to add Discover’s Pulse network to its Visa-branded debit cards, granting only temporary Pulse access and requiring Chase to enter a routing agreement with Visa, according to the suit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Our margins are very thin,” said Nicole Lintemuth, the owner of the bookstore Bettie’s Pages in Lowell, Mich.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Evan Cobb for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The stance of the incoming Trump administration on regulating payment systems remains unclear. Vice President-elect JD Vance initially cosponsored the Credit Card Competition Act last year but has since distanced himself from the proposal.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“This concern is not going to go away,” said Susan Stephan, a professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Law who specializes in antitrust law. “Consumers are really concerned about rising costs in every arena, and this is one where there’s actually the potential for legislation to make a difference.”</p><p>Many small business are worried that without some relief, their businesses will be crippled.</p><p>Nicole Lintemuth said the roughly $600 she pays in transaction fees each month translates to less inventory on the shelves of her bookstore in Lowell, Mich., called Bettie’s Pages. She said she has also had to cut back on staffing to ensure she has a cushion to make payroll.</p><p>Late July through August is typically a slow period for her business. This year, she said, she wasn’t sure she’d be able to pay rent for September. Loyal customers shopped to boost sales and ultimately helped her stay afloat. But seeing a “huge portion” of the money she earned go to transaction fees was frustrating, she said, forcing her to consider raising prices.</p><p>In 2023, just over 3 percent of her total sales went to fees.</p><p>“Our margins are very thin,” Ms. Lintemuth said. “That’s the difference between a successful month and a not successful month.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
