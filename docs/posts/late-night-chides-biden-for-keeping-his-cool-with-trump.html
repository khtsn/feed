Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/trump-biden-white-house.html" title="">at the White House</a>, where they exchanged pleasantries and promised a “smooth transition.”</p><p>Seth Meyers called Biden’s accommodation “just a little confusing.”</p><blockquote><p>“You correctly called him a criminal fascist and threat to democracy. I’m not saying booby-trap the place, but you don’t have to be overly helpful. I mean, how are you going to accommodate him anyway — upgrade all the toilets so they can handle more classified documents?” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-1"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3Fu6YFJu5k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><blockquote><p>“Trump said they had a ‘really good’ meeting. He said that Biden was ‘gracious’ and that they ‘really enjoyed seeing each other.’ Last week, Joe Biden was an evil force who weaponized the justice system to put Trump in prison for the rest of his life; today, they had fun.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Joe complimented Trump on overcoming many obstacles that he has also faced, like stairs.” <em>— GREG GUTFELD</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“Now that’s a man who appreciates a smooth transition of power, as long as it’s transitioning toward him. If it’s transitioning away from him, there’s going to be some Jan. 6-ing, but if it’s toward him, smooth.” <em>— JORDAN KLEPPER</em></p><p>“I mean, they did both try to hang Mike Pence, just out of tradition, but other than that, it was very cordial.” <em>— JORDAN KLEPPER</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-36270f75">The Punchiest Punchlines (New Low Edition)</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“During the campaign, I thought if Trump won, he would do the worst things I could imagine. Turns out, I don’t have much of an imagination.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“Matt Gaetz as attorney general — this is a new low. I mean, not as low as our age-of-consent laws are about to be, but pretty low.” <em>— JORDAN KLEPPER</em></p><p>“Quick question: the Department of Justice isn’t within 100 feet of a school, is it?” <em>— JORDAN KLEPPER</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><blockquote><p>“You know, in a lot of jobs being investigated for sex trafficking in underage girls would hurt your chance for advancement, but in the Trump administration, you can list it on your résumé under ‘special skills.’” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Now, if you’re fortunate enough not to spend your life watching Fox News, and you’re wondering if Pete Hegseth is one of the few responsible journalists on there, he’s not.” <em>— JORDAN KLEPPER</em></p><p>“First Lee Zeldin and now Pete — it feels like they are stealing my guests.

There’s nothing more intimidating than a morning talk show host. It’s why Regis was so valuable to J.F.K. during the Cuban missile crisis.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“This guy is a weekend host on ‘Fox &amp; Friends’ — he didn’t even make it to the Monday show.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“If we have a war on a weekday, he won’t know what to do.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>Jimmy Kimmel pranked his Aunt Chippy by sending her a driverless car.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-1a7073d0">What We’re Excited About on Thursday Night</h2><p>Francis Ford Coppola will discuss his film “Megalopolis” on Thursday’s “Daily Show.”</p><h2 id="link-12f48db0">Also, Check This Out</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Michael Zegen and Heléne Yorke in “Strategic Love Play” at the Minetta Lane Theater in New York.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sara Krulwich/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
