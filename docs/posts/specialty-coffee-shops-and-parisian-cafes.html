    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>It’s a Parisian scene as iconic as the Eiffel Tower: the sidewalk cafe, where outside, rattan bistro chairs and tables invite passers-by to linger and engage in people-watching, and inside, strangers mill about the bar and exchange small talk over astringent espressos and glasses of wine.</p><p>But over the last 15 years, a distinctly Anglophone, caffeinated import has been putting the squeeze on Paris’s cafes and bistros: the specialty coffee shop. With their carefully curated aesthetic, artisanal fare and rapid growth, coffee shops, some say, have increasingly poached the attention, time and euros of Parisians as well as the millions of international travelers who visit the French capital every year.</p><p>Since the early 2010s, when the first wave of niche coffee shops opened in France, their number has risen 74 percent across the country to 3,500, with a new coffeehouse now opening every week, according to <a href="https://collectifcafe.fr/app/uploads/2024/12/Dossier-de-Presse-Collectif-Cafe-2024-1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Collectif Café</a>, a trade association.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/20/multimedia/20paris-coffee-shops-jfbw/20paris-coffee-shops-jfbw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/20/multimedia/20paris-coffee-shops-jfbw/20paris-coffee-shops-jfbw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/20/multimedia/20paris-coffee-shops-jfbw/20paris-coffee-shops-jfbw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="The exterior of a Paris corner cafe, with rattan bistro chairs and tables on the sidewalk." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/20/multimedia/20paris-coffee-shops-jfbw/20paris-coffee-shops-jfbw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/20/multimedia/20paris-coffee-shops-jfbw/20paris-coffee-shops-jfbw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/20/multimedia/20paris-coffee-shops-jfbw/20paris-coffee-shops-jfbw-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/20/multimedia/20paris-coffee-shops-jfbw/20paris-coffee-shops-jfbw-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/dccd719b-ce71-5479-b0de-0e7adda40ee3" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Café Ventura, in Paris’s Pigalle neighborhood. It’s hard to overstate the importance of cafes in French culture, though their numbers are declining. According to one estimate, France in the 1960s had about 200,000 bistros and cafes. They now number around 40,000. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Do coffee shops pose a danger to us? The answer is yes,” said Alain Fontaine, the owner of <a href="https://www.lemesturet.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Le Mesturet</a> bistro in the Second Arrondissement who petitioned the French government for six years to protect cafes and bistros with a special cultural-heritage status. They received it in September. “In the long run, it could shut down businesses like ours,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Parisian cafes and bistros have faced competition before, in the form of fast-food and coffee chains (notably Starbucks), at-home coffee machines (notably Nespresso), food delivery services, declining alcohol consumption, remote work and changing consumer habits.</p><p>In the 1960s, France counted about 200,000 bistros and cafes across the country. (The distinction between cafes and bistros has blurred over time; both serve food and drink.) Today, that number has fallen to about 40,000, Mr. Fontaine said.</p><p>The post-pandemic years witnessed much of the growth of the specialty coffee shop, with some new establishments offering takeout only, while others are laptop-friendly. Many are similar in design — small and minimalist, often with a Scandinavian aesthetic. Some also sell flowers or vintage goods, or draw inspiration from Asian ingredients.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Recto Verso opened in February 2023.

Ms. Bantman cherishes the sense of community there. But while her friends knock back their 1.40 euro (about $1.45) espressos, Ms. Bantman nurses a Perrier.</p><p>“There are about 15 of us every morning, and it’s packed,” she said. “And the coffee is an undrinkable disaster.”</p><p>This morning stop is for good company, but for good caffeine, Ms. Bantman then picks up a €3 cortado or piccolo, to go, from her regular coffee shop before heading to the office.</p><h2 id="link-3e7484f7">The coffee</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The first Coutume Café opened on the Left Bank in 2011.

cozier and, of course, the coffee is better.</p><p>“Our generation needs to go to a place where they can take a photo with their coffee and share it on social networks,” she said. “People in their 40s and upward aren’t necessarily looking for that at all.”</p><p>Mr. Clark, of Coutume, calls this younger generation the “coffee natives.”</p><p>“We’ve been around for 13 years, and I remember giving out free babyccinos to customers when they were five years old,” he said, referring to an order of warmed milk topped with foam and cocoa powder. “Now they’re 18.”</p><p>They grew up going to coffee shops with their parents, he said, and never knew life without latte art.</p><h2 id="link-7a7c2211">The culture</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div

Last September, the French minister of culture, Rachida Dati, recognized this too, and <a href="https://www.culture.gouv.fr/presse/communiques-de-presse/ceremonie-nationale-d-inclusion-a-l-inventaire-national-du-patrimoine-culturel-immateriel-pci" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inscribed bistros and cafes</a> into the country’s National Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage, which works to protect and promote French social practices and artisanal know-how.</p><p>The petition submitted by Mr. Fontaine, the owner of Le Mesturet bistro, emphasized that “bistros and cafes are distinguished by a personalized quality of service by creating a unique atmosphere. They are characterized by the rich interaction between bistro owners, waiters and customers within this cultural space.”</p><p>In modern sociological parlance, cafes and bistros are Paris’s “third place” — a location of social interaction outside work and home, where lonely seniors go to chat with the bartender, or where students and others can escape from small apartments.</p><p>Over time, the concern is that the cafe’s role as the heart of Parisian society will become obsolete, Mr. Fontaine said, as the younger generation turns to the coffee shop.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“There’s no depth to the coffee shop, there’s no history, there’s no patina,” he said.</p><h2 id="link-708e3af1">The contrarians</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Patrons at Café Jirisan snap photos of matcha lattes and other treats.

Inside, the space evokes a rustic cottage, where Korean and French titles line bookshelves and an artificial fireplace flickers in the corner.</p><p>“When I go into a cafe, I imagine a warm atmosphere, but I want to feel at ease,” said the owner Hera Hong, a South Korean expat. “What I like to see is people who stay and knit, read their books, a bit like a grandmother’s home.”</p><p>Not all cafe managers share Mr. Fontaine’s concerns. Jérôme Martinho, the manager of Café Ventura, said these worries were unfounded.</p><p>“I don’t think we have the same clientele,” he said, adding that he believes coffee shops cater to a niche market, while cafes offer more — a greater selection of food and coffee, as well as alcohol — in one space.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Many customers who head straight to the bar at cafes, where espressos are cheaper than table service, are blue-collar workers, he said, in search of a quick, inexpensive caffeine hit.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The interior of Café Jirisan, in the Second Arrondissement, evokes a rustic cottage. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>In 2020, Ms. Bantman, the researcher, wrote a <a href="https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/as/2020-v44-n2-as05874/1075682ar/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paper</a> published in the journal Anthropologie et Sociétés that argued the meteoric growth of coffeehouses has led to a reinvention of French elitism.</p><p>In a recent interview, she elaborated on its supporting themes, which included coffee prices — between €1 and €1.50 for an espresso at the cafe bar, compared with the €5 or more for a specialty coffee — as well as class and the educational levels of patrons and owners of these establishments. Those at coffee shops tend to be college educated, she said, while cafe counter drinkers might have less schooling.</p><p>Age too is a critical difference.
