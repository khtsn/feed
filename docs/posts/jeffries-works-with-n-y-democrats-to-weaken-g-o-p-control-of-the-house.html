Kathy Hochul, he aggressively pushed for legislation that would give the governor far more time to call special elections for unoccupied legislative seats, according to several people familiar with the discussions.</p><p>Mr. Jeffries had one looming vacancy in particular in mind: the House seat that Representative Elise Stefanik would step down from if she is confirmed as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/nyregion/elise-stefanik-trump-un.html" title="">President Trump’s U.N. ambassador</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Current law would require Ms. Hochul, a Democrat, to schedule a special election to fill the Republican-leaning seat within about three months of Ms. Stefanik’s resignation. But Democratic majorities in the State Legislature could soon grant the governor the ability to wait far longer to schedule the contest — potentially lining it up with the state’s regular June 26 primary date, or even the general election in November.</p><p>By doing so, they would deprive the Republicans’ already bare-bones House majority of a crucial vote for months as they try to fund the government and pass major tax and immigration legislation.</p><p>Republicans currently control 218 seats, including Ms. Stefanik’s in New York’s North Country, to the Democrats’ 215. (Republicans are expected to pick up two more seats in Florida in special elections in April.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, would vacate her House seat if she is confirmed as President Trump’s U.N. ambassador.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tom Brenner for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Republicans are furious, and they have set out to kill the proposal before it becomes law. In a statement, Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, called the maneuver “an open display of political corruption.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Instead of working to address high costs, taxes or fees, the illegal immigration crisis, crime, antisemitism on college campuses or other priorities, New York Democrats are instead working feverishly to silence the voices and needs of more than 750,000 citizens in New York’s 21st Congressional District,” he said.</p><p>The discussion by state lawmakers of pushing back scheduling of special elections <a href="https://capitolpressroom.org/2025/01/31/legislature-considers-tweaks-to-special-election-calendar/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was disclosed</a> by Capital Pressroom on Friday. But the involvement of Mr. Jeffries, one of the most powerful Democrats in the state, has not been previously reported.</p><p>Christie Stephenson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Jeffries, did not address the leader’s involvement or political motivation when asked for comment.</p><p>She wrote in a statement that Mr. Jeffries “supports any good government initiative and legislative effort designed to expand the number of people who participate in a congressional special election.” She also pointed out that other states, like Texas and Florida, already allow their governors far more discretion when scheduling special elections.</p><p>Albany Democrats had been coalescing late last week around the idea of extending the timeline so that a special election for Ms. Stefanik’s seat would coincide with New York’s June primary. But Mr. Jeffries is still pushing for a longer timeline to keep the seat vacant as long as possible, two of the people said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Privately, Democrats like Mr. Jeffries argue that if Republicans do not hesitate to wield their own power in the states to advance their cause, neither should Democrats. If they can hold up Republican policies they abhor in Congress, it is worth the cost.</p><p>They point to Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a Republican, who has been sued repeatedly in recent years for holding open Democratic-leaning congressional and state legislative seats for months without calling a special election. He has moved comparatively quickly to fill Republican-held seats.</p><p>Democrats in New York used a similar rationale in 2021 when they tried to adopt gerrymandered congressional districts. They were slapped down by the courts. Any attempt to change the special election law could attract a similar lawsuit.</p><p>Democratic legislative leaders in Albany have yet to agree to Mr. Jeffries’s request. And as of Monday afternoon, no bill text had been introduced.</p><p>Ms. Hochul has indicated to colleagues that she wants to help Mr. Jeffries and their party in Washington, according to the people familiar with the talks, who were not authorized to discuss them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The two met to discuss the matter on Friday over lunch near South Street Seaport with at least two other New York Democrats close to the leader, Representatives Gregory W. Meeks of Queens and Joseph Morelle of Rochester.</p><p>Mr. Morelle, who has also joined Mr. Jeffries in calls to top legislative leaders in Albany in recent days, did not respond to messages seeking comment.</p><p>Mr. Meeks declined to expand on their discussions. “I’m not going to talk about it,” he told a reporter on Monday.</p><p>Ms. Hochul could indirectly benefit from the change herself. A narrower majority would theoretically force individual Republicans in Congress to take more politically painful votes to advance Mr. Trump’s agenda. Among them is Representative Mike Lawler, a Hudson Valley Republican who might run against Ms. Hochul next year.</p><p>“These are the same people that lecture everybody about protecting democracy but have no problem subverting democracy when it suits their needs,” Mr. Lawler said on Monday while in Albany, where he previously served in the State Assembly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Speaking to reporters in the State Capitol on Monday, Ms. Hochul did not mention the outreach or its potential political impact. But she did indicate she was considering changing the law and cited other potential justifications.</p><p>Special elections that coincide with regularly scheduled elections could save counties money and boost turnout, the governor said.</p><p>Ms. Stefanik, for her part, is expected to easily win Senate approval for the U.N. post. She spent the weekend on a farewell tour of her district. But some Republicans said that the maneuvering by New York Democrats could force their party to delay her confirmation vote until other House vacancies are filled with new Republican members.</p><p>A spokesman for Ms. Stefanik did not return requests for comment.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Tariffs:</strong> President Trump’s move to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/us/politics/trump-tariffs-global-economic-order.html">threatening to fracture a world economic order</a> that once revolved around a U.S. economy that prized open investment and free markets.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.A.I.D.:</strong> Elon Musk said that Trump believes the U.S. Agency for International Development <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-usaid-agency.html">should be shut down</a>, adding to the questions over the administration’s plans for the agency.</p></li><li><p><strong>DOGE:</strong> Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent gave Musk’s representatives at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-federal-payments-system.html">access to the federal payment system</a>, a powerful tool to monitor and potentially limit government spending.</p></li><li><p><strong>Immigration:</strong> The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/us/politics/trump-venezuela-temporary-protected-status.html">ended Temporary Protected Status for more than 300,000 Venezuelans</a> in the United States, leaving the population vulnerable to potential deportation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Government Web Pages:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/upshot/trump-government-websites-missing-pages.html">More than 8,000 web pages</a> across more than a dozen U.S. government websites have been taken down, as federal agencies rush to heed Trump’s orders targeting diversity initiatives and “gender ideology.”</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
