Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said late Friday that Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III had ordered the deployment of fighter aircraft, ballistic missile defense destroyers and B-52 long-range bombers to assist in the defense of Israel and other U.S. interests in the region.</p><p>“Secretary Austin continues to make clear that should Iran, its partners, or its proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the United States will take every measure necessary to defend our people,” General Ryder <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3954442/statement-from-pentagon-press-secretary-maj-gen-pat-ryder-on-middle-east-force/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>.</p><p>The United States has already bolstered its military presence in the region as tensions rise.
