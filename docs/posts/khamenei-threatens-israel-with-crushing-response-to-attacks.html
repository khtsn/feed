But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/world/middleeast/iran-threatens-retaliation-israel-strikes.html" title="">in recent days</a>, Iranian officials have changed their tone.</p><p>Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has the authority as commander in chief to order strikes on Israel. In <a href="https://x.com/khamenei_ir/status/1852657586505384183" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> posted online, he said on Saturday that Israel and the United States would “definitely receive a crushing response” for actions against Iran.</p><p>His remarks echoed two Iranian officials who this past week said that Iran would retaliate, with one telling state news media that a response would be “definite” and a second saying Iran would launch “a fierce, tooth-breaking” response.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>After years of avoiding direct military clashes, Iran and Israel have been locked in an escalating monthslong <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-iran-conflict-history.html" title="">cycle of retaliation</a> that has drawn in their allies and proxies, bringing the region to the brink of an all-out war.</p><p>The Pentagon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/troops-mideast-israel-war.html" title="">in late September extended the deployment</a> of an aircraft carrier strike group in the Gulf of Oman to deter Iranian attacks and shoot down any ballistic missiles fired into Israel.</p><p>To maintain those kinds of capabilities in the region when that carrier, the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln, returns to its home port, the Pentagon announced late Friday that a new deployment of ships and land-based warplanes would head to the region.</p><p>Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said that Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III had ordered the deployment of fighter aircraft, ballistic missile defense destroyers and B-52 long-range bombers to assist in the defense of Israel and other U.S. interests in the region.</p><p>“Secretary Austin continues to make clear that should Iran, its partners, or its proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the United States will take every measure necessary to defend our people,” General Ryder <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3954442/statement-from-pentagon-press-secretary-maj-gen-pat-ryder-on-middle-east-force/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The United States has already bolstered its military presence in the region as tensions rise.

Both groups are Iranian proxies. But those efforts have floundered, and the fighting has continued unabated.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Damage from an Israeli airstrike on Friday in Bekaa Valley, in eastern Lebanon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>On Friday, heavy Israeli strikes killed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/world/middleeast/israel-beirut-strikes-hezbollah.html" title="">at least 52 people in central Lebanon</a>, according to the Lebanese authorities, and seven people in Israel were killed by Hezbollah rocket attacks in the country’s north.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Israeli military said on Saturday that its forces had struck more than 120 sites in both Lebanon and Gaza since the day before, including an airstrike in the Lebanese city of Tyre that it claimed killed two Hezbollah commanders.

The Israeli military said that three rocket launches had been detected from Lebanon, including at the region that includes Tira.</p><p>Magen David Adom, Israel’s emergency medical service, said 11 people were wounded in Tira, with most of the injuries minor to moderate.
