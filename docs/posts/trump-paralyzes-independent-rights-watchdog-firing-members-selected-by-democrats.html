Felten and Travis LeBlanc — to submit their resignations by that deadline, saying Mr. Trump would terminate them if they did not. </p><p>But the deadline came and went. Having received no further word, the three remained in their positions on Friday, when the board released a long-in-the-works study of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/us/politics/terrorism-watch-list-trump.html" title="">terrorism watchlists, which keep people off planes or subject them to extra screening at airports</a>.</p><p>On Monday afternoon, however, a White House official, Trent Morse, sent emails to the three members of the board, informing them of their dismissals. The New York Times reviewed one of the emails, and Mr. LeBlanc confirmed that all three had been fired. Others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump did not remove the sole Republican-selected member, Beth Williams, and a fifth seat was already vacant. </p><p>But the agency needs at least three members to take official actions like starting a new investigative project or issuing a board report with a policy recommendation, so the move has crippled its ability to function.</p><p>Congress established the agency as an independent unit in the executive branch after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, to investigate national security activities that can intrude upon individual rights, like the government’s use of surveillance affecting Americans.</p><p>It has security clearances and subpoena power, and is set up to have five members, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, who serve six-year terms and can stay on for another after that if no successor has been confirmed. Some members are picked by the president, and some are selected by congressional leaders of the other party.</p><p>In a statement, Mr. LeBlanc thanked Mr. Trump for having appointed him in his first term, after Democrats selected him, but said that cutting short the terms Congress had intended the Democratic members to serve would undermine the board’s independence in performing oversight work that is “absolutely essential to accountability in a democracy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I regret that the board’s partisan shift will ultimately undermine not only the mission of the agency, but public trust and confidence in the ability of the government to honor privacy rights, respect civil liberties, honestly inform the public, and follow the law,” Mr. LeBlanc said.</p><p>Of the three Democratic-selected members, the board’s chairwoman, Ms. Franklin, was set to depart later this week regardless. But Mr. Felten had been set to stay on until as late as January 2026, and Mr. LeBlanc till January 2029.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
