Emergency medical workers took the man to Bellevue Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.</p><p>The dead man’s name was not released pending notification of his family. The assailant, believed to be in his 30s, fled from the station, the police said. The investigation was continuing, and no arrests had been made as of Friday afternoon, the police said.</p><p>It was unclear what prompted the fight that preceded the stabbing. The police said they did not believe the men knew each other.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At 10:15 a.m., a splatter of what appeared to be blood was visible inches from the edge of the station’s downtown platform. Officers milled about the blocked-off platform, as downtown trains, diverted from the station amid the investigation, rumbled past. Riders on the uptown side looked on, stunned and confused.</p><p>The killing came at a fraught time for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that operates the subway and is in a standoff with the Trump administration over funding for the transit system.</p><p>Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, has waged a public campaign since February <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/nyregion/trump-nyc-mta-crime-stats.html" title="">deriding</a> the subway system as lawless and dangerous, and threatening to <a href="https://x.com/SecDuffy/status/1904601751073742936" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">withhold federal money</a> unless the M.T.A. addressed crime in the system.</p><p>But crime on the subway has declined, a trend that Jessica Tisch, the city’s police commissioner, has attributed to the deployment of additional officers on platforms and trains.</p><p>Major crime on the subway fell 18 percent in the first three months of the year, according to Police Department data. For the first time in seven years, there were no murders in the transit system in the year’s first quarter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As of last Sunday, overall crime in the system had risen slightly since the start of the year, but was almost 11 percent lower compared with last year’s first quarter.</p><p>Still, after a series of random and jarring attacks in the system over the past two years, transit officials have struggled to dispel a persistent belief among some riders that the subway is unsafe. The killing on Friday was likely to add to that perception.</p><p>Some people have criticized the number of officers now patrolling the system, but Elizabeth Daley, who was waiting for a train on the uptown platform Friday morning, said she would like to see more.</p><p>“A lot of the time I would rather take a 30- or 40-minute walk just because once you’re in there and it’s moving, you can’t really get out,” Ms. Daley, 20, said.</p><p>Others shrugged off the episode, describing it as unsettling but not unusual.</p><p>“Obviously it freaks me out, but it’s New York. It’s a normal thing,” said Jonathan Ricket, a 19-year-old Pace University student who lives in Newburgh, N.Y., and commutes into the city daily for classes.</p><p>He paused for a moment.</p><p>“I’m just glad I didn’t see it,” he added.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maia Coleman is a reporter for The Times covering the New York Police Department and criminal justice in the New York area.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
