over Gaza</a> would have to overcome or ignore many serious obstacles, including that forcibly removing its entire population would be a violation of international law.</p><p>But aside from legal challenges, there is the hard fact that unexploded munitions litter the territory after months of Israeli bombardment, posing a lethal danger to anyone in Gaza for the foreseeable future.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/trump-gaza-strip-netanyahu.html" title="">his remarks unveiling the idea last week</a>, Mr. Trump suggested that he had thought about it. “We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site,” he said.</p><p>The president has said he might send the military to Gaza as an occupation force, but federal law <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:10%20section:407%20edition:prelim)" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prohibits U.S. troops from doing demining missions</a>. Instead, that work falls to the State Department, which <a href="https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-political-military-affairs/key-topics-office-of-weapons-removal-and-abatement#grants" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">provides funding to nongovernmental organizations</a> to do the job.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>And that is where the White House has created an unforced problem for itself.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The number of weapons Israel has used in Gaza is not publicly known, but a New York Times investigation found that Israel had used nearly 30,000 munitions in the first seven weeks of the war.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haitham Imad/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Jan. 25, the State Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/us/politics/mine-clearing-programs-state-dept.html" title="">issued a stop-work order</a> to all of the nonprofit organizations it funds to find, remove and destroy unexploded munitions around the world. Many of those charities would almost certainly be called on to clear Gaza once the fighting stops.</p><p>The U.N. agency responsible for monitoring global explosive contamination and funding many of those groups has asked the State Department for an exception to its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/world/asia/trump-usaid-freeze.html" title="">90-day hold on foreign aid</a> so its lifesaving work could continue. But Secretary of State Marco Rubio rejected that request, according to a U.N. spokesman.</p><p>The State Department provided no additional information on its decision.</p><p>The issue came up again on Sunday, when Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/world/middleeast/trump-gaza-us-takeover.html" title="">mentioned Gaza</a> on his way to the Super Bowl. “Think of it as a big real estate site, and the United States is going to own it,” he said on Air Force One.</p><p>The Israeli military has used a wide array of explosive munitions in Gaza since the Hamas-led attacks in Israel on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/world/middleeast/timeline-gaza-israel-attacks-hamas.html" title="">Oct. 7, 2023</a>, which killed about 1,200 people. Israel’s bombardment of the territory, mostly with U.S.-made weapons, has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians since the start of the war, according to Gaza’s health ministry.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The number of weapons Israel has used against Gaza is not publicly known. But a New York Times investigation in December found that Israel had launched, fired or dropped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-bombing.html" title="">nearly 30,000 munitions into the territory in the first seven weeks</a> of the war, more than in the next eight months combined.</p><p>“Munitions like bombs, rockets or mortars have an inherent failure rate, but when used in an urban environment like Gaza, there is also potential for them to graze their targets instead of striking them squarely,” the bomb-disposal expert <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-king-053a4b48/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Colin King</a> said in an interview. “That can damage, deflect or slow them down enough that their fuzes won’t work properly upon impact, causing them to not detonate and instead become unexploded hazards in an armed and highly unpredictable condition.”</p><p>Some bomb-disposal experts have said that as much as 10 percent of the weapons Israel has used in Gaza may have failed to explode and can remain as hazardous duds for decades or even centuries until they are found and cleared.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Removing an unexploded munition from a home in Khan Younis in Gaza in 2021.

Since the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/17/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire" title="">went into effect on Jan. 19</a>, they have begun surveying the destroyed landscape for unexploded munitions as a crucial first step in their work.</p><p>The United States has spent about $5 billion on demining efforts in 125 countries since those efforts began in 1993, according to <a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/to-walk-the-earth-in-safety-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent State Department report</a>.</p><p>That was two years before the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/12/world/opening-vietnam-overview-us-grants-vietnam-full-ties-time-for-healing-clinton.html" title="">normalized diplomatic relations with Vietnam</a>.</p><p>Providing that funding was a sign of good will.

About 20 percent or more failed to detonate on impact for a variety of reasons, including poor quality control during production. In some cases, pilots under fire dropped them at such a high speed and low altitude that the bomblets did not arm properly before hitting the ground.</p><p>In 2017, President Trump <a href="https://dod.defense.gov/portals/1/documents/pubs/dod-policy-on-cluster-munitions-osd071415-17.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reversed a 2008 policy</a> that would have eliminated cluster munitions from the Pentagon’s arsenal.
