Gavin Newsom announced that the state would instead first open a kind of starter segment of the train connecting two smaller cities in California’s agricultural Central Valley.</p><p>A spokesman for the state rail authority said the state intended to keep the project moving forward.</p><p>“We remain firmly committed to completing the nation’s first true high-speed rail system connecting the major population centers in the state,” the spokesman, Micah Flores, said in a statement. “While continued federal partnership is important to the project, the majority of our funding has been provided by the state.”</p><p>The agency, the statement added, will “fully address and correct the record in our formal response.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Wednesday, Daniel Villaseñor, a spokesman for the governor, referred questions about the report to the high-speed rail authority, and to the governor’s recent budget presentation, in which he proposed at least $1 billion per year in state spending over the next 20 years.</p><p>“Real tracks are being laid,” he said. “Our commitment is firm.”</p><p>The move was not unexpected; since his first administration, California’s high-speed rail plan has been a favorite target for President Trump, who has scarcely missed an opportunity to spar with leaders of the nation’s biggest, bluest state, and in particular, Mr. Newsom.</p><p>“That train is the worst cost overrun I’ve ever seen,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office this month, during a joint appearance with Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada.</p><p>Supporters, who blame factors like inflation and rising land values for making the project more expensive over time, say a major investment in high-speed rail is the only way to get Californians out of their gas-guzzling cars and off emissions-spewing planes. But critics say that the project has suffered from catastrophic mismanagement.</p><p>In February, federal transportation officials opened a compliance review of how the state is spending a $3.1 billion federal grant issued under the Biden administration. Federal authorities are also proposing to pull back about $929 million awarded during the 2010 fiscal year.</p><p>Wednesday’s report said that, based on the findings of that review, the federal government will end two funding agreements unless the California High-Speed Rail Authority can demonstrate that the report is wrong within the 30-day period.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jill Cowan is a Times reporter based in Los Angeles, covering the forces shaping life in Southern California and throughout the state.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">U.S. Politics: News and Analysis</h2><h3>Here’s a look at the political landscape across America.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Senator Joni Ernst: </strong>The Republican from Iowa has drawn <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/us/politics/jd-scholten-joni-ernst-iowa-senate-race.html">a new Democratic challenger</a> after she dismissed a suggestion that her party’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/politics/medicaid-cuts-joni-ernst-iowa-town-hall.html">proposed cuts to Medicaid would lead to constituents dying.</a></p></li><li><p><strong> Harris’s Run for Governor?: </strong>Former Vice President Kamala Harris did not appear in person at a California state Democratic convention, leaving <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/01/us/politics/california-democrats-kamala-harris-governor.html">delegates to wonder how seriously she is considering running</a> and whether it would be wise.</p></li><li><p><strong>Walz’s Atonement Tour: </strong>Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota and last year’s Democratic vice-presidential nominee, is going to Republican areas where Democrats lost ground in the 2024 election, sitting for countless interviews and is among the few <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/01/us/politics/tim-walz-democrats-2024.html">Democrats admitting that they themselves made mistakes.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Democrats’ Age Problem:</strong> After former President Biden’s cancer diagnosis and Representative Gerry Connolly’s death, some in the party want more elected officials, as one Democrat put it, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/democrats-age-biden-cancer-connolly.html">seek an earlier “escape hatch from politics</a>.”</p></li><li><p><strong> A Way Forward?:</strong> The Democratic party’s standing is startlingly low after a defeat that felt like a cultural rejection.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wind and Solar Energy in Texas:</strong> Despite soaring power demand, Republican lawmakers in the Texas Legislature are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/us/politics/renewable-energy-republicans.html">pushing to rein in renewable energy</a>, part of a national wave of Trump-era opposition.</p></li><li><p><strong>Concerns for Arizona Democrats:</strong> The party is worried about the re-election chances of Gov.
