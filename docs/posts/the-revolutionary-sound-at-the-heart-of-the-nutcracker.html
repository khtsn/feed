Under the surface, though, keyboard instruments vary widely.</p><p>Take the harpsichord, a reigning keyboard instrument of the Baroque. To play it, you press a key, which triggers an action to pluck a string inside the wooden, boxlike frame. The <strong>resulting sound is bright and short lived</strong>. With the modern piano, a key is pressed to hammer a string inside; more sensitive and sophisticated than a harpsichord, the piano <strong>allows for different colors and degrees of strength</strong>, as well as the ability to sustain a note.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-8"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/27/celesta-promo-74374-cover/celesta-promo-74374-cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Unmute to listen.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Vincent Tullo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The celesta came much later, invented by the Parisian organ-maker Auguste Mustel in 1886. It is smaller than the piano, almost a toy by comparison, and with a less expansive keyboard. Mustel’s innovation was to have the keys set off an action that, rather than plucking or hammering strings, hammered a small metal bar over wooden resonators. Picture a <a href="https://www.vsl.co.at/academy/percussion/glockenspiel" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">glockenspiel</a>, a mainstay of orchestral percussion sections, hidden inside a piano.</p><p>Celestas and glockenspiels have quite different sounds, though. The celesta is softer and is a transposing instrument, meaning that its pitch is always an octave higher than the notes on the page. Early listeners, hearing its fanciful tone and silvery timbre, found it more astral than other keyboard instruments, which led to its name: celesta, or heavenly.</p><p>Tchaikovsky, heard the celesta in Paris while on his way to the United States, the historian Simon Morrison writes in his recent biography <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300192100/tchaikovskys-empire/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Tchaikovsky’s Empire.”</a> The composer described the experience in an 1891 letter to his publisher:</p><blockquote><p>I discovered a new orchestral instrument in Paris, something between a miniature piano and a Glockenspiel, with a divinely wondrous sound. … The instrument is called the “Celesta Mustel” and costs 1,200 francs. It can be obtained only from its Paris inventor, M. Mustel. I’m hoping you’ll order this instrument for me.</p></blockquote><p>The instrument, Tchaikovsky predicted, would “have a colossal effect.” And he already knew how he would use it. He alluded to “The Nutcracker,” planned for fall 1892, but expressed a more immediate need “next season” for his symphonic ballad “The Voyevoda.” He asked that his publisher not show the celesta to anyone else. “I fear,” he wrote, “that Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov will hear about it and deploy its extraordinary effects before I get to do so.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The interior of a celesta.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vincent Tullo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Little did Tchaikovsky know, another composer had already incorporated the celesta into an orchestra: Ernest Chausson. In 1888, Chausson wrote a small part for the instrument <strong>in his incidental music</strong> for a production of Shakespeare’s “The Tempest” in Paris.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Chausson’s “Tempest” music has never been widely performed, however, and the celesta didn’t enter a full-scale symphony orchestra until <strong>Tchaikovsky premiered his “Voyevoda,”</strong> in 1891. Like Chausson, he seems to have been most attracted to its sound in arpeggios, or chords broken up into runs of individual notes.</p><p>“The Voyevoda” is scarcely heard today. And it isn’t the best showcase for the celesta; it wasn’t until “The Nutcracker” that Tchaikovsky unleashed the instrument’s full potential. In “The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy,” he at first treats it almost as a piano, with <strong>phrases as quick and light-footed as a ballerina on pointe</strong>. No longer background color, the celesta becomes, for the first time, the center of attention.</p><p>When Tchaikovsky has the celesta begin a string of arpeggios, it’s not as a texture to support other instruments, but as <strong>a solo passage similar to a cadenza</strong> in a concerto. The effect is of a dreamy whirlwind that leads to the initial melody, but twinkling an octave higher than before. Then, in the coda, the celesta <strong>dashes to the finish line</strong>, with both of the sounds it has used throughout the dance: fast runs of notes over light pricks of harmony.</p><p>It wasn’t long before other composers fell for the celesta. (Mahler requested that there be not one, but three if possible in performances of his Sixth Symphony.) And they often followed Tchaikovsky’s example of using the instrument to fantastical effect.</p><p>Richard Strauss deployed the celesta’s sound in the <strong>lustrous, dreamy Presentation of the Rose</strong> scene of his opera “Der Rosenkavalier.” Similarly heady is <strong>a passage from Gershwin’s “An American in Paris”</strong> that incorporates the instrument. Bartok included it in his <strong>idiosyncratically orchestrated “Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta,”</strong> harking back to the era of celesta arpeggios as a source of soft color.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kim at the celesta.

It has been woven into songs by Kate Bush and Björk, Paul McCartney and Pink Floyd. Perhaps most famously, it <strong>quaintly opens Buddy Holly’s “Everyday”</strong> and joyously bobs, not unlike the Sugar Plum Fairy’s dance, at the start of <strong>Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell’s “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough.”</strong></p><p>Truest to Tchaikovsky’s treatment of the celesta in “The Nutcracker,” as a vehicle for fantasy, has been the instrument’s appearance in film soundtracks. In the 1971 musical “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,” a celesta <strong>hypnotically sparkles as Wonka sings “Pure Imagination,”</strong> introducing visitors to the chocolate river and candy-coated landscape of his factory.</p><p>In the 21st century, the celesta may be most closely associated with a work of fantasy that rivals “The Nutcracker” in popularity: the Harry Potter films. The first three were scored by John Williams, the reigning composer of symphonic movie soundtracks, with an encyclopedic and reverential sense of how classical music can shape franchises like “Jaws,” “Star Wars” and “Home Alone.”</p><p>The film adaptation of “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” opens with the defining musical motif of the series, a <strong>celesta melody called “Hedwig’s Theme.”</strong> You could describe this tune with the same language you would use for “The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy”: toylike in its fun and transporting in its allure. Above all, it is magical.</p><p>Instruments have a way of quickly conjuring moods and images, and that’s largely because of how they’ve been used in the past. The English horn is nostalgic; the French horn, noble. And if “Hedwig’s Theme” immediately brings the world of magic to mind, that association was planted by Tchaikovsky well over a century ago in “The Nutcracker.”</p><p><strong>Audio credits:</strong> Mariinsky Orchestra and Valery Gergiev, “Dance of the Sugar-Plum Fairy” (Philips); Jean Rondeau, “J.S.
