An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/business/social-security-undocumented-immigrants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;sgrp=c&amp;pvid=DC75AA51-46AE-4B30-8F7F-708A22CB9081" title="">analysis</a> by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that in 2022, undocumented immigrants contributed more than $25 billion in Social Security taxes. Those funds effectively act as a subsidy for American beneficiaries.</p><p>Mr. Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/us/politics/doge-musk-contracts-errors.html" title="">has frequently seized on</a> limited discoveries over the course of his audits of federal agencies, publicizing minor accounting hiccups as evidence of systematic fraud.</p><p>He and Mr. Trump have already done so with Social Security, trumpeting a finding that tens of millions of people born over a century ago remain in the Social Security Administration databases with no recorded date of death. But while both men have pointed to that as evidence of widespread fraud, the issue is well-known, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/upshot/social-security-fraud-claim-musk.html" title="">almost none of those people listed</a> are recorded as receiving payments from the agency.</p><p>Democrats have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/musk-social-security-democrats.html" title="">criticized</a> Mr. Musk’s apparent appetite to scrutinize entitlement programs, whose popularity has been durable. They have described the efforts as a thinly veiled attempt to pare back programs that millions of retirees depend upon. Previous Republican <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/17/us/reagan-weighs-new-benefit-cuts-including-one-for-social-security.html" title="">attempts</a> to whittle down those programs proved to be a political third rail and had been abandoned after public pushback.</p><p>During the interview, Mr. Musk repeated claims he has made in recent weeks that his team’s goal was to “defeat” what he described as “rule by the bureau,” in which he said civil servants have worked to “thwart presidential policy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He said that his team had scrutinized “pretty much” every federal agency in what he referred to as “tech support” for the departments being cut.</p><p>Even as lawsuits have moved forward in federal court challenging the constitutionality of Mr. Musk’s cost-cutting initiatives, he said his team may well remain in place for another year.</p><p>“I mean, frankly, I can’t believe I’m here doing this, it’s kind of bizarre,” he said.</p><p>“Really I just don’t want America to go bankrupt,” he added.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zach Montague is a Times reporter covering the U.S. Department of Education, the White House and federal courts.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague">More about Zach Montague</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/social-security-administration">Social Security Administration</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/centers-for-medicare-and-medicaid-services">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/fox-entertainment-group-inc">Fox Entertainment Group, Inc.</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>St. Louis’s Growth Strategy: </strong>Shrinking cities have tried to stabilize their populations with foreign-born residents. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/business/economy/trump-immigration-st-louis.html">The strategy was working, until the inauguration</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>South African Farmers: </strong>The United States will immediately start offering a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/africa/trump-south-africa-farmers-citizenship.html">rapid pathway to citizenship for South African farmers</a>, President Trump said in a social media post, falsely claiming that South Africa’s government was confiscating their land.</p></li><li><p><strong>Private Prisons Are Cashing In: </strong>CoreCivic, GEO Group and some smaller private prison companies are becoming a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/us/politics/private-prisons-immigrants-detention-trump.html">key cog in the Trump administration’s plan</a> to hold and then deport vast numbers of undocumented immigrants.</p></li><li><p><strong> Homeland Security and I.R.S.: </strong>The Department of Homeland Security has pushed the Internal Revenue Service to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/irs-immigrants-addresses.html">turn over the addresses of roughly 700,000 undocumented immigrants</a> it is seeking to deport, according to three people familiar with the matter.
