There’s no trees. It’s just water. There’s nothing left. We have one suitcase, really. And so trying to figure out four people and a dog out of one suitcase is just surreal. When it comes to where we’re going to go from here, I guess anywhere but here. I don’t see anything to go back to. The firefighters are telling us it’s going to be at least six months before we see our house again. And, frankly, I doubt very much that it’ll be that fast.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/01/multimedia/01nat-helene-aftermath-bhql/01nat-helene-aftermath-bhql-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Hurricane Helene left Aaron Smith, his wife, two sons and dog with nothing but a single suitcase.

Roy Cooper said at a news conference on Tuesday, adding that 92 search-and-rescue teams were working across the state.</p><p>More than 130 people across six states died as a result of the storm, and the toll was expected to rise. Almost a third of those killed were in the county surrounding Asheville, N.C., where an unknown number of people were still unaccounted for on Tuesday.</p><p>The military has joined the relief and rescue efforts. Maj. Gen. Todd Hunt, the head of the North Carolina National Guard, said 800 soldiers were on duty as of Tuesday morning, pushing into more cutoff parts of the state. “By this afternoon,” he said, “we should have guardsmen in every affected county.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Rescue efforts across southern Appalachia were complicated by the many roads that had, until recently, served as lifelines for small mountain towns. Hundreds of roads were flooded, destroyed or blocked by debris. In some parts of the Carolinas, power remained scarce after flooding from the storm <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/climate/helene-hurricane-power-carolinas.html" title="">submerged electrical substations</a>, and cellphone service was spotty or nonexistent in many places.</p><p>The scope of the damage left state and federal politicians reaching for superlatives on Monday. Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia said that the storm was “unprecedented.” Mr. Cooper described the destruction in North Carolina as “beyond belief.” Vice President Kamala Harris called the damage “heartbreaking,” and President Biden said the hurricane was “history-making.”</p><p>Mr. Biden has promised long-term aid, and the White House announced that he would visit North Carolina and South Carolina on Wednesday. He also said that he planned to visit Florida and Georgia as soon as possible.</p><p>Helene made landfall in northwestern Florida on Thursday as a Category 4 storm, with winds of 140 miles per hour. It caused record-breaking storm surges in the Tampa Bay region of Florida, flash flooding in Atlanta and power outages as far north as Cincinnati.</p><p>Across the South, strong winds toppled trees. Tornadoes destroyed homes. Flash floods overwhelmed entire neighborhoods, and landslides destroyed public infrastructure, including for drinking water, which remains a key concern for emergency workers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Water systems in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/asheville-hurricane-helene-damage.html" title="">rapidly growing city of Asheville</a> were badly damaged, and officials said that restoring the full system could take weeks. Officials were working to truck in drinkable water for the city’s 94,000 residents.</p><p>“This crisis will likely be a sustained crisis, because of water system issues,” Mr. Cooper said on Tuesday.</p><p>The Gilded Age-era Biltmore Estate in Asheville, one of the region’s best-known landmarks and tourist attractions, was <a href="https://www.biltmore.com/weather-update/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">closed indefinitely</a> to assess property damage, its owners said on Monday. But commercial air travel <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FlyAVL/posts/pfbid031mzTB3YM3LmGt6DwTjZfdBqfyLRkkbBJbDRZDGS9KqJYuHvdHSc8Xh1KXnfNseFHl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had resumed</a> at the Asheville Regional Airport as of Tuesday morning, though there were still some cancellations.</p><p>For days, unreliable power and phone service have posed major problems, making it hard for officials to know the extent of the damage in some hard-to-reach spots. More than 1.5 million electricity customers from Florida to West Virginia were still without power on Tuesday, according to the tracking site <a href="http://poweroutage.us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poweroutage.us</a>.</p><p>More than 2,000 people were staying in shelters in Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas and Tennessee on Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, with nearly half of those in North Carolina.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Mark Barrett<!-- --> from Gerton, N.C.; <!-- -->Zolan Kanno-Youngs<!-- --> from the White House; <!-- -->Eduardo Medina<!-- --> from Asheville, N.C.; and <!-- -->Ivan Penn<!-- --> from Los Angeles.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jacey Fortin covers a wide range of subjects for the National desk of The Times, including extreme weather, court cases and state politics all across the country.<span> </span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/federal-emergency-management-agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/roy-cooper">Roy Cooper</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/brian-kemp">Brian Kemp</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/10/01/us/helene-storm-north-carolina-aftermath.html">241</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/10/01/us/helene-storm-north-carolina-aftermath.html">241</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
