There are now around 6,000 officers focused on deportation efforts at Immigration and Custom Enforcement.</p><p>Mr. Trump has pushed to deputize state and local law enforcement officers for immigration enforcement before, and Department of Homeland Security officials have already signed a series of agreements with local law enforcement in the months since took office. Late last month, local law enforcement officials in Florida assisted ICE in an operation that led to the arrest of more than 1,100 migrants across the state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Trump administration has spent the past few months attempting to make good on the president’s promise of mass deportations by conducting sweeping raids in major cities, arresting international students and allowing officers more freedom where they make arrests, like in courthouses. But it has still struggled to reach the pace that would be necessary for Mr. Trump’s expansive deportation goals. </p><p>In recent weeks, the Trump administration has turned to pushing for migrants to leave the country on their own accord, a concept known as “self-deportation.” Earlier this week, department officials said they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/trump-immigrant-deportation-payments.html" title="">would pay migrants $1,000</a> and the cost of their travel if they left the country voluntarily and used a government app to do so.</p><p>In his proclamation Friday, Mr. Trump repeated that call, labeling it “project homecoming.”</p><p>“This proclamation establishes Project Homecoming, which will present illegal aliens with a choice: either leave the United States voluntarily, with the support and financial assistance of the federal government, or remain and face the consequences,” the proclamation read.</p><p>Mr. Trump ordered the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department to begin a “nationwide communications campaign” to tell migrants of the self-deportation offer and to warn them that not doing so would lead to stiffer consequences.</p><p>Beyond being arrested and deported, the proclamation warned that migrants could face “fines as consistent with applicable law for immigration-related crimes; the garnishment of wages; and the confiscation of savings and personal property, including homes and vehicles.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy for The Times.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Habeas Corpus:</strong> Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff who orchestrated President Trump’s crackdown on immigration, said that the administration was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/trump-habeas-corpus.html">considering suspending immigrants’ right to challenge their detention in court</a> before being deported.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia: </strong>Gang experts say the tattoos on Abrego Garcia’s knuckles are unlikely to signify gang membership. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/kilmar-abrego-garcia-tattoos-ms-13.html">The president says otherwise</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deported Before Trial</strong>: As President Trump pushes forward on his pledge to carry out mass deportations, U.S. immigration agents are detaining and deporting some criminal defendants <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/criminal-defendants-immigration-deportation.html">before their cases can move through the courts</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Skipping Medical Care:</strong> Doctors, nurses and social workers are concerned that people with serious medical conditions are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/health/migrants-health-care-trump.html">forgoing medical care out of fear of being apprehended</a> by immigration officials.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rumeysa Ozturk:</strong> The Tufts University doctoral student who was arrested by masked federal agents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/rumeysa-ozturk-tufts-detention-vermont.html">must be returned to Vermont</a> from a detention facility in Louisiana, a federal appellate court said.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Conditional Welcome:</strong> The Trump administration says foreign soccer fans considering attending next year’s FIFA World Cup are welcome to visit for a good time, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/politics/trump-world-cup-visitors.html">but not a long time</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
