He was 69.</p><p>His brother, Robert, said the cause was probably a heart attack.</p><p>Mr. Feinstein’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/03/13/tom-izzo-michigan-state/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">last column</a>, about Michigan State men’s basketball coach, Tom Izzo, appeared in The Post on Thursday.</p><p>Mr. Feinstein became one of America’s best-known sportswriters after “A Season on the Brink,” which focused on the 1985-86 Indiana University basketball team led by the mercurial coach Bobby Knight, became a best seller. The book gave readers the kind of journalistic access to Mr. Knight, a brilliant tactician but a complicated personality, that sports books usually did not offer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Although Mr. Knight didn’t speak to Mr. Feinstein for eight years after the book’s publication — angry about all the profanity that spilled from his mouth and onto its pages — Mr. Feinstein praised the coach after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/sports/ncaabasketball/bobby-knight-dead.html" title="">his death in 2023</a> for boosting his career.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Feinstein’s “A Season on the Brink” focused on the 1985-86 Indiana University basketball team led by the mercurial coach Bobby Knight.

He was especially well known for his insightful portraits of athletes and coaches.</p><p>His most recent books include two published last year: “Five Banners: Inside the Duke Dynasty” (he graduated from Duke University in 1977) and “The Ancient Eight: College Football’s Ivy League and the Game They Play Today.” He also wrote novels for young readers; his “Last Shot: A Final Four Mystery,” won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for best young-adult book in 2006.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-6"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Feinstein’s account of basketball at Duke University was one of two books he published last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Duke University Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>His book on Ivy League football was also published in 2024.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Grand Central Publishing</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>And he contributed commentary to NPR, ESPN and the Golf Channel.</p><p>At his death, he had been working on a book about what makes a successful coach.</p><p>His family knew about his work ethic from a young age.</p><p>“He was a cuckoo head — seriously,” Robert Feinstein said in a phone interview. “He would watch Met games and keep a box score of every game he watched — and he did that forever.”</p><p>John Feinstein was born on July 28, 1955, in Manhattan. His father, Martin, was the executive director of performing arts at the Kennedy Center and general director of the Washington Opera. His mother, Bernice (Richman) Feinstein, was a music professor at George Washington University.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Feinstein at a college basketball game  in 2011.

And while attending Duke, he wrote about sports — initially fencing and wrestling — for The Chronicle, a daily student newspaper, and eventually contributed freelance articles to The Washington Post. He recalled having the idea for “A Season on the Brink” years before Mr. Knight let him follow the Hoosiers.</p><p>“While I was in college, because I was an ex-jock, I hung out with a lot of basketball players, though Duke wasn’t any good back then,” <a href="https://povichcenter.umd.edu/still-no-cheering-press-box/chapter/John-Feinstein/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said in an interview with the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism</a>. “I knew the inner workings most people didn’t know. It gave me the idea that a book about what’s really going on behind the scenes would be great.”</p><p>After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in history in 1977, Mr. Feinstein joined The Post as a summer intern in the sports department; over his first two years, he worked as a night police reporter, then covered the police and the courts before returning to sports to cover the University of Maryland’s football and basketball teams.</p><p>“He was a challenge, he was feisty, and he had a lot of good ideas,” George Solomon, The Post’s former sports editor, said in an interview. “One time he threatened to kill my night editor, Mark Asher, if he changed one word of his story. Asher, of course, cut the last paragraph.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Feinstein on the sidelines of a game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh in 2004.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">George Gojkovich/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Solomon said he got a call from Mr. Knight after the publication of “A Season on The Brink.”</p><p>“Knight says, ‘Why did you hire that guy?’” he recalled. “I said, ‘I can’t give you an answer.’”</p><p>For the rest of his career, Mr. Feinstein juggled writing books with his work at The Post, first as a reporter and then as a columnist.</p><p>His other books included “A Season Inside: One Year in College Basketball” (1988); “Hard Courts: Real Life on the Professional Tennis Tour” (1991); “Living on the Black: Two Pitchers, Two Teams, One Season to Remember” (2008), which focused on the pitchers Tom Glavine of the Mets and Mike Mussina of the Yankees; and “The First Major: The Inside Story of the Ryder Cup” (2016).</p><p>His book on professional golf, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/11/books/the-grand-tour.html" title="">A Good Walk Spoiled,”</a> taking its title from a line by Mark Twain, profiled about a dozen players over 15 months on the PGA Tour.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Feinstein’s 1995 book about professional golf profiled about a dozen golfers over 15 months.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Little, Brown</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Esther Newberg, Mr. Feinstein’s former agent, said in an interview that his nearly ceaseless work took a physical toll on him.</p><p>“He had gout and diabetes,” she said. “He hated to fly and would drive to places like the Final Four from D.C. if it were in Indianapolis, which didn’t help his bad eating habits.</p><p>“But he was a reporter on deadline. He couldn’t help himself.”</p><p>In addition to his brother, Mr. Feinstein is survived by his wife, Christine (Bausch) Feinstein, and their daughter, Jane Feinstein; a son, Danny, and a daughter, Brigid Feinstein, from his marriage to Mary Givens, which ended in divorce; and a sister, Margaret Feinstein.</p><p>In 2004, Mr. Feinstein collaborated with Red Auerbach, the cigar-wielding architect of the Boston Celtics, on “Let Me Tell You a Story: A Lifetime in the Game” (2004). The book was an outgrowth of Mr. Auerbach’s storytelling at luncheons with friends at a restaurant in Washington, which Mr. Feinstein joined as a regular.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Feinstein collaborated with Red Auerbach, the longtime Boston Celtics coach and executive, on this 2004 book.

I took 2.’</p><p>“Everyone laughs. The check is delivered to Auerbach. He lights his cigar — once it was to announce a victory, now it is to announce that lunch is over — waves the cigar and says, ‘Let me tell you a story about the cardinal. …’”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
