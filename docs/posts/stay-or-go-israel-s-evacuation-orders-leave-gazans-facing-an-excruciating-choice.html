The move suggested that some people had remained in their homes even after the Israeli military had urged them to leave.</p><p>Since the two-month cease-fire between Israel and Hamas collapsed in March, Israel has issued a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-rafah.html" title="">succession of orders</a> across Gaza, covering roughly half of the territory. The orders have left Palestinians in the north, many of whom <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/world/middleeast/northern-gaza-palestinians-return.html" title="">returned home</a> when the truce came into effect, debating whether to stay in their neighborhoods despite the danger or to leave and yet again face the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/21/world/israel-gaza-war-hamas-rafah" title="">miserable conditions of displacement</a>.</p><p>While the United Nations has said that over 390,000 people have been displaced in recent weeks, the exact number of people remaining in evacuation zones was unclear.</p><p>“We don’t want to leave,” said Ahmad al-Masri, 26, a resident of Beit Lahia in northern Gaza who has spurned evacuation orders for his town. “Where will we go? It’s so very tiring.”</p><p>In some parts of Gaza, the military has called for people to leave and later invaded by ground. In other areas, it has put out evacuation orders, but has not sent in infantry. At least some Palestinians who have disregarded evacuation orders said they would leave if Israeli tanks move into their neighborhoods.</p><p>“I’m dealing with the reality on the ground,” Mr. al-Masri said.</p><p>Since the cease-fire broke down, the Israeli military has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-attack-gaza-hamas.html" title="">embarked on a major bombing campaign</a> and seized territory in a tactic that Israeli officials have said was intended <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-hostages.html" title="">to compel Hamas to release more hostages</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mourning on Wednesday after a strike in the Shajaiye neighborhood.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Adding to the uncertainty, Arab mediators and the United States have struggled to bridge gaps between Hamas and Israel to restore the cease-fire and to bring about exchanges of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.</p><p>Over the course of the war, Palestinians have endured a marathon of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-talks-emotion.html" title="">hope and heartbreak</a> as mediators have expressed optimism about talks only for a deal to remain elusive, or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-gaza-cease-fire-hamas.html" title="">fall apart completely</a>.</p><p>On Thursday, President Trump suggested that a new agreement could be in the offing. “We’re getting close to getting them back,” Mr. Trump told reporters at a meeting of his cabinet, referring to hostages.</p><p>The American president did not offer specific details, and representatives for Hamas and the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel did not immediately return requests for comment.</p><p>The military said its recent campaign had dismantled weapons infrastructure and killed militants. On Thursday, the Israeli military said that a day earlier in Gaza City’s Shajaiye neighborhood it had killed a Hamas commander who had participated in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Hamas did not comment on the claim.</p><p>The Palestinian Civil Defense, an emergency rescue service under the Hamas-run Interior Ministry, said that 23 people had been killed in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-city-strike-hamas.html" title="">strikes in Shajaiye on Wednesday</a>, without distinguishing between civilians and combatants. Israel has said that Hamas embeds in civilian areas, though legal experts say that it still has an obligation to protect civilians.</p><p>“The Israel Defense Forces is acting with great force in your areas to destroy the terrorist infrastructure,” Avichay Adraee, the Arabic-language spokesman for the military, said on Friday, announcing the evacuation orders for eastern Gaza City.</p><p>The Israeli offensive has included evacuation orders encompassing roughly half of the territory, according to a New York Times analysis of Israeli military maps. Satellite imagery also shows that the Israeli military is taking over Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza, with forces closing in from two directions.</p><p>More than 1,500 people in Gaza have been killed since the cease-fire fell apart and more than 50,000 people have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Gaza health ministry. The ministry also does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its casualty counts. Doctors at hospitals have said many of those wounded and killed in recent weeks have been children.</p><p>The United Nations said Friday that Israel’s actions in Gaza increasingly threatened the ability of Palestinians to continue living in the territory. Since mid-March, Israel has issued 21 evacuation orders to Palestinians in Gaza and launched some 224 attacks on Gaza residential buildings and tents, Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for the U.N. human rights chief, Volker Türk, told reporters on Friday.</p><p>“The death, the destruction, the displacement, the denial of access to basic necessities within Gaza and the repeated suggestion that Gazans should leave the territory entirely raise real concerns as to the future viability of Palestinians as a group in Gaza,” she said.</p><p>Nick Cumming-Bruce<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.</p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of Tensions in the Middle East</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> The Death of a Palestinian American Boy:</strong> Amer Rabee, 14, was fatally shot by Israeli forces in the West Bank, according to his family. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/nyregion/nj-amer-rabee-killed-west-bank.html">Community leaders gathered</a> in New Jersey to demand justice.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Strikes in Yemen:</strong> U.S. commanders planning for a possible conflict with China are increasingly concerned that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/china-weapons-yemen-bombing.html">bombing campaign in Yemen</a> is draining arms needed to deter China.</p></li><li><p><strong>‘The Floodgates of Horror’:</strong> The U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, sharply criticized Israel’s renewed blockade of aid to Gaza as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/middleeast/guterres-israel-gaza-blockade.html">a violation of its obligations</a> under international law.</p></li><li><p><strong>Netanyahu Faces Fewer Restraints</strong><strong>:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/middleeast/trump-netanyahu-israel-gaza.html">President Trump is more aligned than his predecessor</a> on Gaza with the aims of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his right-wing coalition.</p></li><li><p><strong>Skepticism About U.S.-Iran Talks</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/middleeast/israel-iran-reaction.html">Many Israelis were surprised</a> when Trump announced that the United States would engage in “direct” negotiations with Iran in an effort <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/europe/iran-nuclear-sanctions-trump.html">to rein in the country’s nuclear</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/europe/iran-nuclear-sanctions-trump.html"> program.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Attempt to Fire Israeli Spy Chief:</strong> Israel’s highest court gave Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government a deadline to find a compromise over his firing of one of his top intelligence chiefs, part of a courtroom battle that could lead to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/middleeast/israel-supreme-court-spy-chief.html">a constitutional crisis</a>..</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
