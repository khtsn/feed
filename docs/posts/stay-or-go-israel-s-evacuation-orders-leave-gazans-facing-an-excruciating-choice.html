The move suggested that some people had remained in their homes even after the Israeli military had urged them to leave.</p><p>Since the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas collapsed in March, Israel has issued a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-rafah.html" title="">succession of evacuation orders</a> across Gaza as it takes territory to create what it calls a “security zone” and targets Hamas. The orders have left many Palestinians debating whether to stay in their neighborhoods despite the danger or leave despite the miserable conditions of displacement.</p><p>While the United Nations has said that 390,000 people have been displaced in recent weeks, the exact number of people remaining in evacuation zones was unclear.</p><p>“We don’t want to leave,” said Ahmad al-Masri, 26, a resident of Beit Lahia in northern Gaza who has spurned evacuation orders for his town. “Where will we go? It’s so very tiring.”</p><p>In some parts of Gaza, the military has issued evacuation orders and later invaded by ground. In other areas, it has put out evacuation orders, but has not sent in infantry. At least some Palestinians who have disregarded evacuation orders said they would leave if Israeli tanks move into their neighborhoods.</p><p>“I’m dealing with the reality on the ground,” Mr. al-Masri said.</p><p>Since the cease-fire broke down, the Israeli military has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-attack-gaza-hamas.html" title="">embarked on a major bombing campaign</a> and seized territory in a tactic that Israeli officials have said was intended <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-hostages.html" title="">to compel Hamas to release more hostages</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mourning on Wednesday after a strike in the Shajaiye neighborhood.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The military said its recent campaign had dismantled weapons infrastructure and killed militants. On Thursday, the Israeli military said that it had killed a Hamas commander in Gaza City’s Shajaiye neighborhood a day earlier, who had participated in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel. The Palestinian Civil Defense, an emergency rescue service under the Hamas-run Interior Ministry, said that 23 people had been killed in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-city-strike-hamas.html" title="">strikes in Shajaiye on Wednesday</a>, without distinguishing between civilians and combatants.</p><p>“The Israel Defense Forces is acting with great force in your areas to destroy the terrorist infrastructure,” Avichay Adraee, the Arabic-language spokesman for the military, said on Friday, announcing the evacuation orders for eastern Gaza City.</p><p>The Israeli offensive has included evacuation orders encompassing roughly half of the territory, according to a New York Times analysis of Israeli military maps. Satellite imagery also shows that the Israeli military was taking over Rafah, with forces closing in on the southernmost city in Gaza from two directions.</p><p>More than 1,500 people in Gaza have been killed since the cease-fire fell apart and more than 50,000 people have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Gaza health ministry. The ministry also does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its casualty counts. Doctors at hospitals have said many of those wounded and killed in recent weeks have been children.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of Tensions in the Middle East</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> The Death of a Palestinian American Boy:</strong> Amer Rabee, 14, was fatally shot by Israeli forces in the West Bank, according to his family. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/nyregion/nj-amer-rabee-killed-west-bank.html">Community leaders gathered</a> in New Jersey to demand justice.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Strikes in Yemen:</strong> U.S. commanders planning for a possible conflict with China are increasingly concerned that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/china-weapons-yemen-bombing.html">bombing campaign in Yemen</a> is draining arms needed to deter China.</p></li><li><p><strong>‘The Floodgates of Horror’:</strong> The U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, sharply criticized Israel’s renewed blockade of aid to Gaza as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/middleeast/guterres-israel-gaza-blockade.html">a violation of its obligations</a> under international law.</p></li><li><p><strong>Netanyahu Faces Fewer Restraints</strong><strong>:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/middleeast/trump-netanyahu-israel-gaza.html">President Trump is more aligned than his predecessor</a> on Gaza with the aims of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his right-wing coalition.</p></li><li><p><strong>Skepticism About U.S.-Iran Talks</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/middleeast/israel-iran-reaction.html">Many Israelis were surprised</a> when Trump announced that the United States would engage in “direct” negotiations with Iran in an effort <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/europe/iran-nuclear-sanctions-trump.html">to rein in the country’s nuclear</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/europe/iran-nuclear-sanctions-trump.html"> program.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Attempt to Fire Israeli Spy Chief:</strong> Israel’s highest court gave Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government a deadline to find a compromise over his firing of one of his top intelligence chiefs, part of a courtroom battle that could lead to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/middleeast/israel-supreme-court-spy-chief.html">a constitutional crisis</a>..</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
