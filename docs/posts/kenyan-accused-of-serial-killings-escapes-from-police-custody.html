He said the actions of eight officers who were on duty at the time of the escape were being investigated.</p><p>The Kenyan police arrested the suspect, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/world/africa/kenya-serial-killer-women-arrest.html" title="">Collins Jumaisi Khalusha,</a> in July after dismembered bodies were discovered at an abandoned quarry in Nairobi, the capital. They said he had confessed to having killed 42 women over the past two years.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Khalusha escaped from his cell in the Gigiri police station in Nairobi, the police said, fleeing along with 12 Eritreans who had been accused of being in Kenya illegally. The police station is near the United States Embassy, a United Nations office and other diplomatic missions.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The discovery of the bodies in the quarry, which was being used as a dump, rattled the East African country during a period when it was already experiencing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/world/africa/kenya-protests-taxes.html" title="">political turmoil</a>. It also intensified concerns about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/world/africa/femicide-kenya-africa.html" title="">violence against women</a> in Kenya. </p><p>Mr. Khalusha confessed to having “lured, killed and disposed” of the women, according to a <a href="https://x.com/DCI_Kenya/status/1812781136055058853" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> in July by Mohamed I. Amin, who leads the Directorate of Criminal Investigations.</p><p>Mr. Khalusha’s lawyer, John Maina Ndegwa, said the confession had been made under duress. Mr. Ndegwa <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/20/world/africa/nairobi-kenya-serial-killer.html" title="">accused the police</a> of torturing and strangling his client.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Ndegwa said in a phone interview that the authorities had put duct tape over Mr. Khalusha’s mouth and sacks over his head during his confinement. </p><p>“I think, out of fear of his life, that’s when he made the confession,” the lawyer said.</p><p>He said he found out about his client’s escape on Tuesday morning,<span>  </span>when a colleague called to ask about it. “I was asking him: ‘What? What?’” Mr. Ndegwa said. Then he turned on the news.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“I was shocked,” he said.</p><p>The theory that Mr. Khalusha had inside help in his escape could make sense, Mr. Ndegwa said, describing the Gigiri police station as “highly secured.” He also said that Mr. Khalusha had told him that he often wore ankle shackles.</p><p>An escape on his own would have been “unrealistic,” Mr. Ndegwa said.</p><p>The escape was the latest turn in a grisly case that led to a rash of conjecture about who had killed the women — and about how someone could get away with so many killings for so long.</p><p>It will likely deepen the public’s suspicion of the Kenyan judicial system, said Zaina Kombo, an anti-discrimination campaigner with Amnesty International in Kenya. “This makes it even harder for people to believe in the justice system,” she said in a phone interview. </p><p>When the police unveiled details of the killings in July, they said that one of Mr. Khalusha’s victims was his wife. They accused him of strangling her and then disposing of her body at the dump, which was near a police station.</p><p>The police identified Mr. Khalusha as a suspect after doing a forensic analysis of a victim’s cellphone, they said. When they searched his house, they said, they recovered a machete, nylon sacks, industrial rubber gloves, multiple identification cards, women’s underwear and rope.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Ndegwa said he last saw Mr. Khalusha — who has not yet entered a plea — on Friday, during a court appearance. The two were set to appear in court again next week. </p><p>“I would have expected him to plead not guilty,” Mr. Ndegwa said.</p><p>The escape of the accused serial killer may stir further concerns over gender-based violence in Kenya. While Kenya’s judiciary has introduced special courts to handle cases of gender-based violence and sexual offenses, prosecution rates have remained low, said Ms. Kombo, of Amnesty International.</p><p>Ms. Kombo said that law enforcement’s handling of the killings signaled that the police still did not prioritize violence against women.</p><p>“It’s like women’s issues are second-class issues,” she said.</p><p>Mr. Khalusha’s lawyer said that for now, he has no real plan. His client has his contact information, Mr. Ndegwa said. So he will wait — like everyone else — to see if he surfaces.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lynsey Chutel covers South Africa and the countries that make up southern Africa from Johannesburg.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lynsey-chutel">More about Lynsey Chutel</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
