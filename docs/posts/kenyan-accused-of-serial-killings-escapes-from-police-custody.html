The police station is in a neighborhood that also includes the United States Embassy, a United Nations office and other diplomatic missions in the capital, Nairobi.</p><p>Mr. Khalusha’s arrest in July came after the discovery of dismembered bodies at an abandoned quarry in Nairobi, and the revelations rattled Kenya, an East African economic powerhouse, during a period of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/world/africa/kenya-protests-taxes.html" title="">political turmoil</a>.</p><p>The discovery intensified the horror and added to the urgency of tense national debates about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/world/africa/femicide-kenya-africa.html" title="">violence against Kenyan women</a>. A wave of killings, including at least 31 in January, prompted nationwide protests.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Khalusha confessed to having “lured, killed and disposed” of women, according to a <a href="https://x.com/DCI_Kenya/status/1812781136055058853" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> in July by Mohamed I. Amin, who heads the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. John Maina Ndegwa, Mr. Khalusha’s lawyer, accused the police of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/20/world/africa/nairobi-kenya-serial-killer.html" title="">torturing and strangling</a> his client into giving a confession.</p><p>One of Mr. Khalusha’s victims was his wife, the police said: He strangled her, then dismembered her body and disposed of it at the quarry, which was used as a dumping site — and was near a police station.</p><p>The police did a forensic analysis of a cellphone belonging to one of the victims to identify Mr. Khalusha. They recovered a machete, nylon sacks, industrial rubber gloves, multiple identification cards, women’s underwear and rope from his house, which was about 100 yards from the dump site, the statement read.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lynsey Chutel covers South Africa and the countries that make up southern Africa from Johannesburg.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lynsey-chutel">More about Lynsey Chutel</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
