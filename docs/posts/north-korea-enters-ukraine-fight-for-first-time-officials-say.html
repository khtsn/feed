    <h1>North Korea Enters Ukraine Fight for First Time, Officials Say</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Much of the rest of the force could enter the fight in the coming days, the senior Ukrainian official said. The North Korean troops, the official said, have been divided into two units — one made up of assault troops and another of support troops who will organize the defense of territory recaptured from Ukrainian forces.</p><p>There has been debate in Ukraine and among its allies about the military significance of the North Korean troops. Some officials have described their recruitment as an act of desperation by Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, whose forces continue to take territory in eastern Ukraine but at huge losses.</p><p>Others have said the decision to deploy the troops was meant to weaken Western resolve by showing that Russia remains far from isolated. The North Korean troops could also allow Russia to divert more of its forces to offensive operations on Ukrainian territory, in particular in the Donbas, where Russian troops are attempting to take as much territory as possible before the harsh winter sets in.</p><p>It is not clear what Mr. Putin promised Mr. Kim, if anything, in exchange for the troops. For now, American officials say they have seen no evidence of a quid pro quo. But there are concerns that Russia might provide some kind of significant military assistance that could enhance the danger North Korea poses to its neighbors and the United States.</p><p>Last week, North Korea <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/world/asia/north-korea-missile-launch.html" title="">launched an intercontinental ballistic missile</a> in the direction of Japan, setting off a new flurry of anxiety in the West.</p><p>In addition to its troops, North Korea has provided Russia 16,000 shipping containers full of artillery shells, rockets and missiles since the summer of 2023, according to U.S. and South Korean officials. In June, Mr. Putin met with Mr. Kim in Pyongyang, where they restored a Cold War-era treaty of mutual defense and military cooperation between their countries.</p></div></div>
