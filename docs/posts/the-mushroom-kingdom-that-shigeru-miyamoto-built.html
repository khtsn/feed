(His father, an English teacher from the Kyoto suburbs, had arranged an interview with Nintendo’s president at the time, Hiroshi Yamauchi.) Four years later, in 1981, Miyamoto made himself essential by inventing the Donkey Kong arcade cabinets, which introduced an early version of the character Mario and became an international hit.</p><p>“Mr. Yamauchi back in the day would tell us that we are not good at fighting: ‘We are weak — so don’t go picking fights with other companies,’” Miyamoto said, explaining the company’s longstanding pursuit of originality.</p><p>He shared that goal with Gunpei Yokoi, the inventor of the Game Boy, who worked with him on Donkey Kong. The working relationship was initially distant. “We talked and he provided feedback,” Miyamoto said. “Some critical feedback, as well.” But the colleagues grew close: Yokoi was a witness at his wedding, and Miyamoto said he remained in contact with the inventor’s widow.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tickets for the Nintendo Museum, which opens on Oct. 2, are sold via a lottery system.

When that happens, everyone starts to go in the same direction, but that is where Nintendo would rather go in a different direction.”</p><p>The museum itself represents the third and latest chapter of Nintendo’s history: its transformation from a video game company into a global entertainment brand. Through concrete and nostalgia, Nintendo is declaring — perhaps for the first time — that it sees itself as a permanent fixture in popular culture.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After the Wii U struggled to find an audience, Nintendo turned its fortunes around with the Switch.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Shiho Fukada for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Just a decade ago, industry analysts believed that Nintendo’s only chance of survival after the failed launch of the Wii U was to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/12/10/it-may-be-time-for-nintendo-to-make-games-not-consoles/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stop producing consoles</a> and focus on software development.

A toy rifle and a baby stroller are saved for a back display subtitled as the company’s “age of exploration.” The language is more direct in Japanese, describing a period from the company’s founding to as far ahead as into its video-game era as the “age of challenge.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The museum has almost no written explanations and Nintendo is not providing guided tours, leaving visitors without the context to know that licensed games like Twister and an early partnership with Disney were among the steps that allowed the company to negotiate its own products onto Japanese shelves. Additional research is necessary to learn that the Famicom, the precursor to the Nintendo Entertainment System, was on the cutting edge of technology in 1983: an online adapter allowed users to check the weather, conduct banking and place bets on horse races.</p><p>Miyamoto said the lack of explanations would allow visitors to intuitively understand Nintendo. “We wanted to make sure that this is someplace that regardless of any language or cultural barrier, people can come to interact and understand,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Goombas, Shy Guys, Boos and Koopa Troopas from the Mario franchise can be found throughout the museum.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Shiho Fukada for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The company was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/technology/nintendo-switch.html" title="">revived by the Nintendo Switch</a> in 2017. Initial games like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/04/arts/zelda-nintendo-history.html" title="">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> were critical and commercial successes. The coronavirus pandemic also coincided with the release of cozy games like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/arts/animal-crossing-covid-coronavirus-popularity-millennials.html" title="">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, which attracted casual players looking for a virtual taste of fresh air, or “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/learning/annotated-by-the-author-how-animal-crossing-will-save-gen-z.html" title="">essentially peace in electronic form</a>,” as one young player said. Both games exceeded Miyamoto’s sales target by millions of copies.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Miyamoto was also enacting a strategic plan to extend the Nintendo brand to new audiences and revenue streams. He now sits on the company’s board of directors but also holds the title of “Executive Fellow,” which at another company might be seen as the chief creative officer who oversees the development of new products.</p><p>After years of ignoring the surge in mobile gaming, the company developed apps like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/mario-nintendos-mustachioed-gaming-legend-arrives-on-iphones.html" title="">Super Mario Run</a>, which Miyamoto joked during a presentation with Apple could be played while eating a hamburger.
