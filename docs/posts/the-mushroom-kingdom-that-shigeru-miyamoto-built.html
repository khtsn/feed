    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Shigeru Miyamoto has been making the same request of all new employees at Nintendo for at least the past decade: For the love of all things Super Mario, please design games that <a href="https://www.1101.com/n/s/miyamoto_shigeru2024/2024-01-11.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">might sell 30 million copies</a>.</p><p>The request for smash hits that can generate upward of $1.5 billion sounds almost reasonable coming from Miyamoto, a smiling septuagenarian with arched eyebrows and a trove of beloved cultural properties that would make Walt Disney blush.</p><p>Despite creating mascots like Super Mario, Princess Zelda and Donkey Kong that have earned billions for Nintendo, Miyamoto dresses like a humble salaryman, wearing company merchandise beneath his blazer. He has consulted on dozens of games and was instrumental in the development of the Wii and Switch consoles, but in recent years has focused on the movies and amusement parks that Nintendo hopes will undergird its future.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“I actually don’t know why I create the things I create,” Miyamoto said through an interpreter during a private interview this week. “I’m just having fun and that is what drives me.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/25/multimedia/25nintendo-port-jkvc/25nintendo-port-jkvc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/25/multimedia/25nintendo-port-jkvc/25nintendo-port-jkvc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/25/multimedia/25nintendo-port-jkvc/25nintendo-port-jkvc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A man with graying hair wears a black blazer over a blue shirt that says Nintendo." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/25/multimedia/25nintendo-port-jkvc/25nintendo-port-jkvc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/25/multimedia/25nintendo-port-jkvc/25nintendo-port-jkvc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/25/multimedia/25nintendo-port-jkvc/25nintendo-port-jkvc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 683w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/25/multimedia/25nintendo-port-jkvc/25nintendo-port-jkvc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1366w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="900"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shigeru Miyamoto, who created video game mascots like Super Mario, Princess Zelda and Donkey Kong, is now often thinking about movies and amusement parks.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Shiho Fukada for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He was speaking from inside the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto, Japan, an exhibition hall that opens on Oct. 2 and documents the company’s evolution from a local storefront selling handmade playing cards in the 1880s to a video game company nearly a century later.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the museum is mostly dedicated to that second chapter, which opens on Miyamoto’s arrival at the company. (His father, an English teacher from the Kyoto suburbs, had arranged an interview with Nintendo’s president at the time, Hiroshi Yamauchi.) Four years later, in 1981, Miyamoto made himself essential by inventing the Donkey Kong arcade cabinets, which introduced an early version of the character Mario and became an international hit.</p><p>“Mr. Yamauchi back in the day would tell us that we are not good at fighting: ‘We are weak — so don’t go picking fights with other companies,’” Miyamoto said, explaining the company’s longstanding pursuit of originality.</p><p>He shared that goal with Gunpei Yokoi, the inventor of the Game Boy, who worked with him on Donkey Kong. The working relationship was initially distant. “We talked and he provided feedback,” Miyamoto said. “Some critical feedback, as well.” But the colleagues grew close: Yokoi was a witness at his wedding, and Miyamoto said he remained in contact with the inventor’s widow.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tickets for the Nintendo Museum, which opens on Oct. 2, are sold via a lottery system.

When that happens, everyone starts to go in the same direction, but that is where Nintendo would rather go in a different direction.”</p><p>The museum itself represents the third and latest chapter of Nintendo’s history: its transformation from a video game company into a global entertainment brand. Through concrete and nostalgia, Nintendo is declaring — perhaps for the first time — that it sees itself as a permanent fixture in popular culture.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After the Wii U struggled to find an audience, Nintendo turned its fortunes around with the Switch.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Shiho Fukada for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Just a decade ago, industry analysts believed that Nintendo’s only chance of survival after the failed launch of the Wii U was to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/12/10/it-may-be-time-for-nintendo-to-make-games-not-consoles/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stop producing consoles</a> and focus on software development. The press was brutal. “<a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/12/wii-u-sales/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">What the Hell Is Wrong With Nintendo?</a>” asked the Wired editor Chris Kohler. In 2013, Bloomberg News <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-02/nintendo-seen-missing-target-as-sony-microsoft-sales-dwarf-wii-u" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published an article</a> pointing out that Sony and Microsoft “each sold more consoles in 24 hours than the Wii U maker did in nine months.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>For the first time in its modern history, Nintendo — the first part of its name, “Ninten,” translates to “leave luck to heaven,” a gambling prayer — was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/technology/nintendo-hurt-by-new-rivals.html" title="">reporting annual financial losses to investors</a>.</p><p>A branding decision to piggyback off the name and considerable success of its previous console, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/technology/14wii.html" title="">the motion-controlled Wii</a>, left the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/03/rip-wii-u-nintendos-glorious-quirky-failure" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">market confused</a>.

A toy rifle and a baby stroller are saved for a back display subtitled as the company’s “age of exploration.” The language is more direct in Japanese, describing a period from the company’s founding to as far ahead as into its video-game era as the “age of challenge.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The museum has almost no written explanations and Nintendo is not providing guided tours, leaving visitors without the context to know that licensed games like Twister and an early partnership with Disney were among the steps that allowed the company to negotiate its own products onto Japanese shelves. Additional research is necessary to learn that the Famicom, the precursor to the Nintendo Entertainment System, was on the cutting edge of technology in 1983: an online adapter allowed users to check the weather, conduct banking and place bets on horse races.</p><p>Miyamoto said the lack of explanations would allow visitors to intuitively understand Nintendo. “We wanted to make sure that this is someplace that regardless of any language or cultural barrier, people can come to interact and understand,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Goombas, Shy Guys, Boos and Koopa Troopas from the Mario franchise can be found throughout the museum.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Shiho Fukada for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The company was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/technology/nintendo-switch.html" title="">revived by the Nintendo Switch</a> in 2017. Initial games like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/04/arts/zelda-nintendo-history.html" title="">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> were critical and commercial successes. The coronavirus pandemic also coincided with the release of cozy games like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/arts/animal-crossing-covid-coronavirus-popularity-millennials.html" title="">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, which attracted casual players looking for a virtual taste of fresh air, or “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/learning/annotated-by-the-author-how-animal-crossing-will-save-gen-z.html" title="">essentially peace in electronic form</a>,” as one young player said. Both games exceeded Miyamoto’s sales target by millions of copies.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Miyamoto was also enacting a strategic plan to extend the Nintendo brand to new audiences and revenue streams. He now sits on the company’s board of directors but also holds the title of “Executive Fellow,” which at another company might be seen as the chief creative officer who oversees the development of new products.</p><p>After years of ignoring the surge in mobile gaming, the company developed apps like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/mario-nintendos-mustachioed-gaming-legend-arrives-on-iphones.html" title="">Super Mario Run</a>, which Miyamoto joked during a presentation with Apple could be played while eating a hamburger. (In what appears to be a subtle reference, the museum cafe’s only main dish is burgers.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Miyamoto was also making trips to Hollywood to develop <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/05/movies/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review.html" title="">“The Super Mario Bros. Movie,”</a> which became the second-highest-grossing film of last year at nearly $1.4 billion. The movie released two months after the opening of Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios Hollywood, the second of four planned <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/business/super-nintendo-world-japan.html" title="">theme parks around the world</a>.

In another section, visitors can use comically large controllers to play old Nintendo games; extend a mechanical arm to grab balls; test their love matches with partners; and swing a cushioned bat around a fake living room.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The museum is mostly dedicated to the chapter after Shigeru Miyamoto arrived in the late 1970s.

But its Kyoto headquarters are shockingly sterile, housed inside a white rectangular office building with an interior design that Miyamoto has <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/shigeru-miyamoto-wants-to-create-a-kinder-world" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lovingly compared to a hospital waiting room</a>.</p><p>There are many tourists who travel to Kyoto to marvel at the nondescript building, even as the pagoda roofs of 800-year-old shrines like Tofuku-ji temple tower in the distance. Some Nintendo officials hope those tourists will now flock a few train stops away to the museum instead, though the company remains torn between discretion and transparency.</p><p>“When I put myself in the consumer&#39;s perspective, I kind of want to see behind the curtains,” Miyamoto admitted at the news conference.</p><p>“Creating a museum like this is very un-Nintendo-like,” he added. “If Mr. Yamauchi saw this, he would probably say don’t do it.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zachary Small is a Times reporter writing about the art world’s relationship to money, politics and technology.<span> </span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/09/25/arts/design/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-nintendo-museum.html">2</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the World of Video Games</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>What to Play Next?: </strong>For inspiration, read what <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/video-game-reviews-2024.html">our critics think about this year’s top games</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/video-game-recommendations.html">what our journalists have been enjoying</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nintendo Museum:</strong> Decades after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/arts/design/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-nintendo-museum.html">Shigeru Miyamoto created mascots</a> like Super Mario and Donkey Kong, his focus is on expanding Nintendo’s reach.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Magic Formula: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/arts/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review.html">Echoes of Wisdom</a> empowers Princess Zelda to create her own path with the help of a copy-pasting magic wand, our critic writes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fresh Franchise:</strong> The developers of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/arts/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sequel-playstation.html">Ghost of Yotei</a>, the anticipated sequel to Ghost of Tsushima, say it’s a story of “underdog vengeance” in northern Japan.</p></li><li><p><strong>Under Siege: </strong>As Russia invaded, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/arts/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-ukraine-war.html">a studio in Ukraine was making an anticipated survival shooter</a>.
