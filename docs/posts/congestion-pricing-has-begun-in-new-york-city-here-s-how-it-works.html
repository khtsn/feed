The plan will help generate $15 billion for crucial upgrades to the region’s mass transit system.</p><p>Congestion pricing had been halted abruptly in June when Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York stopped it just weeks before its original start date. At the time, Ms. Hochul expressed concerns that the tolls would negatively affect New York’s economy, an idea that was disputed by some experts. She later revived the politically unpopular program one week after November’s general election, this time with reduced tolls that are scheduled to increase in the years to come.</p><p>Here’s how the program will work:</p><ul><li><p><strong>When does the tolling start?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Where will drivers be charged?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How will drivers be billed?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How much will the tolls cost?</strong></p><p>Motorcyclists will pay $4.50 during peak hours and $1.05 off-peak.</p><p>Those driving smaller commercial trucks and some buses will pay a toll of $14.40 at peak hours and $3.60 at other times. Drivers of larger trucks and tour buses will be charged $21.60 at peak hours and $5.40 off-peak.</p></li><li><p><strong>What about taxis or Uber riders?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>When will tolls increase?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Are there exemptions, credits or discounts?</strong></p><p>During peak hours, drivers of passenger vehicles who enter Manhattan via four tunnels that already require tolls — the Lincoln, Holland, Hugh L. Carey and Queens-Midtown — will receive a credit of up to $3 against the daily congestion charge.</p></li><li><p><strong>Are the tolls a done deal?</strong></p><p>Groups of opponents in New Jersey and New York have also fought the tolls for more than a year through litigation that could stop the program even after it has begun. But federal judges have recently ruled against the plan’s opponents in several lawsuits.</p></li></ul></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ana Ley is a Times reporter covering New York City’s mass transit system and the millions of passengers who use it.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ana-ley">More about Ana Ley</a></span></p></div><div><p>Winnie Hu is a Times reporter covering the people and neighborhoods of New York City.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/winnie-hu">More about Winnie Hu</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
