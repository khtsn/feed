The local authorities were alerted to the man’s whereabouts by an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/nyregion/unitedhealthcare-ceo-suspect-arrest-altoona.html" title="">employee at the McDonald’s who recognized him</a> from photos shared by the police. He matched the description of the person suspected in the killing of the health executive, Brian Thompson, 50, chief of UnitedHealthcare.</p><p>Police said that Mangione was carrying a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/nyregion/ghost-guns.html?smid=url-share" title="">so-called ghost gun</a> with a silencer, a fake ID matching the one used by the suspected gunman and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/09/nyregion/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-news/the-man-detained-in-connection-with-the-shooting-had-a-handwritten-manifesto?smid=url-share" title="">handwritten manifesto criticizing health care companies</a> for putting profits above care.</p><p>Mangione was born and raised in Maryland, and has lived in San Francisco and Honolulu, the police said. He attended Gilman School, a private high school in Baltimore, where he wrestled and graduated in 2016 as the valedictorian.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Umayyad Square in Damascus, today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-5b413ee9">Rebels assert control in Syria</h2><p>The rebels who ended the Assad family’s regime in Syria <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/09/world/syria-assad-rebels" title="">began asserting control today</a> over the capital, Damascus.

You could walk right past and never guess that on the other side of the door is one of the world’s most influential sushi chefs, Keiji Nakazawa.</p><p>The restaurant opened to very little fanfare in March. But the more dishes you taste, the clearer it becomes that Nakazawa is extraordinarily accomplished in his craft, particularly a style of sushi called Edomae, which he helped revive.
