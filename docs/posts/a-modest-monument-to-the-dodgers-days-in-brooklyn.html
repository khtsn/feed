In 1962, the Ebbets Field Apartments rose up in its place.</p><p>Now, with the Yankees and the Dodgers competing in the World Series, the plaque that gets a small handful of visitors most days is now seeing a few groups almost every hour.</p><p>And Mr. Askotzky and his staff of 40 or so maintenance workers and porters have become unwitting, and generally ungrudging, caretakers of this almost-hidden vestige of the franchise’s lore.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Monday, hours before Game 3 of the World Series in the Bronx, Phillip Duke, a maintenance staffer who has worked at the complex for more than 20 years, was crouched on the sidewalk, using a cordless drill with a brush bit to burnish the plaque.</p><p>At one point, Adam Aguilar and Osvaldo Heredia, two friends visiting the city from San Bernardino, Calif., wandered hesitantly into the parking lot.</p><p>“We’re looking for the home plate marker,” Mr. Heredia said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ezra Askotzky, the maintenance manager, said he found wooden baseball bats left behind in a vacant apartment and now offers them to visitors as props for photos.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jonah Markowitz for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Oh, we sold it this morning,” one of the porters said, with a straight face. “For $1.5 million. It’s gone.”</p><p>The friends looked at each other, surprised and dejected. A second later, the workers burst out laughing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“No,” the porter said. “You’re standing on it.”</p><p>Indeed, one of the memorial’s defining features is its inconspicuousness. You wouldn’t see it if you weren’t looking. And even if you were, you might struggle to find it.</p><p>Paul Dagliolo, a Dodgers fan, walked to the wrong parking lot on Monday after deciding on a whim to find the plaque. His grandparents were fans of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and he considers himself something of a dying breed: a native New Yorker who roots for the team.</p><p>Mr. Dagliolo, 37, of Astoria, bent over to touch the plate — “trying to get the old Brooklyn ghosts going” — and left shortly after, feeling at once impressed and a tad underwhelmed.</p><p>“There should be more of a shrine to it,” he said. “It’s part of the fabric of Brooklyn. If I had to give feedback, I would say they could do a little more with it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A mural in the neighborhood shows Ebbets Field in its heyday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jonah Markowitz for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>But the memorial, of course, is not sequestered inside a museum. It sits on the well-trodden pavement of a sprawling, 1,318-unit apartment complex.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>As on any New York City sidewalk, most of the residents on Monday wove wordlessly around the loitering tourists and visitors, hardly breaking stride.</p><p>One resident, Alexia Scott, 39, who grew up in the houses and recently moved back, took the time to shepherd over a couple of confused out-of-towners she had encountered down the street.</p><p>Ms. Scott said she was proud of the building’s past — its associations with Jackie Robinson and Black history — but noted that gentrification and changing immigration patterns in the neighborhood meant that fewer people seemed to revel in its aura.</p><p>“New people don’t always understand the gravity of the fact that we’re walking where legends walked,” Ms. Scott said. “This is a landmark, and we really need to preserve this space.” She paused, saying she had gotten chills. “It’s a big deal. But it looks like this.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>More than 60 years after the Dodgers left Brooklyn, vestiges of their presence in the borough have dwindled.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jonah Markowitz for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Askotzky said he often met people who had attended Brooklyn Dodgers games as children. He said he had found the wooden bats in a vacant apartment one day and brought them downstairs, thinking they might be of use.</p><p>“Some people really crouch down into a stance,” Mr. Askotzky said. (He prefers basketball and football to baseball: “The games are too long. It’s too slow.”)</p><p>As the day went on, more visitors arrived, sparking more banter with the staff — about whether the Yankee Stadium crowd could buoy the home team that night, whether certain star players were healthy or not, and who ultimately would take the trophy.</p><p>When the chatter died down, Mr. Aguilar, the fan from California, seemed suddenly struck by the emotional weight of his surroundings.</p><p>“Damn,” he said, straightening his back. “Jackie Robinson used to stand right here.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Oct. 29, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misidentified the date listed on a plaque commemorating Ebbets Field and the first Major League Baseball game played by Jackie Robinson.
