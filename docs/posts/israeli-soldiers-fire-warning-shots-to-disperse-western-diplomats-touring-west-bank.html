The gunfire came two days after Britain, France and Canada <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/world/middleeast/israel-allies-denounce-gaza-offensive.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">called for Israel to end the war in Gaza</a>, and a day after Britain <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/israel-and-the-occupied-palestinian-territories-foreign-secretary-statement-20-may-2025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications-topic&amp;utm_source=e0d6d5b6-a66b-4b7d-bf7c-dce34d2df5d9&amp;utm_content=immediately" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suspended trade talks</a> with Israel and criticized its support for settlements in the West Bank.</p><p>Diplomats from all three countries were among a large diplomatic delegation on Wednesday that toured the city of Jenin in the West Bank, with officials from the Palestinian Authority, the semiautonomous institution that administers parts of the territory, including Jenin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The authority had organized the tour to highlight how the Israeli military, seeking to stamp out armed groups, had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/world/middleeast/israel-west-bank-palestinians-fear-annexation.html" title="">captured and partly demolished</a> an area on the edge of the city. The neighborhood is known as the Jenin refugee camp because it mostly houses the descendants of Palestinians forced to flee their homes during the wars surrounding the creation of the state of Israel.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Toward the end of the tour, Israeli soldiers in the neighborhood fired at least seven shots to disperse some of the visiting officials as they stood about 80 yards from the soldiers, on the other side of a closed gate, according to several videos verified by The New York Times. The footage showed that the shooting began as officials milled around conducting interviews with journalists, several of them with their backs turned to the soldiers.</p><p>After the gunshots rang out, the delegation quickly retreated from the barrier and some members took cover on a side street.</p><p>The gunfire occurred a few hundred yards from where an Israeli soldier <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/world/middleeast/israel-soldier-shireen-abu-akleh-palestinian-american-journalist-shooting.html" title="">fired on a prominent Palestinian journalist</a>, Shireen Abu Akleh, killing her, in May 2022.</p><p>In a statement, the Israeli military said that its troops had fired warning shots at the delegation on Wednesday because it had “deviated from the approved route and entered an area where they were not authorized to be.” The military said it “regrets the inconvenience caused,” adding that it was reviewing what happened.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mohammad Jarrar, the mayor of Jenin, contested the military’s claim, saying that Palestinian officials had agreed on the route that they took with Israeli counterparts earlier in the week. “There was no provocation,” Mr. Jarrar said. “Only diplomats and journalists were there, and the visit plan was attached to the official invitation.”</p><p>The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said the Israeli military’s conduct was unacceptable and that he would summon the Israeli ambassador to France to explain what happened.</p><p>Canada’s foreign minister, Anita Anand, wrote on X that she was relieved to know the Canadians in the delegation were safe and said she had “asked my officials to summon Israel’s Ambassador to convey Canada’s serious concerns. We expect a full investigation and accountability.”</p><p>The European Union’s top diplomat, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/world/europe/eu-syria-sanctions.html" title="">Kaja Kallas</a>, called on Israel to hold the shooters accountable. “Any threats on diplomats’ lives are unacceptable,” Ms. Kallas <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1233235581785369" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> at a news briefing.</p><p>Representatives of the European Union were among at least 20 diplomatic missions on the tour.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Patrick Kingsley<!-- -->, <!-- -->Aurelien Breeden<!-- -->, <!-- -->Sanjana Varghese<!-- --> and <!-- -->Malachy Browne<!-- -->.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>5</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Israeli Soldiers Fire in Air to Disperse Western Diplomats in West Bank<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Anniversary of the Vietnam War: </strong>Photography from Vietnam changed how the world saw the war, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/vietnam-war-photography-impact.html">how Americans saw their own country</a> and the war itself, which ended 50 years ago.
