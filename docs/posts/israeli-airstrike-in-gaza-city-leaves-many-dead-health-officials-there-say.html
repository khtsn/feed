The Israeli military says Hamas operatives embed among civilians. On Wednesday, it said that it had taken “numerous steps” to reduce harm to civilians before striking, using aerial surveillance, “other intelligence” and precise weaponry.</p><p>A New York Times investigation has found that the Israeli military has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-bombing.html" title="">loosened its rules</a> on how many civilians it can endanger with each airstrike, and international law experts note that Israel has an obligation to protect civilians.</p><p>Dozens of wounded survivors on Wednesday were sent to Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, where Khamis Elessi, a volunteer doctor, said bloodied children were crowded into the emergency room.</p><p>“It makes you want to cry,” Mr. Elessi, 56, said in a phone interview. “When I see these kids, I imagine what if they were mine. I don’t care if two parties are fighting each other, but the kids have nothing to do with it.”</p><p>Many in the emergency room were being treated on the floor because the hospital had no free beds, he said. Gaza’s health care system is struggling to cope with casualties, particularly after Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-block.html" title="">blocked all humanitarian aid</a> from entering Gaza on March 2, including medical supplies and fuel.</p><p>The sounds of crying and screaming filled the hospital’s morgue, where the dead were laid out. One man screamed as he gripped his son’s body. His relatives had to pull him away.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Victims of the strike on Wednesday.

A shaky cease-fire paused the fighting and allowed more humanitarian help to enter Gaza from January to March, but Israel renewed airstrikes after the two sides failed to reach an agreement to extend the truce.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Relatives with the bodies of family members killed after an Israeli airstrike in the Shajaiye neighborhood of Gaza City on Wednesday.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Adam Rasgon<!-- -->, <!-- -->Abu Bakr Bashir<!-- -->, <!-- -->Rawan Sheikh Ahmad<!-- --> and <!-- -->Aric Toler<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vivian Yee is a Times reporter covering North Africa and the broader Middle East.
