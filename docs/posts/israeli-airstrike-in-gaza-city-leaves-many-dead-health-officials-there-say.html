About 20 people remained missing, but rescuers had little equipment to pull them from the rubble, officials said.</p><p>The Israeli military said it had been targeting a Hamas operative who it said was responsible for planning attacks. It did not name the operative or give further details. Civil Defense’s death toll, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, could not be independently verified. Gaza’s Health Ministry had not yet released a death toll.</p><p>A Civil Defense spokesman, Mahmoud Basal, said the strike had destroyed eight homes in Shajaiye, an already hard-hit area. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/09int-gaza-strike-gpbv/09int-gaza-strike-gpbv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/09int-gaza-strike-gpbv/09int-gaza-strike-gpbv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/09int-gaza-strike-gpbv/09int-gaza-strike-gpbv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A heavily damaged urban area with a cloud of smoke and dust rising nearby." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/09int-gaza-strike-gpbv/09int-gaza-strike-gpbv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/09int-gaza-strike-gpbv/09int-gaza-strike-gpbv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/09int-gaza-strike-gpbv/09int-gaza-strike-gpbv-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/09int-gaza-strike-gpbv/09int-gaza-strike-gpbv-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/b3f92d30-90de-51dd-939b-e8bf1c2be14b" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The site of the airstrike in Shajaiye on Wednesday.

A donkey cart pulled another blanket-wrapped body away.</p><p>Hazem Rajab, 49, was sitting on his living room couch on Wednesday when he heard a sudden explosion. His son Yusuf, 12, was standing in front of him. The ceiling caved in, and Yusuf was gone, Mr. Rajab recalled in a phone interview.</p><p>Rescuers arrived about 15 minutes later to save Mr. Rajab, who was protected by a concrete pillar that had fallen over him, and two other children, he said. But Yusuf was killed.</p><p>It had been only about three months since Mr. Rajab’s wife, another son and three of their daughters were killed in “the greatest loss of our lives,” Mr. Rajab said.</p><p>Additional airstrikes hit elsewhere in the neighborhood on Wednesday, Mr. Basal said, but rescuers had not yet been able to respond to those strikes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At a burial of those killed in the strike on Wednesday. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Israel has faced international condemnation for airstrikes that have killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza. The Israeli military says Hamas operatives embed among civilians. On Wednesday, it said that it had taken “numerous steps” to reduce harm to civilians before striking, using aerial surveillance, “other intelligence” and precise weaponry.</p><p>A New York Times investigation has found that the Israeli military has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-bombing.html" title="">loosened its rules</a> on how many civilians it can endanger with each airstrike, and international law experts note that Israel has an obligation to protect civilians.</p><p>Dozens of wounded survivors on Wednesday were sent to Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, where Khamis Elessi, a volunteer doctor, said bloodied children were crowded into the emergency room.</p><p>“It makes you want to cry,” Mr. Elessi, 56, said in a phone interview. “When I see these kids, I imagine what if they were mine. I don’t care if two parties are fighting each other, but the kids have nothing do with it.”</p><p>Many in the emergency room were being treated on the floor because the hospital had no free beds, he said. Gaza’s health care system is struggling to cope with casualties, particularly after Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-block.html" title="">blocked all humanitarian aid</a> from entering Gaza on March 2, including medical supplies and fuel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Victims of the strike on Wednesday.

Neither figure distinguishes between combatants and civilians.</p><p>The Israeli military said on Friday that its forces had begun <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hamas-evacuation.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">operating in Shajaiye</a> to expand what the military has characterized as a buffer zone next to Israel’s border with Gaza.</p><p>The military had ordered people to leave parts of northern Gaza late last week as it stepped up its ground campaign. But while many complied, others chose to stay, saying that they could not face more upheaval after enduring <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-offensive-palestinians-displaced.html" title="">displacement after displacement</a> earlier in the war. Israel is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-offensive-hamas-war-katz.html" title="">holding an increasing amount of territory</a>, leaving Gazans even fewer places to go.</p><p>Alaa al-Sosi, 42, said she and her children would have to return to Shajaiye after fleeing the area on Wednesday. “We have no other place to stay,” she said.</p><p>During the first 15 months of war, the fighting between the Israeli military and Hamas reduced much of Shajaiye <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/21/world/middleeast/gaza-israel.html" title="">to a wasteland</a>.</p><p>A shaky cease-fire paused the fighting and allowed more humanitarian help to enter Gaza from January to March. But Israel broke the cease-fire on March 18 with renewed airstrikes after the two sides failed to reach an agreement to extend the truce.</p><p>Since then, the Israeli military has bombed Gaza repeatedly and seized more territory, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-attack-gaza-hamas.html" title="">a strategy</a> that Israeli officials say is intended to compel Hamas to release more hostages.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Relatives with the bodies of family members killed after an Israeli airstrike in the Shajaiye neighborhood of Gaza City on Wednesday.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Adam Rasgon<!-- --> contributed reporting from Jerusalem, <!-- -->Abu Bakr Bashir<!-- --> from London and <!-- -->Rawan Sheikh Ahmad<!-- --> from Haifa, Israel.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vivian Yee is a Times reporter covering North Africa and the broader Middle East.
