The revised document <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/us/politics/trump-indictment-election-jan-6.html" title="">stripped out some charges in order to help it survive the Supreme Court’s recent ruling</a> granting former presidents broad immunity for official acts in office.</p><p>The filing from Jack Smith, the special counsel, came just days before he and Trump’s lawyers were scheduled to provide the judge overseeing the case with proposals for how to assess the Supreme Court ruling. It is not yet clear how today’s charges will affect those proceedings.</p><p>In the new filing, Smith’s team removed all the allegations regarding Trump’s attempts to strong-arm the Justice Department into supporting his false claims that the election had been rigged against him. Those efforts could be considered official acts under the Supreme Court’s ruling.</p><p>But much of the old indictment, which was filed last year, remained untouched. Trump is accused of overlapping conspiracies to defraud the U.S., obstruct the certification of the election at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and deprive millions of Americans of their rights to have their votes counted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Donald Trump and Robert F.
