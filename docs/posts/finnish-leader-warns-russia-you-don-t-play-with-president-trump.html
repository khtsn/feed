Florida, President Trump said he was “pissed off” at the Kremlin and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-angry-putin-zelenskyy-iran-sanctions-rcna198729" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">threatened</a> to impose sanctions on Russia’s oil customers.</p><p>Hours after they sat next to each other at Pope Francis’ funeral in Vatican City, Mr. Trump lit into Moscow for shooting missiles at civilian areas in Ukraine. “Too many people are dying!!!” Mr. Trump wrote <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114404524335638236" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Truth Social</a> on Saturday, again threatening Russia with sanctions if the Kremlin strung him along.</p><p>It could be a coincidence. Or Mr. Trump could be listening to Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb, who has emerged as a prominent voice of Europe’s smaller nations on Russia’s war against Ukraine.</p><p>In an interview with The New York Times on Sunday, Mr. Stubb downplayed his effect on Mr. Trump. He noted that President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain were leading European efforts, with his role being merely to “nudge things in the right direction” and “try to connect the dots.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But Mr. Stubb’s country understands the peril of peace negotiations for Ukraine perhaps better than any other. After wars with the Soviet Union in the 1940s, Finland gave up land to Moscow, agreed to neutrality and accepted limits on its military, remaining under the Kremlin’s thumb to some degree for decades.</p><p>Mr. Stubb doesn’t want Ukraine to suffer the same fate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/28/multimedia/00finland-president-5-ctqh/00finland-president-5-ctqh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/28/multimedia/00finland-president-5-ctqh/00finland-president-5-ctqh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/28/multimedia/00finland-president-5-ctqh/00finland-president-5-ctqh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="President Trump and President Alexander Stubb of Finland sit a few feet apart, leaning toward each other to converse, with Mr. Stubb shielding his mouth with one hand." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/28/multimedia/00finland-president-5-ctqh/00finland-president-5-ctqh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/28/multimedia/00finland-president-5-ctqh/00finland-president-5-ctqh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/28/multimedia/00finland-president-5-ctqh/00finland-president-5-ctqh-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/28/multimedia/00finland-president-5-ctqh/00finland-president-5-ctqh-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/e7585a79-3bb2-5be7-a4a5-af41ad7cdcc6" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Stubb and President Trump during the Pope Francis’ funeral on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He declined to detail his conversations with the American president, though he said he left Vatican City feeling “a tad more optimistic” about the prospects for peace. But Mr. Trump, after their two recent meetings, has repeated almost verbatim the very message Mr. Stubb has been sending publicly: President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia will “play a cat-and-mouse game to the bitter end” and is stringing Washington along, requiring Mr. Trump to increase the pressure through “power and sanctions.”</p><p>“Everyone has to understand that the only thing that Putin understands is power,” Mr. Stubb said. “I mean, there’s a reason why Finland has one of the strongest militaries in Europe, and the reason is not Sweden.”</p><p>Russia shares an 835-mile border with Finland, and by Mr. Stubb’s count, has fought 30 wars or skirmishes against the Finns since the 1300s.

He is a 6-foot-2 marathoner and triathlete who speaks fluent English with only a slight accent, plays near-professional-level golf — he competed on the Finnish national team — and brings a central-casting look to his position. He spent a year of high school in Daytona Beach and graduated from Furman University in South Carolina.

He says he hopes his special understanding of the United States and Russia can be of assistance.</p><p>He said he sensed Mr. Trump’s exasperation.</p><p>“The president is running out of patience, and we’ve now seen statements which are quite tough on Putin and Russia,” Mr. Stubb said. “So I just hope the Kremlin understands that you don’t play with President Trump.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>He said Mr. Trump’s diminished patience could “actually then move things in the right direction” by forcing Russia to stop delaying.</p><p>But Mr. Trump has been known to abruptly change his public stances, often aligning them with people he has recently consulted. And despite his warnings to the Kremlin, he hasn’t followed through with any increased pressure on Mr. Putin, instead aiming much of his ire at Mr. Zelensky.</p><p>Mr. Putin declared a unilateral 72-hour cease-fire on Monday in what seemed to be a response to Mr. Trump’s outburst.

A leaked draft of the original U.S. proposal published by Reuters suggested that the guarantors would be primarily European, and made no mention of U.S. involvement.</p><p>Mr. Stubb’s approach is a departure from that of his predecessor, Sauli Niinisto, sometimes called a “Putin whisperer.”</p><p>Mr. Niinisto played ice hockey with the Russian president and cast himself as a mediator, hosting Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump for their first summit in Helsinki in 2018. Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 made that approach untenable among Finns, who broadly sympathized with Ukraine’s plight, and their nation joined NATO in 2023 in response.</p><p>“Times, they are a-changing,” Mr. Stubb said.</p><p>The Finnish leader has shown dexterity in his dealings with Mr. Trump.</p><p>He offered to supply the United States with icebreakers, which Finland produces and Washington needs to compete in the Arctic.
