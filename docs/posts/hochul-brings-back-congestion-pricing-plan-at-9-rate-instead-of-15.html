    <h1>Hochul Brings Back Congestion Pricing Plan at $9 Rate Instead of $15</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The election of Mr. Trump appeared to spur the governor’s sudden move to revive congestion pricing. Ms. Hochul has also faced legal challenges to her decision to halt the plan, as well as intensifying criticism from transportation advocates.</p><p>New York officials would still need to seek final federal approval for the program to get underway. They have been working closely with the Biden administration on that approval.</p><p>A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation said on Thursday that New York officials had notified the department of the updated plan with a toll of $9. The <a href="https://highways.dot.gov/about/about-fhwa" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Highway Administration</a>, an agency within that department, “is working expeditiously to finalize the needed steps to complete the agreement,” he added.</p><p>If the program does not receive final federal approval before Mr. Trump is inaugurated, he could block it permanently.</p><p>Supporters of the plan, some of whom have fought for decades to institute congestion pricing, applauded Ms. Hochul’s decision and urged her to move quickly to get the program up and running before the inauguration.</p><p>At the same time, critics prepared to resume their legal efforts to block the plan. A total of nine lawsuits over congestion pricing have been filed by opponents in recent years.</p><p>Emma Fitzsimmons<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div>
