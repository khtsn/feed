The $9 toll was expected to stay in place for at least three years, officials said, before possibly being raised. The January start date would allow for a 30-day public review period for the revised plan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gov.

Officials at the M.T.A. had already spent more than half a billion dollars and installed much of the equipment needed to put the program in place when it was halted.</p><p>The governor said on Thursday that her decision to revive the tolls was not motivated by Donald J. Trump’s forthcoming return to the presidency in January. Mr. Trump has vowed to kill congestion pricing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I’m not driven by the calendar of when people are elected or not elected,” she said during the news conference.</p><p>Ms. Hochul has also faced legal challenges to her decision to halt the plan, as well as intensifying criticism from transportation advocates.</p><p>New York officials would still need to seek final federal approval for the program to get underway. They have been working closely with the Biden administration on that approval.</p><p>A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation said on Thursday that New York officials had notified the department of the updated plan with a toll of $9. The <a href="https://highways.dot.gov/about/about-fhwa" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Highway Administration</a>, an agency within that department, “is working expeditiously to finalize the needed steps to complete the agreement,” he added.</p><p>If the program does not receive final federal approval before Mr. Trump is inaugurated, he could block it permanently.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Supporters of the plan, some of whom have fought for decades to institute congestion pricing, applauded Ms. Hochul’s decision and urged her to move quickly to get the program up and running before the inauguration.</p><p>At the same time, critics prepared to resume their legal efforts to block the plan. A total of nine lawsuits over congestion pricing have been filed by opponents in recent years.</p><p>Emma Fitzsimmons<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ana Ley is a Times reporter covering New York City’s mass transit system and the millions of passengers who use it.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ana-ley">More about Ana Ley</a></span></p></div><div><p>Winnie Hu is a Times reporter covering the people and neighborhoods of New York City.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/winnie-hu">More about Winnie Hu</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/kathy-hochul">Kathy Hochul</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/11/14/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc-hochul.html">142</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Politics in the New York Region</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Congestion Pricing:</strong> Gov.
