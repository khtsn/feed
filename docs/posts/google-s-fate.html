    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><div id="top-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-top">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p><div></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Google, a judge ruled earlier this month, is a monopolist. Now comes the hard part: How can its search be fixed to restore competition? Next week, the judge will hold his first hearing to consider the answer.</p><p>This one could be messy. There’s a long menu of options that Amit Mehta of the Federal District Court in D.C. could choose from. He could restrict Google’s deals with companies like Apple. He could form separate companies for products like Google’s Chrome browser and its Android operating system. Or he could come up with a completely new idea. And however he tries to curb Google’s power could set a precedent for the rest of the tech industry, as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/technology/google-microsoft-antitrust-cases.html" title="">antitrust suit against Microsoft did two decades ago</a>.</p><p>The timing is tricky, too. Search is changing as corporations unveil artificial intelligence to answer more queries. In the end, Google says it will appeal anyway, which will set off another round of hearings.</p><p>In today’s newsletter, we’ll explain the options that the judge has for punishing Google, and the potential benefits and drawbacks of each.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p><h2 id="link-5f9fbe11">What harmed competition?</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A demonstration of new Google search features.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amy Osborne/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The government isn’t likely to show up with concrete proposals at the first hearing on remedies, as this process is called, next Friday. It’s too early for that. Instead, the proceeding is a chance for Mehta to describe what he’s looking for.</p><p>The Justice Department wants <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/technology/google-monopoly-antitrust-justice-department.html#:~:text=U.S.%20Said%20to%20Consider%20a,a%20breakup%20of%20the%20company.&amp;text=David%20McCabe%20reported%20from%20Washington%20and%20Nico%20Grant%20from%20San%20Francisco." title="">to break Google up</a>. But there are several less drastic ideas floating around, depending on which behaviors Mehta wants to curtail. His ruling could be a guide to these possible remedies, some of which he could impose in combination. Mehta called out a few things that, he said, ran afoul of the law.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Business deals that prioritize Google’s search engine on smartphones. </strong>Google paid Apple and other partners about $20 billion per year to ensure its search was the default: When an iPhone user searches for something in Apple’s browser, Google provides the results. Mehta said this helped the company illegally maintain its dominance. The judge could forbid such deals. That might be good for rivals like Microsoft, which owns the search engine Bing, or DuckDuckGo. But the judge can’t stop Apple from using Google as the default if it wants to.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Forcing Google’s search on users of its own operating system. </strong>The company introduced a screen letting Android users pick a search engine after a 2020 antitrust ruling in Europe. Google could be forced to do something similar in the United States.</p></li><li><p><strong>Google’s </strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/18/business/google-antitrust-trial-data.html" title="">huge trove of data</a></strong><strong>. </strong>The company has a massive advantage: Its quarter century of data about searches means that it knows far better than its competitors what people are looking for online. That data makes Google’s searches better — and keeps users loyal, cementing the company’s dominance. Some antitrust activists say Mehta should force the tech giant to share that search-history data with rivals to help them catch up. But consumers might not be thrilled to learn that their search histories have been shipped to another tech conglomerate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Google controls 90 percent of search. </strong>The judge could force Google, valued at $2 trillion, to sell the Chrome browser or the Android operating system. He could stop the company from installing its search as the default option on the software, too.</p></li></ul><h2 id="link-46f200b2">Seeking fairness</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Google building in Manhattan</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">John Taggart for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mehta isn’t just looking at Google. He’ll also consider how his orders could affect other companies, restore competition or even distort markets in new ways. For instance, if he makes Google sell Android, what happens if the software ends up in the hands of another Big Tech player like Microsoft or Meta? He’ll have to weigh how his decisions will affect the future of technology.</p><p>And he’ll want to do so in a way that doesn’t freak customers out. How will people accustomed to Google feel if it’s harder to find their search engine — or if they have to pay to use it?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>My sources tell me it could take as little as three months or more than a year to know what will happen, given that Google will appeal. In 2000, a decision to break up Microsoft was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/technology/google-microsoft-antitrust-cases.html" title="">reversed</a> the following year. The lawsuits this time could continue until the late 2020s.</p><p>Google, meanwhile, will start a whole new antitrust defense next month in another case brought by the Justice Department. This one is about something completely different — its alleged monopolization of the online ad market.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> Google’s antitrust case has opened the door to other lawsuits. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/technology/google-yelp-lawsuit.html" title="">Yelp sued Google yesterday</a>, claiming that Google unfairly tilted search to favor its own local listings over Yelp’s.</p><h2 id="link-2e75c657">More on tech</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pavel Durov</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><ul><li><p>The founder of Telegram, a messaging platform with minimal content moderation, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/business/telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-charged.html" title="">was charged</a> in France with crimes related to illicit activity on the app.</p></li><li><p>Chinese entrepreneurs and venture capitalists are moving to Silicon Valley for better business opportunities. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/business/china-venture-capital.html" title="">Some are struggling</a>.</p></li><li><p>U.S. and Chinese officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/world/asia/us-china-biden-xi.html" title="">discussed technology export controls</a> and Taiwan in talks in Beijing.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-58ab3c5b">International</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In the West Bank. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nasser Nasser/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><ul><li><p>Israel’s military said it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/29/world/israel-hamas-gaza-war" title="">killed five militants in a gun battle in a mosque</a> in the occupied West Bank, as a large military operation there continued.</p></li><li><p>Two journalists in Hong Kong <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/world/asia/hong-kong-stand-news-verdict.html" title="">were convicted of sedition</a>.
