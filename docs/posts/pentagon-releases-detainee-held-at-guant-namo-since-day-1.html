As the prison enters its 24th year in January, its mission has become more focused on discrete military trials than the prisoner-of-war-style operation that held and interrogated hundreds of wartime detainees in the early years.</p><p>Mr. Yazidi was the last of a dozen Tunisians once held at the prison, most of whom were captured in Afghanistan or Pakistan after the Sept. 11 attacks and brought to Guantánamo Bay as terrorism suspects.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
