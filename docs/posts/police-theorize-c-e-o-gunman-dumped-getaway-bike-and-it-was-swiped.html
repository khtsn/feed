Cameras captured the man entering the depot on West 178th Street at about 7:30 a.m., but not leaving.</p><p>After fleeing Midtown on the bike in the early morning, the gunman hailed a cab at 86th Street and Amsterdam Avenue and traveled to the bus station, paying the fare in cash.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But surveillance camera footage reviewed more recently by investigators showed him leaving the bus depot by subway. He took the A train downtown to Pennsylvania Station, Mr. Nieves said.</p><p>Though many trains leave the station and head west each day, the police are still trying to figure out exactly how the suspect got to Pennsylvania, where he was ultimately captured after nearly a week, Mr. Nieves said.</p><p>The footage of the suspect, whom the police have identified as Luigi Mangione, 26, gave investigators more information as they try to retrace his movement from New York to the McDonald’s in Altoona, Pa., where he was found on Monday.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/PAStatePolice/status/1866485855113630081" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Mangione was eating a hash brown</a> and looking at his laptop, when a fellow customer remarked to a friend that he resembled the person seen in photos the police had released of the gunman. An employee at the restaurant overheard the customer and called 911 to alert the police, who found Mr. Mangione with a handgun, ammunition and fake identification cards.</p><p>The authorities also found a 262-word handwritten manifesto with him, in which he appears to take responsibility for the murder.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Mangione, whose family had reported him missing in November <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/luigi-mangione-gunman-united-healthcare-shooting.html" title="">after several months passed without hearing from him</a>, is fighting extradition to New York, where prosecutors have charged him with second-degree murder.</p><p>Mr. Mangione is next due in court on Dec. 23, in Hollidaysburg, Pa., where a preliminary hearing will be held regarding the crimes he was charged with in that state. They include carrying a gun without a license and forgery.</p><p>Mr. Mangione’s lawyer on Thursday filed a petition arguing that Pennsylvania prosecutors have not shown that Mr. Mangione was in New York at the time of the murder. He also argued that prosecutors had not shown that there was probable cause that he committed the crime.</p><p>The lawyer, Thomas M. Dickey, asked the judge to stop extradition and to set bail for his client. A hearing on those matters is scheduled for Dec. 30.</p><p>Mr. Mangione’s family has not spoken with New York police, Mr. Nieves said.</p><p>As for the bicycle, the police are still hoping to find it, he said.</p><p>“Bikes don’t last very long on the streets around here,” Mr. Nieves said. “Someone sees it. They take it and that’s it.”</p><p>Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maria Cramer is a Times reporter covering the New York Police Department and crime in the city and surrounding areas.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
