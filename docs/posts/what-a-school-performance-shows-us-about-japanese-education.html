For me, the key lies in what we are taught during our elementary school years.</p><p>Children as young as six are given the responsibility to clean their own classrooms and serve one another lunch. Schools are structured like mini societies, where everyone has a role and is expected to contribute to the community. There’s a strong focus on nonacademic education intended to teach teamwork, work ethic and a sense of accomplishment.</p><p>Growing up in Japan as the child of a Japanese mother and a British father, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/opinion/theres-not-just-one-way-to-be-japanese.html" title="">I struggled with my identity</a>. It was only years later when I was living abroad that I came to appreciate the values and work ethic instilled in me by my elementary school education; they are so normalized in Japan that their worth is underappreciated. These traits also contribute to why Japanese society works the way it does: Our trains run on time because we are taught to prioritize harmony and consideration for others; on the other hand, we live under a collective pressure to conform and not bring shame upon our community.</p><p>In the short documentary above, “Instruments of a Beating Heart,” filmed in 2022, first graders at a Tokyo public school are presented with a challenge for their final semester: to form an orchestra and perform at a school ceremony. As the children are taught to “make your hearts as one” and rigorously rehearse, we see both the pressures and the wonders of being held responsible to a group. The character-building traditions in Japanese education are experienced through Ayame, who, in the face of newfound challenges, learns to be resilient. I believe the experience of overcoming obstacles, as Ayame does, is crucial to education. But where should the balance lie between discipline and freedom?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>What is happening in our schools will shape what our future society will look like. While the Japanese system has its strengths and weaknesses, I hope this film provides the opportunity for other societies around the world to hold a mirror to their educational systems and to reflect on how they want to raise the next generation.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
