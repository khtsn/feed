He is sitting for countless interviews after former Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign limited his media exposure. And as his party engages in collective finger-pointing, he is among the few Democrats admitting that they themselves made mistakes.</p><p>“I know my job and I didn’t get it done,” Mr. Walz, the governor of Minnesota, said last week on a podcast hosted by former Senator Jon Tester, the Montana Democrat.</p><p>The Tim Walz atonement-and-explanation tour had its biggest audiences to date on Saturday, when he delivered speeches to Democratic Party conventions in South Carolina and California.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“This dude’s the last guy I want to tell us about ‘we lost our way.’ You’re the guy who lost,” Mr. Walz said to the crowd in Columbia, S.C., on Saturday morning, imagining what listeners might be thinking. But, he added, “none of us can afford to shy away right now from asking the hard questions and doing the things we need to do to fix it so that we win elections.”</p><p>His approach stands in stark contrast with how his running mate has dealt with their loss. Ms. Harris gave a paid speech in Australia, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/style/kamala-harris-met-gala-2025.html" title="">appeared at the Met Gala in New York</a> (though she skipped the red carpet) and spoke <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/kamala-harris-trump-speech.html" title="">for barely more than 15 minutes to a political group in San Francisco</a>. Even as she weighs a run for governor of California, it was Mr. Walz who was the main attraction at that state’s Democratic convention.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Walz with Senators Amy Klobuchar, left, and Tina Smith, both Minnesota Democrats, near Brimson, Minn., in May.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Guttenfelder/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>While in California, Mr. Walz also took a clear shot at the state’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, who in March said i<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/gavin-newsom-transgender-sports-democrats.html" title="">t was “deeply unfair” that transgender athletes</a> were allowed to compete with girls.</p><p>“I’m just going to say it,” Mr. Walz said. “Shame on any of us who throws a trans child under the bus.” (Mr. Newsom did not attend the convention.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Since March, Mr. Walz has held town hall events in Republican congressional districts in Iowa, Nebraska and Ohio. He appeared at a rally for a judicial candidate in Wisconsin and spoke at a Montana Democratic Party fund-raising dinner. In addition to Mr. Tester’s podcast, he joined the “Twigg and Jenkins” show, Vox’s “Today, Explained” and podcasts hosted by Mr. Newsom and The New Yorker.</p><p>“If you don’t do an interview, you really are reducing the risk that you’ll say something stupid, but you’re also ceding the field,” Mr. Walz said in an interview on Friday. “I mean, I would have thought at some time you could overexpose, but Jesus, with Trump, it’s not possible.”</p><p>Both South Carolina and California are critical for anyone thinking about the 2028 presidential primary, not that Mr. Walz admits to doing much of that. He and his aides insist there is no grand strategy to his appearances, beyond keeping open as many options as possible. He is planning as if he will run for a third term as governor next year, and said he would make a formal decision by July.</p><p>Steve Bullock, the former Montana governor who invited Mr. Walz to his state party’s dinner in March, said Mr. Walz saw a moment “where we’ve got to have voices out there, and his is one that’s really relevant and really important.”</p><p>Mr. Bullock added, “I know he has a lot more freedom than he did last fall.”</p><p>Mr. Walz is certainly testing the boundaries of that freedom. He has not criticized Ms. Harris or former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. by name, but it is easy to sense his frustration with them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Like so many others, he laments the abbreviated nature of the Harris campaign. And after pledging to do whatever Ms. Harris wanted as her running mate, Mr. Walz found life as the vice-presidential nominee suffocating. A man who was chosen for his skills in television interviews was not allowed to do many of them because it would have highlighted Ms. Harris’s avoidance of reporters.</p><p>“If you think you’re just going to do a ‘60 Minutes’ interview and that’s going to get across, boy, that’s not it,” Mr. Walz said on Mr. Tester’s podcast, a reference to one of Ms. Harris’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/kamala-harris-60-minutes-interview-takeaways.html" title="">rare campaign trail interviews</a>.</p><p>For all the rending of garments over the 2024 results, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/31/us/politics/wes-moore-tim-walz-south-carolina-democrats.html" title="">Mr. Walz’s trip to South Carolina</a> also represented something else: his first real post-election effort to speak to Black voters, the most critical constituency for any Democrat with presidential aspirations. Each of the party’s last three contested primaries was won by the candidate — Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Mr. Biden — who consolidated Black support across Southern primary states.</p><p>Mr. Walz has had limited exposure to Southern Black Democrats, and his post-election analysis has dealt little with the drop-off in support from Black and Latino Democrats, focusing more on the ground the party lost with working-class voters more broadly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“I don’t think that Governor Walz hurt himself, mainly because the campaign hid him,” said former State Representative Bakari T. Sellers, a prominent South Carolina Democrat, in an interview a few days before the state convention. “He doesn’t really have a résumé that individuals are aware of here in South Carolina.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>South Carolina Democrats applauding Mr. Walz on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sean Rayford for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Walz’s appearance in the state this weekend seemed designed in part to change that. He introduced himself in earnest, meeting with top activists, speaking at fund-raisers and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/31/us/politics/wes-moore-tim-walz-south-carolina-democrats.html" title="">glad-handing at Representative James E. Clyburn’s annual fish fry</a>.</p><p>“Democrats, we have no shortage of good ideas,” Mr. Walz told South Carolina Democrats on Saturday. “But when we get into power, we haven’t been able to get the stuff done, at least not the stuff that people actually care about and feel in their lives.”</p><p>He also urged his party to push back vigorously against Mr. Trump: “Maybe it’s time for us to be a little meaner. Maybe it’s time for us to be a little more fierce.”</p><p>As for his plans for 2028, Mr. Walz compared his place in the eventual Democratic field to a member of an expedition trying to climb Mount Everest.</p><p>“No one knew who was going to the summit — it depended on who was ready on summit day,” Mr. Walz said in the interview. “You get the final camp, you push somebody up. What I’m saying is I want to be part of this team that gets there and pushes whoever it is up to the top.”</p><p>Laurel Rosenhall<!-- --> contributed reporting from Anaheim, Calif.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Reid J.
