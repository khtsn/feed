    <h1>How Global Warming Made Hurricane Milton More Intense and Destructive</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The second analysis, by researchers at Imperial College London, sought to estimate how much more economic loss a storm like Milton could cause compared with a similarly infrequent storm in an alternate version of today’s world, one with the same level of development and hurricane readiness, but without planet-warming emissions.</p><p>The researchers drew upon information from <a href="https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/21/393/2021/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previous</a> <a href="https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/817/2020/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">studies</a> of how the property damage from past hurricanes that hit the United States varied in response to where the storms came ashore and their maximum wind speeds.</p><p>High winds aren’t the only cause of destruction during a hurricane: Flooding, storm surge and tornadoes matter, too. But small-seeming jumps in a hurricane’s wind speeds can translate into big increases in damage, said Ralf Toumi, a climate scientist at Imperial College London who worked on the analysis.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/tc-potential" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, a hurricane’s potential damage in the United States rises by roughly a factor of four for every increase in the storm’s category rating. Milton made landfall this week as a Category 3 storm.</p><p>Think about it this way, Dr. Toumi said: In the chaos of a hurricane, the damage multiplies. The winds turn debris — or, say, the roof of your neighbor’s house — into flying projectiles.</p></div></div>
