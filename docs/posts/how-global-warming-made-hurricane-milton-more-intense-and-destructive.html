The first, by the World Weather Attribution research collaboration, relies on methods the group has used to estimate the influence of climate change on other extreme weather events, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/climate/hurricane-helene-climate-change.html" title="">Hurricane Helene last month</a>.</p><p>Warmer air can take up more moisture. So as humans heat the planet, storms like Milton can carry larger cargoes of rain. Warmer seawater also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/07/climate/gulf-mexico-ocean-temperature.html" title="">imbues hurricanes with more energy</a> as they traverse the ocean, allowing their winds to strengthen rapidly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The second analysis, by researchers at Imperial College London, sought to estimate how much more economic loss a storm like Milton could cause compared with a similarly infrequent storm in an alternate version of today’s world, one with the same level of development and hurricane readiness, but without planet-warming emissions.</p><p>The researchers drew upon information from <a href="https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/21/393/2021/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previous</a> <a href="https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/817/2020/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">studies</a> of how the property damage from past hurricanes that hit the United States varied in response to where the storms came ashore and their maximum wind speeds.</p><p>High winds aren’t the only cause of destruction during a hurricane: Flooding, storm surge and tornadoes matter, too. But small-seeming jumps in a hurricane’s wind speeds can translate into big increases in damage, said Ralf Toumi, a climate scientist at Imperial College London who worked on the analysis.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/tc-potential" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, a hurricane’s potential damage in the United States rises by roughly a factor of four for every increase in the storm’s category rating. Milton made landfall this week as a Category 3 storm.</p><p>Think about it this way, Dr. Toumi said: In the chaos of a hurricane, the damage multiplies. The winds turn debris — or, say, the roof of your neighbor’s house — into flying projectiles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“If that roof hits your roof, you’re in trouble,” Dr. Toumi said. “It’s just a cascading of problems.”</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
