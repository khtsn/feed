Although the city comes under drone attack almost nightly, ballistic missile launches targeting the city are less frequent.</p><p>The pre-dawn attack ruptured a water main near the city center, sending water cascading through the streets around the battered facade of the Lukianivska subway station. Nearby, smoke was rising from a charred van with at least two burned bodies inside.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As a blaze burned deep inside an industrial building across the street, some firefighters were trying to drag debris away from the front of a heavily damaged McDonald’s. Others concentrated on the huge chunks of glass, debris and insulation covering the sidewalk outside the subway station — typically a place where residents seek safety during attacks.</p><p>As investigators walked up and down the street, reaching into the rushing water to look for pieces of shrapnel, some shopkeepers tried to get through a police cordon.</p><p>“It’s very frightening, because this place keeps getting hit again and again,” said Yana, 30, who would give only her first name. “Some things are intercepted, but some always get through.”</p><p>When the waters subsided, a large crater was visible in the middle of the road as the sun rose. Yuriy Ihnat, an air force spokesman, <a href="https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/01/18/7494187/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the Ukrainska Pravda news outlet</a> that one of the missiles had been shot down at a low altitude, which would help explain the extensive damage to the street and surrounding buildings.</p><p>Ukraine’s air-defense teams had spent hours tracking and trying to shoot down attack drones in the skies above the country. Russia uses drones to hit targets and to exhaust air-defense teams and for months it has sent swarms of them into Ukraine nearly every night. Many are “dummy” drones, with no warheads, that are meant to overwhelm the mobile air-defense teams who are on watch 24 hours a day.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Kyiv tries to reserve its more sophisticated air-defense systems for contending with cruise and ballistic missiles, which are deadlier and more costly to produce.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The attack ruptured a water main near the center of Kyiv, sending water cascading through the streets.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Saturday, one air-raid alert had just ended in Kyiv shortly before 6 a.m. when booms were heard throughout the city. Seconds later, air-raid sirens began to wail. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that in addition to the four dead, three people had been wounded in the attack.</p><p>A separate strike in the city of Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine wounded at least 10 people, he added, warning that more people could still be trapped under the rubble there.</p><p>Zaporizhzhia has come under heavy attack in recent weeks, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/world/europe/ukraine-russia-oil-depot.html" title="">a strike this month</a> that killed 13 civilians and injured at least 110 others, according to Ukrainian officials. The United Nations estimated that there had been a 30 percent increase in civilian casualties in 2024 compared with a year earlier as Russia seeks to batter Ukraine into submission.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Saturday’s attack came a day after Russian missiles struck the city of Kryvyi Rih, in central Ukraine, killing four<strong> </strong>people<strong> </strong>and damaging buildings.</p><p>“Each such terrorist attack is another reminder of who we are dealing with,” Mr. Zelensky said after the strike on Kryvyi Rih, his hometown. “Russia will not stop on its own. It can only be stopped by joint pressure, the pressure of everyone in the world who values life.”</p><p>Ukraine has been building its arsenal of missiles and long-range drones to hit back at Russia, and in recent weeks has stepped up its campaign of targeting oil and gas facilities deep inside the country — an attempt to hobble Moscow’s war machine on its home territory.</p><p>That effort continued on Saturday, with fires reported at an oil depot in the Tula region, south of Moscow, and in the Kaluga region, about 100 miles southwest of Moscow.</p><p>The Russian Defense Ministry <a href="https://t.me/mod_russia/47996" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said that air defenses</a> had intercepted 46 Ukrainian drones overnight, including five over the Tula region and seven in the Kaluga region. It did not comment on any damage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Long aimed at limiting Moscow’s ability to strike Ukrainian cities, Kyiv’s attacks inside Russia have taken on added import in recent weeks.</p><p>Ukraine’s forces have been struggling on the battlefield at home, and the coming inauguration of Donald J. Trump in Washington has raised questions about whether the United States will maintain military support for Kyiv.</p><p>Mr. Trump, who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/us/trump-congress-ukraine-aid.html" title="">publicly expressed doubt</a> about continuing to assist Ukraine once he takes office on Monday, has said he will end the war swiftly, without specifying how.</p><p>Marc Santora<!-- --> and <!-- -->Liubov Sholudko<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
