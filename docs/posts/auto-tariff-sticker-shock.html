He also sees them as a revenue stream: The White House calculates that it <a href="https://apnews.com/article/autos-tariffs-trump-tax-imports-ford-gm-e53823ef7bbb7b3c46d11eca90aaa638" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">could raise $100 billion annually</a>. The tariff threat, however, has zapped more than that from the largest carmakers’ market capitalization in recent weeks.</p><p>Tariff gloom already snapped the S&amp;P 500’s three-day winning streak on Wednesday. And a reminder: Reciprocal tariffs are still set for April 2.</p><p><strong>Here’s the latest:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Shares in European automakers were down sharply on Thursday.

The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant.” (Like its rivals, it depends a lot on imported parts.)</p></li></ul><p><strong>Consumers appear set to face the brunt of tariffs.</strong> Automakers could see costs rise by $6,700 per vehicle sold, Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein, wrote in a research note on Thursday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The big question: How much of that will the companies absorb, and how much will they add to the sticker price? Either way, the levies are likely to dent their profits and force consumers to pay more.</p><p><strong>Households were already bracing for pain from Trump’s trade moves.</strong> The prospect of higher car prices comes as <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/consumer-confidence-lowest-level-12-years-recession-signs-what-to-know-rcna197996" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">consumer sentiment has plummeted</a>, reigniting concerns about an economic downturn.</p><p><strong>How will trade partners respond?</strong> Japan, which lobbied Trump hard with promises to invest big in the United States, called the tariffs “<a href="https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2025/03/5d5b549dc5ca-update1-japan-vows-appropriate-steps-against-us-auto-tariffs.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">extremely regrettable</a>.” It is petitioning for an exception, noting that its automakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/business/trump-tariffs-automakers-reaction.html" title="">are big employers in the United States</a>. South Korea has been quieter, though this week, Hyundai announced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/business/hyundai-us-investment-tariffs.html" title="">a $21 billion investment</a> in the country in a bid for tariff relief.</p><p><strong>Trump seems worried that others could fire back.</strong> In a Truth Social post, he <a href="https://trumpstruth.org/statuses/30387" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned Canada and the European Union</a> that if there was any joint retaliation, “large scale Tariffs, far larger than currently planned, will be placed on them both in order to protect the best friend that each of those two countries has ever had!”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div><h3 id="link-594cd70c"><span>HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING </span></h3><p><strong>The United States could run out of money by late May.</strong> The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/business/us-debt-limit.html" title="">new forecast from the Congressional Budget Office</a> puts more pressure on Congress to address the debt limit, though the nonpartisan agency said that if borrowing needs remain within projections, the so-called X-date could happen as late as September. A fight to avert a government shutdown could rock markets right as President Trump is planning to push through more tax cuts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>Trump pushes back against the Signal leak. </strong>Criticism of the administration grew on Wednesday after The Atlantic published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/25/us/signal-group-chat-text-annotations.html?campaign_id=57&amp;emc=edit_ne_20250326&amp;instance_id=151028&amp;nl=the-evening&amp;regi_id=162553394&amp;segment_id=194472&amp;user_id=5f1d3ba04b286f293f5a94afd0a7bd2a" title="">more messages</a> from the group chat, including specific details — like exact launch times — of U.S. airstrikes against Houthi targets <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/25/us/signal-group-chat-text-annotations.html" title="">disclosed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth</a>. But Trump played down concerns over the leak, calling them a “witch hunt.”</p><p><strong>Prosecutors are said to look into a claim about Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine.</strong> Officials at the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan have begun interviews over whether a former Pfizer scientist who joined GSK, a rival, told his new colleagues that Pfizer had <a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/pfizer-covid-vaccine-2020-election-probe-2f3ec247" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">delayed announcing the success</a> of its Covid shot until after the 2020 election, according to The Wall Street Journal. (GSK raised the matter with prosecutors, The Journal reported, while the scientist disputes that account.) The claim is politically volatile: Trump has long been angry about the timing of Pfizer’s news.</p><p><strong>A federal appeals court upholds an order barring federal funding freezes. </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/politics/appeals-court-funding-freezes.html" title="">The decision</a> leaves in place a lower court’s ruling blocking the Office of Management and Budget from choking off funds to states that Congress had appropriated, as state attorneys general push back against the Trump administration’s efforts to unilaterally cut spending. Separately, the administration asked the Supreme Court to let it cancel $65 million in teacher-training grants that it said would be used to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/politics/trump-supreme-court-teacher-grants.html" title="">promote diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives</a>.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-1d62c084">The stakes of an unwelcome visit</h2><p>As a U.S. delegation prepares to land in Greenland, President Trump is doubling down on his threats to acquire the territory. He <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-26/trump-says-us-must-have-greenland-as-vance-heads-over-on-trip" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told a conservative talk show host</a> on Wednesday that the mission of the trip — which now includes Vice President JD Vance — would be “to let them know that we need Greenland for international safety and security.”</p><p><strong>Trade routes are a focus. </strong>Most of Greenland is in the Arctic Circle, where melting ice is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/03/science/earth/arctic-shipping.html" title="">opening new shipping channels</a>. According to the U.S. Naval Institute, routes between Asia and Europe, or Asia and the United States, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-greenland-why.html" title="">up to 40 percent shorter</a> through the Arctic than through either the Suez or Panama Canals. Russia and China are already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-greenland-why.html" title="">cooperating on Arctic shipping routes</a>.</p><p><strong>Greenland also has lots of rare earth minerals</strong>, which are used in technology production and dominated by China, which has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/asia/china-minerals-semiconductors.html?searchResultPosition=12" title="">restricted the export of certain minerals</a> to the United States.</p><p>Trump has signaled keen interest in getting access to such resources: Last week he signed <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/20/trump-signs-order-to-increase-critical-mineral-production-in-the-us-.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an executive order</a> that aims to increase domestic critical mineral production, and Ukraine’s critical mineral stores have been a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/ukraine-mineral-deal-trump.html" title="">focus of Washington’s negotiations</a> with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.</p><p><strong>The visit may not help Trump</strong>. For one, the timing is bad. The territory is still in the process of forming a coalition government, after holding an election in which several candidates rebuffed the prospect of a U.S. takeover. Greenland’s prime minister called the trip “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/us/politics/usha-vance-trump-us-greenland.html" title="">highly aggressive</a>,” while activists planned to protest the arrival of the delegation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“This offensive pushes Greenland further away from the U.S., even though a year ago, all parties in Greenland were looking forward to more business with the Americans,” Lars Trier Mogensen, a political analyst based in Copenhagen, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/europe/trump-greenland-us.html" title="">told The Times</a>.</p><p><strong>The trip has since been scaled back.</strong> After the vice president was added to the delegation, which already included his wife, Usha Vance, and Mike Waltz, the national security adviser, the itinerary refocused on touring an American military base — nearly 1,000 miles north of the territory’s capital, Nuuk. (It’s unclear whether Waltz will still join.)</p><p><strong>But winning hearts and minds may not be the goal. </strong>Greenland’s recent election may present an opportunity for Trump: Two winning parties both favor independence from Denmark, which could <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/greenland-trump-election-vote-nuuk-demokraatit-naleraq-nielsen-rcna195977" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">open a door to partnership with Washington.</a> (That said, the overall winner has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/world/europe/greenland-election.html" title="">critical of Trump’s messaging</a>.)</p><p>Trump, however, has not veered from his goal of owning the island outright. “I think that we have to do it,” he told the talk show host, Vince Coglianese.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-443ce005">The Justice Department’s new task force </h2><p>As the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/business/trump-deregulation-firing.html" title="">rolls back regulations</a> across key government agencies, the Justice Department on Thursday is set to introduce a task force intended to turbocharge its red-tape-cutting efforts, DealBook is first to report.</p><p>The Anticompetitive Regulations Task Force, as it’s called, “will stand against harmful barriers to competition whether imposed by public regulators or private monopolists,” Gail Slater, assistant attorney general of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a statement.</p><p><strong>Its purpose is broadly defined.</strong> It aims to identify and curtail regulations that “undermine free market competition and harm consumers, workers and businesses,” according to the department. It will seek public input about which regulations are deemed too onerous across vast portions of the economy, including housing, food, energy and health care.</p><p><strong>It’s in response to Trump’s efforts to trim the bureaucratic state through executive orders. </strong>The first, in January, declared that federal agencies <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">should “alleviate unnecessary regulatory</a> burdens placed on the American people.”</p><p>The second, <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/25/2025-03138/ensuring-lawful-governance-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in February</a>, told agencies to identify regulations that imposed “significant costs upon private parties” or “undue burdens on small business and impede private enterprise and entrepreneurship.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><strong>It has echoes of Vice President JD Vance</strong>. Slater worked for him as an economic adviser. In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/world/europe/vance-speech-paris-ai-summit.html" title="">speech in Paris in February,</a> Vance made waves by detouring from the conference’s focus on artificial intelligence safety to warn of the risks he sees from an “overly precautionary regulatory regime.”</p><p><strong>What does this say about Slater’s approach to deals?</strong> Slater distinguishes between the administration’s approach to antitrust, which is <a href="https://www.davispolk.com/insights/client-update/trump-administration-signals-strong-approach-antitrust-enforcement" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tougher than many had anticipated</a>, and its approach to regulation, which remains heavily deregulatory.</p><p>“Antitrust enforcement is a scalpel,” Slater said <a href="https://x.com/senmikelee/status/1889736413291098492?s=61&amp;t=mvshv-2GAX9rupGX_CMqug" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in her confirmation hearing</a>, “and regulation is often a sledgehammer.”</p><hr/><h2 id="link-5118da9a">The other side of the gold rally </h2><p>Gold futures are trading at another record on Thursday — above $3,080 an ounce in New York — as jittery investors seek out a safer bet amid President Trump’s escalating trade war threats.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Market watchers think that the rally has only just begun, a surge that could factor into central bank policy decisions worldwide, a new Bank of America report details.</p><p><strong>Gold’s gains follow a big price upgrade.</strong> The metal is forecast to jump more than 10 percent over the next year, to $3,350 per ounce, Michael Widmer, a commodity strategist at Bank of America, wrote in a research note on Wednesday. The bank also offered a best-case scenario: gold eventually hitting $3,500 per ounce.</p><p><strong>Where could that demand come from?</strong> Widmer sees Chinese insurers — Beijing recently freed up the country’s insurance companies to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-10/china-frees-possible-27-billion-from-insurers-to-invest-in-gold?sref=0w5HLLb3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">invest 1 percent of their assets in gold</a> — and retail investors as two groups to watch. Gold-backed exchange traded funds <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/funds/investors-favor-gold-over-bitcoin-etfs-during-recent-market-volatility" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are booming</a>, far outperforming the S&amp;P 500 this year.</p><p><strong>There’s another potential whale in the gold trade.</strong> Central banks, Widmer said, “currently hold about 10 percent of their reserves in gold, and could raise this figure to +30 percent to make their portfolios more efficient.”</p><p>Non-U.S. central banks and governments tend to hold a lot of dollars in their reserves, underscoring the greenback as the world’s reserve currency, a standing that has been <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/06/11/dollar-dominance-in-the-international-reserve-system-an-update" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in decline in recent years</a>. As relations with the Trump administration grow icier, some countries are reportedly beginning to explore <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/some-european-officials-weigh-if-they-can-rely-fed-dollars-under-trump-2025-03-22/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a dollar-policy Plan B</a>, especially in the event of another financial crisis, Reuters reports.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p><strong>Such a geopolitical shift would play into the gold rally.</strong> “Uncertainty around Trump administration trade policies could continue to push the USD lower,” Widmer wrote, referring to the dollar, “further supporting gold prices near-term.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div><h3 id="link-7c091e00"><span>THE SPEED READ </span></h3><p><strong>Deals</strong></p><ul><li><p>OpenAI is reportedly close to wrapping up a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-26/openai-close-to-finalizing-its-40-billion-softbank-led-funding" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$40 billion funding round</a>, led by SoftBank and including Coatue Management, Founders Fund and Magnetar Capital.
