Wade.</p><p>But like a toothache they keep probing with their tongue, they just can’t seem to help it.</p><p>This week, it was Bernie Moreno, the Republican running to unseat Senator Sherrod Brown in Ohio, suggesting that abortion rights shouldn’t concern women over the age of 50 — “I don’t think that’s an issue for you,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3S0gGkHyY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said on tape</a> in Warren County, Ohio, over the weekend, as first reported by the NBC affiliate in Columbus.</p><p>On Monday, in Pennsylvania, former President Donald J. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/us/politics/trump-women-abortion.html" title="">simply declared that women won’t “be thinking about abortion”</a> once he’s elected.</p><p>And before his porn website revelations, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson of North Carolina, the Republican candidate running to be the state’s governor, was seen in a <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mark-robinson-young-women-sex-birth-control_n_66e87182e4b06998fbec7ceb" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">newly resurfaced video</a> from 2022 waving his hand in front of his groin, advising women seeking birth control that they just need to “get this under control.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Republicans have been eager to campaign on a southwestern border that at times has seemed uncontrolled, and on the lingering sting of inflation, both issues where voters continue to prefer Mr. Trump. But the one issue surveys have shown the party should be steering clear of is abortion. In the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/19/us/elections/times-siena-poll-toplines.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">most recent New York Times/Siena College poll</a>, 54 percent of registered voters trusted Vice President Kamala Harris on the issue, against 39 percent who trusted Mr. Trump.</p><p>And Democrats have fared well in virtually every election since 2022, when the Supreme Court repealed the constitutional protections enshrined in Roe v. Wade.</p><p>Yet in competitive contests, Republicans keep bringing it up, and in terms that their opponents have argued are disrespectful, if not contemptuous, of women. Even Nikki Haley, the former Republican governor of South Carolina who challenged Mr. Trump for the nomination, felt compelled to weigh in on Mr. Moreno’s comments, <a href="https://x.com/nikkihaley/status/1838568615601176582?s=46&amp;t=UcE2C5rY4rAA-HocyUn3Uw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posing the question on social media</a>, “Are you trying to lose the election? Asking for a friend.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bernie Moreno attracted criticism this week for suggesting that abortion rights, a thorny issue for Republicans, shouldn’t trouble women over 50.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Moreno, running in a state where Mr. Trump holds a clear lead but he has struggled, was caught on tape not only stoking the fire around abortion, but also perhaps rekindling the flame that Senator JD Vance of Ohio, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, had set alight with his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/26/us/politics/vance-megyn-kelly-harris-birthrate.html" title="">resurfaced “childless cat lady”</a> comments.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Sadly, there’s a lot of suburban women, a lot of suburban women that are like, listen, abortion is it,” Mr. Moreno said at a Warren County, Ohio, town hall. “If I can’t have an abortion in this country whenever I want, I will vote for anybody else.”</p><p>He went on, “it’s a little crazy, by the way, especially for women who are, like, past 50. I’m thinking to myself, ‘I don’t think that’s an issue for you.’”</p><p>Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/11/07/us/elections/results-ohio-issue-1-abortion-rights.html" title="">57 percent of Ohio voters</a> cast ballots to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution. Mr. Brown <a href="https://x.com/SherrodBrown/status/1838350072720834999" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quickly seized on his comments</a>, circulating the video on social media.</p><p>A Moreno campaign spokeswoman, Reagan McCarthy, said the comments were clearly “a tongue-in-cheek joke about how Sherrod Brown and members of the left-wing media like to pretend that the only issue that matters to women voters is abortion.”</p><p>“Bernie’s view is that women voters care just as much about the economy, rising prices, crime, and our open southern border as male voters do,” she continued, “and it’s disgusting that Democrats and their friends in the left-wing media constantly treat all women as if they’re automatically single-issue voters on abortion.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Brown shot back in a statement, “As a man over the age of 50, I care deeply about a woman’s right to make health care decisions for herself — for my daughters, my granddaughters, and all Ohio women, regardless of their age.”</p><p>Of course, nobody can touch Mr. Trump for digressions, especially those that carry him into politically fraught territory. Polls have shown a vast gender gap that favors Ms. Harris, and in his effort to woo back some women — including the “suburban women” mocked by Mr. Moreno who view abortion rights as a top issue — the former president has made a number of assertions <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/us/politics/trump-women-abortion.html" title="">about life under another Trump administration</a>.</p><p>On Monday, at a speech on economic policy, he showed he is still smarting from the backlash that has come since his nominees to the Supreme Court tipped the balance on the repeal of Roe v. Wade. He went into an extended riff on how women will no longer be fearful, sad, depressed and otherwise demoralized if he prevails in November.</p><p>He concluded, “Women will be happy, healthy, confident and free,” and “you will no longer be thinking about abortion.”</p><p>Asked what Mr. Trump meant by that, his campaign responded by reiterating his opposition to a “federal ban” on abortion and attacking Ms. Harris for supporting taxpayer-funded “abortion up until birth,” something she does not support.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Other comments from Republicans on top of abortion and reproductive rights have come in newly resurfaced videos. Mr. Robinson’s hand gesture dates back to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq7qyzjQPGU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">January 2022 when the lieutenant governor of North Carolina appeared at Hilltop Baptist Church</a> in Thomasville, N.C., to decry programs that teach sexual education and provide birth control. Instead, Mr. Robinson promoted abstinence until marriage.</p><p>“We love to tell our young women that we want to empower you,” he said, offering his own “novel idea” for getting female lives in check. “Why don’t you use some of that building up of your mind and building up of empowerment to move down here, to this region down here,” he said, waving his hand near his groin. “Get this under control.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mark Robinson was recorded in January 2022 waving his hand in front of his groin, advising women that they just need to “get this under control.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Travis Dove for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>To be sure, it has been difficult for Republican candidates to avoid the issue entirely, in part because legalizing abortion is on the ballot in several states, including Arizona and Nevada, both swing states, and Montana, which has a Senate election that could tip the balance of power in the chamber.</p><p>Sam Brown, a combat veteran grievously wounded in Afghanistan, would like his remarkable biography, not his past statements opposing abortion, to be the focus of his challenge to Senator Jacky Rosen, the Democratic incumbent in Nevada. But Mr. Brown was <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/brown-says-hes-not-for-changing-our-existing-law-on-abortion-ballot-measure" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">caught on a recording obtained by The Nevada Independent</a> late last month saying in private what he has been less than clear about in public — that he opposes the Nevada ballot measure to make abortion legal until fetal viability.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“I’m not for changing our existing law,” Mr. Brown said at a campaign event in Las Vegas. “Our existing law has been in place for over 34 years. The ballot measure would change the law and essentially have no limit on access to abortion.” (In fact, the measure would place limits after viability, around the 24th week of pregnancy.)</p><p>The Rosen campaign quickly ran <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8bnvlHwj64" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an attack ad framing</a> Mr. Brown as a “MAGA extremist trying to take away abortion rights.”</p><p>In response to Democratic efforts to capitalize, Mr. Brown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o4Tu7bDZpE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made a lengthy video</a> trying to explain his position because, he complained, “It’s the only issue Jacky Rosen wants to talk about.”</p><p>He stressed that Nevada voters could decide on the abortion laws of the state and promised never to “vote for a national abortion law.”</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Brown’s communications director, Raegan Lehman, added, “To no one’s surprise, the Democrats continue to lie about Sam’s common-sense position, because they refuse to talk about the abysmal failure that is Jacky Rosen’s record, that’s driven up costs on housing, groceries and energy for Nevada families.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Even when Republicans have tried to take Mr. Trump’s position that he will leave abortion decisions to the states, they have at least allowed Democrats to re-inject reproductive rights into the campaign conversation. Tim Sheehy, the businessman and military veteran with a strong shot of unseating Senator Jon Tester in Montana, was trying to take the Trump line late last month when he said he respected California’s right to have lenient abortion laws.</p><p>“If California says, you know, we’re going to fund abortions with California taxpayer dollars all day long, I think it’s terrible and disgusting, but if that’s what the California voters want to do with their state, OK,” <a href="https://heartlandsignal.com/2024/08/30/unearthed-audio-shows-tim-sheehy-calling-abortion-sinful-wanting-it-to-end-tomorrow/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said at a Republican women’s open house</a>.</p><p>Democrats latched onto the tone, not the policy, quoting over and over that he also said, “I find abortion to be a terrible, terrible thing. I want it all to end tomorrow.”</p><p>The Sheehy campaign did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jonathan Weisman is a politics writer, covering campaigns with an emphasis on economic and labor policy.
