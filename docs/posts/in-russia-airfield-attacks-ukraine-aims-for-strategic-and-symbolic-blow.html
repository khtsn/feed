One influential Russian military blogger, Rybar, run by Mikhail Zvinchuk, <a href="https://t.me/rybar/70941?single" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">put</a> the number of damaged Russian aircraft at 13, including up to 12 strategic bombers. Another one, Fighterbomber, believed to be run by Capt. Ilya Tumanov of the Russian Army, said in <a href="https://t.me/fighter_bomber/21294" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a post</a> on Monday that only “a handful” of strategic aircraft were hit, but even such a loss was “huge for a country that doesn’t make them.”</p><p>The Russian Ministry of Defense said that Ukraine attacked airfields in the Murmansk, Irkutsk, Ivanovo, Ryazan and Amur regions, and that it <a href="https://t.me/mod_russia/53366" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thwarted</a> attacks at three of the bases. The New York Times verified videos that showed successful strikes at Olenya Air Base in the Murmansk region and Belaya Air Base in the Irkutsk region and damage to at least five strategic aircraft.</p><p>The operation shows how Ukraine has been able to use drones to adapt and evolve in a war against a much larger army with more resources.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Videos verified by the Times indicate that Ukraine was able to pull off the attack, at least in part, by getting drones inside Russia.</p><p>One video shows a drone approaching Belaya air base before a strike. Other footage also shows two drones launched from containers mounted on the back of a semi-truck less than four miles away; they both fly in the direction of large smoke plumes now rising from the base. .</p><p>Another video shows drones flying less than four miles from the Olenya base. The man recording it suggests that the drones had been launched from a truck parked down the road. The Times could not confirm that these drones were part of the assault.</p><p>Even with limited information, military analysts said the operation ranks as a signature event on par with the sinking of the Russian flagship Moskva early in the war and the maritime drone assaults that forced the Russian Navy to largely abandon the home port of the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, Crimea.</p><p>“This is a stunning success for Ukraine’s special services,” said <a href="https://www.rusi.org/people/bronk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Justin Bronk</a>, senior research fellow for air power and technology at the Royal United Services Institute in London.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“If even half the total claim of 41 aircraft damaged/destroyed is confirmed, it will have a significant impact on the capacity of the Russian Long Range Aviation force to keep up its regular large scale cruise missile salvos against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, whilst also maintaining their nuclear deterrence and signaling patrols against NATO and Japan,” he said in an email.</p><p><a href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/people/experts/bio/mick-ryan" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mick Ryan</a>, a retired Australian general and fellow at the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based research group, said that “the proliferation of drones, open-source sensors and digital command and control systems means that long-range strike is now a commodity available to almost every nation state, and nonstate actor, with a few million dollars and the desire to reach out and strike their adversary.”</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, in comments on Monday at a NATO meeting of Baltic and Nordic countries, said the operation showed Russia that it is also subject to serious losses, and “that is what will push it toward diplomacy.”</p><p>However, Mr. Ryan and other analysts cautioned that despite the nature of the attacks, they are unlikely to alter the political calculus of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who remains bent on achieving his war aims.</p><p>Ivan Nechepurenko<!-- --> contributed reporting from Tblisi, Georgia and <!-- -->Steven Erlanger<!-- --> from Berlin.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Marc Santora has been reporting from Ukraine since the beginning of the war with Russia. He was previously based in London as an international news editor focused on breaking news events and earlier the bureau chief for East and Central Europe, based in Warsaw.
