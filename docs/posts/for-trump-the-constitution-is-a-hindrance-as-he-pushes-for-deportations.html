    <h1>For Trump, the Constitution Is a Hindrance as He Pushes for Deportations</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To expedite the process, Mr. Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century wartime law, to deport Venezuelans his administration has deemed to be part of a street gang. Last week, a federal judge permanently barred the Trump administration from invoking the law, which had been used only three times before in U.S. history.</p><p>Mr. Trump has also ignored <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-deported-migrant.html" title="">a Supreme Court ruling</a> that directs his administration to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a migrant the administration mistakenly sent to a prison for terrorists in El Salvador. Mr. Garcia remains in El Salvador, and some Democrats have argued that Mr. Trump has thrust the country into a constitutional crisis by ignoring the order.</p><p>The president has also lashed out at judges who have ruled against him, calling for their impeachment and in turn drawing further criticism from Democrats and legal critics, who say he is undermining the independence of the judiciary. His attacks even earned a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who said “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.”</p><p>But Mr. Trump has long had an adversarial relationship with the judicial system and feels further empowered to act after having faced dozens of criminal charges after leaving office in 2021. As a candidate, Mr. Trump teased that he would be a dictator on his first day in office (his aides said he was joking), and he has made clear he views the Justice Department as designed to defend his interests.</p><p>Now, Mr. Trump and his top aides show no signs of backing down from this fight.</p><p>“The right of ‘due process’ is to protect citizens from their government, not to protect foreign trespassers from removal,” Stephen Miller, one of Mr. Trump’s top advisers, posted Monday on social media. “Due process guarantees the rights of a criminal defendant facing prosecution, not an illegal alien facing deportation.”</p></div></div>
