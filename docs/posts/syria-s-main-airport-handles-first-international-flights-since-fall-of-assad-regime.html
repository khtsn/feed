Jordan’s Civil Aviation Authority announced that it had also sent an initial flight to Damascus on Tuesday morning as a “message of support” to its northern neighbor, the first trip there by its national carrier in 13 years.</p><p>Another flight affiliated with Syria’s national carrier took off on Tuesday for the United Arab Emirates carrying 145 passengers, according to Syrian state media. Video shared by Syrian media showed people on board waving Syrian flags and singing nationalist songs.</p><p>Syria’s new Islamist leaders have pledged to convene a committee to draft an inclusive constitution for the country. They have urged civil servants to return to work to get the machinery of government up and running, and they insist that Syria no longer poses any threat to its neighbors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But the country remains under a host of international sanctions imposed during the regime of Mr. al-Assad. And the new interim government is run by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which many countries have blacklisted as a terrorist group for its erstwhile ties to Al Qaeda, although it broke with the group several years ago.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/07/multimedia/07syria-airport-zkbf/07syria-airport-zkbf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/07/multimedia/07syria-airport-zkbf/07syria-airport-zkbf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/07/multimedia/07syria-airport-zkbf/07syria-airport-zkbf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Passengers in a boarding line." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/07/multimedia/07syria-airport-zkbf/07syria-airport-zkbf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/07/multimedia/07syria-airport-zkbf/07syria-airport-zkbf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/07/multimedia/07syria-airport-zkbf/07syria-airport-zkbf-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/07/multimedia/07syria-airport-zkbf/07syria-airport-zkbf-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/06d937a1-de50-5b16-80a0-4b49300e368c" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Passengers boarding a flight at Damascus International Airport on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Louai Beshara/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Western leaders have responded to the new administration with a mix of optimism and caution, fearing that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/world/middleeast/syria-government-school-changes.html" title="">impose</a> Islamist rule on the country or generate a new wave of domestic turmoil.

As soon as Mr. al-Assad <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/world/middleeast/assad-regime-syria-final-days.html" title="">fled</a> the country in December, one of the first requests of Ahmed al-Shara, the leader of the rebel coalition that overthrew the government, was for the United States and others to begin easing restrictions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Monday, the Biden administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/us/politics/syria-us-sanctions-aid.html" title="">lifted</a> some restrictions on humanitarian aid to Syria.
