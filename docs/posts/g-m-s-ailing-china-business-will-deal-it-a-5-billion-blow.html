Founded in 1997, the venture once grew steadily and generated considerable profits.</p><p>But over the last several years, the business has lost market share to Chinese manufacturers that invested heavily in electric and hybrid cars, which have come to account for more than half of all vehicles sold in China.</p><p>G.M. said in a regulatory filing that it would report an expense of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter to reflect the reduction in the value of G.M.’s investment in its Chinese joint venture on its balance sheet. Another $2.7 billion expense, most of which will be recognized in the fourth quarter, will reflect G.M.’s share of the cost of restructuring measures the joint venture will take.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In the first nine months of the year, G.M. lost $347 million on its Chinese operations. Its sales in the country fell nearly 20 percent in that period, while its market share dropped to 6.8 percent, from 8.6 percent a year earlier and more than 15 percent in 2015.</p><p>The announcement indicates that G.M. does not expect its Chinese operations to rebound soon.</p><p>“We are focused on capital efficiency and cost discipline and have been working with SGM to turn around the business in China in order to be sustainable and profitable in the market,” the company said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. “We are close to finalizing our restructuring plan with our partner, and we expect our results in China in 2025 to show year-over-year improvement.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>G.M.’s troubles in China, the world’s largest vehicle market, reflect a broader trend. Almost all foreign automakers there, including European, Japanese and South Korean companies, are struggling as increasingly ambitious Chinese car companies like BYD and Geely introduce new models and slash prices. Many of those automakers are also exporting a growing number of cars to other countries in Asia, Europe and Latin America.</p><p>Ford Motor has been working to streamline and reorganize its Chinese joint venture for several years. The automaker spent $881 million restructuring the business in the first nine months of the year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Volkswagen, an early entrant into the Chinese market, was the top-selling automaker in the country for four decades. But its business there has slumped as car buyers have quickly turned to electric and hybrid vehicles made by BYD, which is vying this year to pass Tesla as the world’s largest producer of electric cars, and by others.</p><p>BYD also appears poised to pass Ford this year to become the world’s sixth-largest automaker overall.</p><p>Volkswagen’s vehicle sales in China have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/business/volkswagen-china.html" title="">dropped more than 10 percent</a> this year, compounding other troubles for the German company. It recently said it might have to close factories in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/business/volkswagen-strikes.html" title="">its home country</a> for the first time.</p><p>Last week, Volkswagen said it was looking to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/business/volkswagen-xinjiang-saic.html" title="">sell stakes in operations in China’s northwestern Xinjiang region</a>, where the authorities have cracked down harshly on a predominantly Muslim ethnic group that lives there.</p><p>Chinese banks and local governments have provided low-cost loans, land and other incentives to locally owned automakers, enabling some to sell cars for less than they cost to produce.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In an October letter to shareholders, G.M.’s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said the company was seeing improvements in its Chinese operations. Sales in China in the third quarter were better than in the second, while dealer inventory fell sharply and electric vehicle sales were on track to hit the company’s 2024 production and profit targets.</p><p>G.M. is solidly profitable in North America, which is where the company makes the vast majority of its profits. In October, the automaker said it expected to report 2024 net income of $10.4 billion to $11.1 billion.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Neal E.
