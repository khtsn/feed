But the question before the justices was narrower: whether a single district court judge has the power to block a policy across the country.</p><p>Here are four takeaways from the arguments.</p><h2 id="link-2a9a8984">The case was not really about birthright citizenship.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-1"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>During oral arguments on Thursday, Supreme Court justices were not considering the legal merits of an order signed by President Trump shortly after his inauguration that reinterpreted the meaning of the 14th Amendment, which has long been understood to grant automatic citizenship to nearly everyone born on U.S. soil.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>The argument here is that the president is violating an established — not just one, but by my count, four established Supreme Court precedents. We have the Wong Ark case where we said fealty to a foreign sovereign doesn’t defeat your entitlement. Your parents’ fealty to a foreign sovereign doesn’t defeat your entitlement to citizenship as a child. We have another case where we said that even if your parents are here illegally, if you’re born here, you’re a citizen. We have yet another case that says, even if your parents came here and were stopped at the border and — but you were born in our territory, you’re still a citizen. And we have another case that says even if your parents secured citizenship illegally, you’re still a citizen. So as far as I see it, this order violates four Supreme Court precedents.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/15/multimedia/15dc-takeaways-trump-wckh/15dc-takeaways-trump-wckh-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">During oral arguments on Thursday, Supreme Court justices were not considering the legal merits of an order signed by President Trump shortly after his inauguration that reinterpreted the meaning of the 14th Amendment, which has long been understood to grant automatic citizenship to nearly everyone born on U.S. soil.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The justices were not considering the legal merits of Mr. Trump’s order, even though it brought greater attention to the arguments on Thursday.</p><p>Shortly after being sworn in to his second term, Mr. Trump signed an order that reinterpreted the meaning of the 14th Amendment, which has long been understood to grant automatic citizenship to nearly everyone born on U.S. soil.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The order seeks to deny citizenship to babies born to undocumented migrants and visitors without green cards. As a practical matter, that would start with agencies in the executive branch refusing them citizenship-affirming documents like Social Security cards.</p><p>Multiple courts around the country have blocked the government from obeying that order, ruling that it is most likely illegal. They did so using universal injunctions, or orders that apply nationwide and cover people in similar situations who were not parties to the cases. At this stage, the Trump administration is challenging only the ability of courts to issue such orders.</p><p>Still, the underlying issue came up several times. Several justices expressed skepticism about the legality of Mr. Trump’s proclamation. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, for example, said that it violated, “by my count, four established Supreme Court precedents.” No justice expressed clear support for the legality of the order.</p><h2 id="link-9dfc5e4">Justices asked about the history of universal injunctions.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-5"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>Justice Clarence Thomas suggested at times that nationwide injunctions did not have deep roots in American jurisprudence, although some scholars have challenged those assertions.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“The cases that we cite like National Treasury, Treasury’s employment union, Perkins against Lukens Oil, Frothingham and Massachusetts against Mellon, and going back to Scott against Donald and all of those, those are cases where the court considered and addressed the universal in that case, statewide issue of provision of injunctive relief. So when the court has considered and addressed this, it has consistently said you have to limit the remedy to the plaintiffs who appearing in court and complaining of that remedy.” “So we survived until the 1960s without universal injunctions?” “That’s exactly correct. And in fact, those were very limited, very rare, even in the 1960s. It really exploded in 2007, in our cert petition in Summers against Earth Island Institute, we pointed out that the Ninth Circuit had started doing this and a whole bunch of cases involving environmental claims.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/15/multimedia/15dc-takeaways-thomas-tmwb/15dc-takeaways-thomas-tmwb-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Justice Clarence Thomas suggested at times that nationwide injunctions did not have deep roots in American jurisprudence, although some scholars have challenged those assertions.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Some of the justices — particularly its longest sitting member, Justice Clarence Thomas — seemed interested in the history of nationwide injunctions, suggesting at times that the practice did not have deep roots in American jurisprudence. The Supreme Court has rejected certain legal practices — most prominently, the constitutional right to abortion — by arguing that they were not traditionally recognized in U.S. law.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>At one point, Justice Thomas said the nation had “survived until the 1960s” without the use of nationwide injunctions. While some legal scholars have <a href="https://harvardlawreview.org/print/vol-133/the-lost-history-of-the-universal-injunction/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">challenged that assertion</a>, pointing to examples of the tool’s use as far back as 1913, Justice Thomas seemed to be expressing skepticism about the widespread use of the injunctions.</p><p>Echoing that position, D. John Sauer, the U.S. solicitor general, said that courts have typically worked by addressing claims filed by individuals. He noted that during the flurry of legislative changes enacted during the New Deal in the 1930s, one policy in particular prompted lawsuits from more than 1,000 separate plaintiffs.</p><p>These days were different, Mr. Sauer said, pointing out that nearly 40 nationwide injunctions had been entered by a court in the past four months. He said the number of such injunctions had soared over the past five administrations, describing it as a “bipartisan problem.”</p><h2 id="link-2112bf5">The justices also wrestled with practicalities.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-9"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>Jeremy M. Feigenbaum, New Jersey’s solicitor general, pointed out problems in the “workability” of the issue if it went to a state-by-state basis.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>We’ve never in this country’s history, since the Civil War, had your citizenship turn on when you crossed state lines. So we don’t have answers to these workability questions, not just because it wasn’t presented in the district court, not just because it’s two sentences in an emergency application, but because for over a century, executive practice has been uniformly to the contrary, building on this court’s decision in Wong Kim Ark. So we genuinely don’t know how this could possibly work on the ground. And although my friend on the other side has complained that they weren’t able to give guidance, the states didn’t object to guidance. The states have no quarrel with internal steps. And if they want to put out guidance that says if Wong Kim Ark gets overruled, this is what we would do. That’s fine. What they can’t do is require us to take any steps or issue guidance that requires everyone to start planning for something that is so patently against this court’s own settled precedent.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/15/multimedia/15dc-takeaways-ssa-bmlc/15dc-takeaways-ssa-bmlc-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Jeremy M.

The lawyers worried that before the Supreme Court issued a final ruling on the question of birthright citizenship, there could be “chaos on the ground” if some states were allowed to keep the practice and others states did not.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Jeremy M. Feigenbaum, New Jersey’s solicitor general, pointed out that if Mr. Trump’s policy prevailed in certain states, children of immigrants born there might not be able to get Social Security numbers. That could become a problem, he suggested, if they later moved to states that did recognize them as citizens, particularly if they tried to apply for government benefits.</p><p>Mr. Feigenbaum also noted that if a person’s citizenship depended on what state they were in, there could be widespread confusion about their immigration status as well. He wondered aloud whether the children of immigrants might be subject to deportation in states that did not recognize birthright citizenship and yet be shielded from removal in states that did.</p><h2 id="link-65f5bce7">Several worried about a potential loophole.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-13"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>D.

How do you suggest we reach this case on the merits expeditiously?” “There is a number of tools the court could do that. We think this case is one that cries out for percolation, that the court should allow the lower courts to address the merits issue multiple times. It’s currently on briefing in three different cases in the First, Fourth and Ninth Circuits, and we think that that’s the appropriate way to do it.

That, she said, would allow it to keep denying citizenship documents to the overwhelming number of babies who were born to parents who lacked the resources or wherewithal to sue.</p><p>Mr. Sauer suggested that a class-action lawsuit might be the way to solve that problem, but he also acknowledged that the administration would most likely argue that the standards were not met to grant class certification to all children affected by Mr. Trump’s order.</p><p>Justice Neil M. Gorsuch remarked, “Justice Kagan asked my questions better than I could have,” leading to a rare moment of laughter in the courtroom. He again pressed Mr. Sauer, “How do you suggest we reach this on the merits expeditiously?”</p><p>Justice Gorsuch went on to ask whether the administration intended to appeal to the Supreme Court after it lost — he said “when” that happens, not “if” — on the merits before an appeals court.</p><p>“If we lose?” Mr. Sauer replied. “Yes, absolutely.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Charlie Savage writes about national security and legal policy for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
