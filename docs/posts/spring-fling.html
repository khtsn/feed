    <h1>Spring Fling</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>It’s the time of year when we become reacquainted with what’s been hiding out in the back of the closet. The weather’s turning, necessitating an unearthing, a rediscovery of clothes that have been hanging there silently, awaiting their turn. Here in the Northern Hemisphere, at the back end of May, there are gradually — almost begrudgingly — more warm days than cool ones. One day soon you’ll hang up your coat for the last time and won’t think about it again until fall.</p><p>I’ve been taking bags of clothes to the thrift store, stuff that I’ve hung onto for too long, that’s been occupying hangers and drawer space and head space. It feels good to part with things, to get that real estate back in both my apartment and my brain. No longer must I have a conversation with that green jacket every time I open the hall closet, no longer is it part of the consideration set. Get rid of enough old things and you can almost see your life a little more clearly. You think those old polo shirts are just sitting there, not harming anyone, but once they’re gone, there’s just less to contemplate.</p><p>My friend Minju told me she was cleaning out her closet recently and happened upon that big box of loose snapshots anyone who came of age before digital cameras has hiding in the recesses of their storage nook. She pulled the box down from the shelf and began going through them, photos of her as a child, in high school and college, old pictures of her family. She’d always planned to “do something” with the pictures, as we all do, but what? Put them in an album? Digitize them so they’ll be captured on our devices with the rest of our cloud-contained archives? Deciding she wanted to keep the photos close at hand so she’d actually look at them, Minju selected a bunch to put in a basket in her living room. Now, when she’s sitting on the couch, instead of scrolling on her phone, she might pick up the stack of photos. When visitors come over, they might flip through them.</p><p>Spring cleaning airs things out, replaces stacks of rarely worn sweaters with room to maneuver. It feels good to get rid of things, but it also feels good to purposefully decide what to fill the space with. What else are we storing in closets and crawl spaces, out of sight and mind, that we’d like to have present in our everyday lives? The old pictures, the love letters, the postcards and birthday cards and childhood artwork and binders full of mix CDs, maybe shoeboxes full of mix tapes. All those things we saved to do something with someday. What might we do with them now?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><p>Trump Administration</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><ul><li><p>The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/supreme-court-alien-enemies-act-deportations.html" title="">extended the ban</a> on the Trump administration’s use of a wartime law to deport Venezuelans while a lower court re-examines the case.</p></li><li><p>After intelligence agencies undercut the White House’s justification for deporting Venezuelan migrants, a Trump appointee <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/trump-appointee-venezuela-gang.html" title="">told an intelligence official to redo the assessment</a>.</p></li><li><p>The Department of Homeland Security is considering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/homeland-security-immigration-reality-show.html?smid=url-share" title="">taking part in a reality TV show</a> that would have immigrants go through a series of challenges to win American citizenship.</p></li><li><p>Senate Democrats oppose more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/trump-democrats-weapons-sales.html" title="">$3 billion in proposed weapons sales</a> to Qatar and the U.A.E., saying those countries have cultivated inappropriate financial ties to Trump.</p></li><li><p>Several Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/house-republicans-policy-bil.html?smid=url-share" title="">blocked their party’s megabill</a> from advancing because they said it would add too much to the deficit.</p></li></ul><p>Other Big Stories</p><ul><li><p>At least four people were killed after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/weather/storms-missouri-kentucky-indiana-illinois.html" title="">tornado struck St. Louis</a>, leaving a trail of collapsed buildings, uprooted trees and downed power lines.</p></li><li><p>Ten inmates <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/new-orleans-jail-escape.html" title="">escaped from a New Orleans jail</a> after removing a toilet from the wall.

Harvard sued, and the government has canceled billions in research grants. I sat down with McMahon in her office yesterday and asked how she could patch things up and what else she wants to achieve. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/us/politics/linda-mcmahon-harvard-trump.html" title="">Read about the interview here</a>. Below is one exchange, condensed and edited for clarity. <em>— Michael C. Bender</em></p><p><strong>Are we witnessing a divorce between Harvard and the federal government?</strong></p><p>No, that’s definitely not the goal. The goal is to … make sure [students] have the right skills that they need.</p><p><strong>The government has a half-dozen investigations of Harvard.

When you’re sitting and talking, do you have to have all your lawyers present?</p><p><strong>Has the push against Harvard been a success? Is the administration winning here?</strong></p><p>We did see the head of Middle Eastern Studies changed. … And I think that [Harvard President Alan Garber] is saying, <em>We are moving in the directions that you want us to move in.</em></p><p><strong>He has made some changes around student discipline and managing protests.</strong></p><p>Yeah, and all that is good. And I think we have forced their hand to do that, because they weren’t doing it before. And so I think we have forced other universities to see that the president was serious with what he said.</p><h3 id="link-1439ed98"><span><strong>THE WEEK IN CULTURE</strong></span></h3><p>Art</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Alberto Giacometti’s “Grande tête mince (Grande tête de Diego).”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Succession Alberto Giacometti/Artists Rights Society (ARS), NY; via Sotheby&#39;s</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><ul><li><p>A bronze sculpture by Alberto Giacometti was supposed to be the star of New York’s spring art auctions.
