It has outlawed large flags, banners and signs from El Capitan and most of the park altogether.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The ban appears to have been formalized last month by Yosemite’s acting superintendent, Raymond McPadden, in a <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/management/upload/yose-compendium.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Park Service compendium</a> of regulations dated May 20.</p><p>The rule tracks with a series of punitive actions by the Trump administration against some critics of its immigration policies and Palestinian sympathizers.</p><p>Violators could face up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $5,000 for individuals and $10,000 for groups — penalties already in place for various offenses in the park.</p><p>“This restriction is necessary to preserve the values of wilderness character in accordance with the Wilderness Act, provide for an unimpaired visitor experience, protect natural and cultural resources in designated Wilderness and Potential Wilderness Addition portions of the park,” Mr. McPadden wrote.</p><p>Parks officials also cast the display of large flags — those greater than 3 feet by 5 feet — on any of the cliffs or mountains in Yosemite as a potential safety hazard that they said could interfere with climbing activity. Flags larger than that size would require a permit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Park Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday about the new rule, which was reported earlier by <a href="https://www.climbing.com/news/yosemite-bans-large-flags-on-el-cap-and-other-walls/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Climbing</a> magazine and <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/california-parks/article/yosemite-national-park-bans-flags-penalty-jail-20368977.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SFGate.com</a>.
