    <h1>U.S. Officials Try to Advance Israel’s Cease-Fire Talks With Hezbollah and Hamas</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Multiple versions of a potential Gaza proposal are still under discussion. One would release female hostages along with male captives over 50 in return for a set number of Palestinian prisoners, according to a person briefed on the discussions, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. In that version, the fighting in Gaza would pause for some time, but likely less than the six weeks envisioned in a previous deal negotiators had been pushing.</p><p>In another proposed deal, Hamas would release four hostages over roughly 10 days, according to a second official briefed on the negotiations.</p><p>Mr. Gallant’s office said he and the U.S. envoys had discussed the conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon and the efforts to free the hostages.</p><p>Officials in Washington and the Middle East are pessimistic that Hamas would accept any of the new deals. Hamas officials have repeatedly said they would only consider a deal that permanently ends the war — a stance that Taher el-Nunu, a Hamas spokesman, reiterated on Thursday.</p><p>“Hamas supports a permanent end to the war, not a temporary one,” he said in an interview with Agence France-Presse.</p><p>Some U.S. officials believe that Hamas leaders, like some Israeli officials, see waiting as advantageous. Israel’s longstanding conflict with Hezbollah, which reignited when the Lebanon-based armed group began firing on Israeli positions last October in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza, has ballooned from a regular but relatively restrained exchange of fire into Israeli ground operations and airstrikes inside Lebanon.</p><p>Hezbollah has also continued attacking Israel targets. On Thursday, local officials in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-metula.html" title="">Metula</a>, in northern Israel, said that projectiles fired from Lebanon had struck an agricultural area, killing four foreign workers and an Israeli farmer. A separate rocket strike killed two people in an olive grove, according to Israel’s emergency service. The attacks across the border have forced tens of thousands of people in Israel and more than a million in Lebanon to evacuate their homes.</p><p>After Mr. Netanyahu’s meeting with the U.S. officials, his office released a statement focused on the conflict with Hezbollah, emphasizing Israel’s need to “thwart any threat to its security from Lebanon, in a way that will return our residents safely to their homes.” The statement did not mention Gaza.</p><p>On Wednesday, a draft cease-fire proposal to address the fighting with Hezbollah was published by Israeli news media, prompting a U.S. National Security Council spokesman, Sean Savett, to warn that such reports should be viewed with skepticism.</p><p>“There are many reports and drafts circulating,” he said in a statement. “They do not reflect the current state of negotiations.”</p><p>The draft suggested that Hezbollah would withdraw from the Israel-Lebanon border in accordance with a United Nations Security Council resolution enacted in 2006 that was never implemented. It also suggested that the Lebanese military, which has been sidelined by Hezbollah in southern Lebanon in recent decades, would fill the void, preventing Hezbollah from rearming.</p><p>Analysts said that Hezbollah would balk at that arrangement, suggesting that it would be unlikely to gain traction.</p><p>“It’s too early to discuss these points, and I think it won’t be accepted by Hezbollah,” said Kassem Kassir, an analyst close to Hezbollah.</p><p>Myra Noveck<!-- --> and <!-- -->Hwaida Saad<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div>
