It will also allow the new Syrian government to gain access to funds and technical support to rebuild institutions and try to speed up development, Qatar and Saudi Arabia said in a joint statement.</p><p>The Syrian government in Damascus, the capital, expressed its “deep gratitude” for the move. “It also opens the door to activating cooperation with international institutions to serve the issues of recovery and reconstruction,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.</p><p>The government in Syria still faces major hurdles in trying to rebuild the country after the nearly 14-year war that led to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/world/middleeast/assad-regime-syria-final-days.html" title="">the ouster of Bashar al-Assad</a> in December.

Long lines regularly form at banks as people try to withdraw money from their accounts, hundreds of civil servants have been dismissed and some public subsidies have been eliminated.</p><p>Early hopes that the Western sanctions imposed on Syria to punish the Assad regime would be lifted quickly have been dashed. Some governments, including those of the European Union and of Britain, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/world/middleeast/britain-lifts-sanctions-syria.html" title="">eased sanctions</a>, and the United States has issued a general license, allowing for some exemptions of American restrictions for six months.</p><p>But the Trump administration has imposed a number of conditions before it will lift sanctions.
