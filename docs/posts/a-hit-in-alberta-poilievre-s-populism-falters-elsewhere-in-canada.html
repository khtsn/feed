He believed that Mr. Carney — who served as the head of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England — was worse than former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p><p>“He’s World Economic Forum,” Mr. Grundberg said. “They want to crush this country and crush the middle class.”</p><p>The CBC and other television networks were “bought and paid for,” Mr. Grundberg said, adding that he got his news from “<a href="https://northernperspective.ca/about/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Northern Perspective</a>,” an online news site that says it focuses on “radical leftist promoted legislation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>In Canada, only 12 percent of voters have a favorable opinion of Mr. Trump, according to a <a href="https://leger360.com/trumpists-in-canada/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poll</a> last month by Léger, a major firm based in Montreal. But the number climbs to 27 percent among Conservatives. At the same time, nearly half of all respondents in another Léger <a href="https://leger360.com/federal-politics-week-of-march-31/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poll</a> said they viewed Mr. Poilievre as similar to Mr. Trump.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-13"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Political fashion statements at the rally in Nisku.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“The difficulty for Mr. Poilievre in going beyond his base and becoming the strongest defender of Canada is his association with Trump,” Jean-Marc Léger, the president and chief executive of the firm, said in an interview.</p><p>A spokesman for Mr. Poilievre’s campaign did not respond to a message seeking an interview for this article.</p><p>After becoming Conservative leader in 2022, Mr. Poilievre borrowed from Mr. Trump’s style and message to build a seemingly insurmountable lead against the Liberals led by Mr. Trudeau. He toured the country with the message that Canada was “broken” because elite “gatekeepers” in politics, business and media were aligned against the “common sense” of ordinary Canadians.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>He channeled anger against Mr. Trudeau but also against the news media, giving interviews instead to far-right online news sites and podcasters. He singled out the World Economic Forum — he accused Mr. Trudeau and the Liberals of using forum events to promote their <a href="https://www.conservative.ca/cpc/workers-not-wef/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“radical woke agenda”</a> — and said he would ban his future ministers from participating in any of its conferences.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Poilievre has borrowed from Mr. Trump’s style and message, though his association with the U.S. president has hurt him in the polls.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Nanette James, 53, a self-employed Conservative at the rally, said that Mr. Poilievre’s message resonated with her.</p><p>“I do feel that it is being broken,” Ms. James said of Canada, adding, “I have children, I’ll eventually have grandchildren. I’d like to have them grow up in the Canada that I grew up in.”</p><p>Ms. James said she liked Mr. Trump.</p><p>“I mean sometimes he says something and I say, ‘Oh my god, I can’t believe he said that,’” she said. “But he’s honest. He’s not a politician.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>In Mr. Poilievre’s 50-minute speech at the rally, he barely mentioned Mr. Trump, saying only, “Donald Trump doesn’t get to choose our next prime minister.”</p><p>Criticizing Mr. Trump would alienate part of the Conservative base, especially in Alberta, said <a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/jwesley" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jared Wesley</a>, a political scientist at the University of Alberta.</p><p>When Mr. Poilievre has criticized Mr. Trump, he has been careful to limit his comments to tariffs, Mr. Wesley said. Mr. Poilievre has avoided mentioning other Trump policies, partly because of similarities with his own, including Mr. Poilievre’s pledge to fight against “woke ideology” by withholding federal funds to universities, Mr. Wesley said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Poilievre’s Trump-like populism plays well in Alberta, but not nearly as much elsewhere in Canada.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>An equally significant problem for Mr. Poilievre is that “prominent conservative leaders in Alberta are actively undermining his message and his attempt to steer the party to the center,” Mr. Wesley said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Danielle Smith, Alberta’s conservative premier, has been cozying up to the Trump administration even as she has distanced herself from the federal government and other provincial leaders in Canada’s response to U.S. tariffs.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/03/08/exclusive-canadian-premier-danielle-smith-trudeau-blew-tariff-negotiations-first-mar-a-lago-meeting/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> last month with Breitbart, the far-right American news site, Ms. Smith said Mr. Poilievre would be “very much in sync” with “the new direction in America.”</p><p>And then early this month, Preston Manning, the founder of the Reform Party — a right-wing populist movement established in the late 1980s that has now come to dominate the Conservative Party — <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-mark-carney-is-a-threat-to-national-unity/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> in the Globe and Mail that a win by the Liberals would fuel separatism in Western Canada.</p><p>Mr. Poilievre, who got his start in politics by joining the Reform Party as a teenager, rejected the idea of secession, saying, “We need to unite the country.”</p><p>In an interview, Mr. Manning said he simply wanted to point out that “Western alienation has been brewing and getting stronger” because of the Liberal government’s opposition to building fuel pipelines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Canadian and American flags in the window of a home in downtown Edmonton, Alberta.
