    <h1>Brazilian Artist Sends a Message to the Country’s Biggest Soy Exporter</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Two weeks ago, on a rooftop 11 stories above São Paulo, a popular Brazilian street artist, Mundano, sat on an overturned bucket, mixing water, varnish and ash collected from fires that had ripped through a Brazilian rainforest to create a palette of gray tones.</p><p>Over the ledge awaited a newly whitewashed, 15,000-square-foot wall of an elegant apartment building in plain view of the buses and cars heading down a main artery leading to the city center.</p><p>That evening, he and five assistant artists would start painting a massive mural of an Indigenous leader, Alessandra Korap, in a scorched Amazonian landscape, holding up a sign urging Cargill, the Minnesota-based agricultural giant, to rid its supply chain of crops grown on recently deforested land.</p><p>The project is a collaboration with the conservation nonprofit Stand.Earth, which is funding the mural as part of a <a href="https://burninglegacy.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">campaign</a> targeting Cargill.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The final result is to be officially unveiled on Wednesday, though it is hardly a secret to the supermarket shoppers, passers-by and those who work in the small shops that surround a parking lot below the mural.</p><p>“I’m already tired and we haven’t started yet,” said Mundano, whose (rarely mentioned) first name is Thiago.</p></div></div><div

eight suspended scaffolds (like the ones window-washers use).</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>They used paints made with ash from fires in the Atlantic Rainforest in Brazil, mud from floods that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/world/americas/brazil-flooding-photos.html" title="">destroyed</a> swaths of the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, charcoal from charred Amazonian trees and clay from drought-plagued river basins across the country.</p><p>“I’m connecting the droughts and the floods and the fires because it’s all linked,” said Mundano, who claims this will be Brazil’s largest mural painted with only natural materials (plus a water-based acrylic varnish), a style that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/street-art-emerges-sao-paulo-ashes-burning-amazon-2021-10-15/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has become his trademark</a>.</p><p>The final step was to fill in the six-story-high sign held in the mural by Ms. Korap, a member of the Munduruku tribe who was raised in Pará state. It reads: “Stop the destruction” in English and Portuguese, with the hashtag #KeepYourPromise.</p><p>The “promise” refers to a <a href="https://www.cargill.com/2023/cargill-announces-commitment-to-eliminate-deforestation" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pledge</a> Cargill made in November 2023, setting 2025 as a deadline “to eliminate deforestation and land conversion from its direct and indirect supply chain” of soy and other crops in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. Cargill is one of the largest exporters of Brazilian soy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mundano, left, and his assistant analyzing the color details of the mural against a photo of Ms. Korap.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Artists made their paints using ash from burned Amazon forests, mud from floods, charcoal from charred trees and clay from drought-plagued river basins in Brazil.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I want to show an image of our struggle, of this fearless warrior woman” said Ms. Korap, who was <a href="https://www.goldmanprize.org/recipient/alessandra-korap-munduruku/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one</a> of six winners of the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize in 2023. “It says we’re alive, we’re fighting every single day.”</p><p>In <a href="https://burninglegacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stand-BurningLegacy-BadApples.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an April report</a>, Stand.Earth cited 18 companies with “confirmed or suspected links” to Cargill that have deforested or converted wild land to soy production. The environmental advocacy group covered the mural’s cost, around $80,000, according to Mathew Jacobson, the Cargill campaign’s director.</p><p>In a statement, Cargill said it was “on track to deliver” on its commitment “to eliminate deforestation in soy supply chains’’ in the region.</p><p>It also accused Stand.Earth of misrepresenting Cargill’s work.</p><p>Of the companies listed in the April report, Cargill said, two are not in its supply chain, three have been removed and four have not done business with Cargill for years. Cargill said it had investigated the others and cleared them of using deforesting land for crops.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Earlier this week, Mundano and his crew methodically painted, filmed and then used brooms and water-filled fire extinguishers to erase 21 versions of the sign calling out members of the billionaire Cargill-MacMillan family, who together control the company.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mundano using water to erase signs calling out members of the Cargill-MacMillan family.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Brooms also were used to erase the names. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The versions were based on paintings made by members of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/world/americas/brazil-indigenous-mining-bolsonaro.html" title="">Munduruku</a> community at a workshop Mundano held with Ms. Korap in July. They will be delivered by Mr. Jacobson to the Cargill families’ homes in the United States.</p><p>“We see them as the leaders and the driving force of the industry that’s most responsible for the destruction of the forests and other landscapes as well,” Mr. Jacobson said, noting that Cargill’s private ownership avoids accountability to shareholders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“Because of the amount of resources the owners have, the idea of putting in place systems to monitor those things is incumbent on them,’’ he added, “instead of continuing to profit from the destruction.”</p><p>Cargill more than doubled its profit in Brazil from 2022 to 2023, the company <a href="https://www.cargill.com.br/pt_BR/2024/resultadosbrasilano2023" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> in April.</p><p>The campaign is also targeting a long-planned and much-delayed 580-mile railway known as the <a href="https://www.datamarnews.com/noticias/ferrograo-rail-project-yet-again-center-of-environmentalists-concern/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ferrogrão</a>, or Grain Rail, which is meant to make it easier to transport agricultural and mining products to the Amazonian river port of Miritituba.</p><p>Parts of the planned route of the privately financed government project slice through protected lands.</p><p>Cargill said it was “not part of the consortium that was formed to build’’ the railway, but said that increasing transportation capacity while protecting the environment was vital to feeding the world.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The artist known as Hulk, left, and Mundano checking out the progress of the painting.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Daniel Wera smoking a petyngua, a ceremonial pipe, before starting work.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>By last week, the artists at the mural site had their routines down. An artist known as Hullk (whose real name is André França), a native of Manaus, a city in Amazonas State, grated dried guaraná fruit into water to make a natural stimulant commonly used in his region.</p><p>Daniel Wera, smoked a petyngua, a ceremonial pipe used by the Guarani people he has worked with in the São Paulo region. “I use it so I don’t forget why I’m here,” he said. “I’m here to represent the forest.”</p><p>Two sheets of paper displayed over 20 earth and ash tones and their “recipes.” Mundano sat on a varnish bucket, grating clay collected from a drought-stricken region near Ms. Korap’s home in Pará state.. The resulting shade would be used for the traces of smoke floating by trees in the mural’s background.</p><p>“Is there any Atlantic rainforest left?” said another artist, André Firmiano, referring not to the fast-disappearing Brazilian ecosystem but to the dark gray tone used to outline the trees.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“No,” someone said.</p><p>“So let’s make some more.”</p><p>Later, Mr. Wera and Mr. Hullk hung from one of the eight scaffolds, adding detail to the feathers that make up Ms. Korap’s towering tiara, checking their work against a laminated photo of her.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mundano and his assistants worked from eight suspended scaffolds.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I’m connecting the droughts and the floods and the fires because it’s all linked,” Mundano said.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Down below, shoppers and workers regularly looked up, curious and mostly admiring.</p><p>“This mural was a gift,” said Frankie Medici, 46, who runs the XBull Grill burger stand next to the lot<span>  </span>and had grown accustomed to the drab gray paint that preceded the mural.</p><p>“Customers have taken so many photos and wondering what’s going in the sign,’’ he said. “It will be a jab at someone, at the very least.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>A few shoppers made pointed jokes, wondering if taxpayer money was financing the art (it was not) and whether the warning to “stop the destruction” was directed at Brazil’s leftist president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
