The measure also prohibited Israeli officials from engaging with officials and employees of UNRWA.</p><p>The move came after months of tensions between the Israeli government and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/world/middleeast/unrwa-gaza-aid.html" title="">the U.N. agency</a>, which provides food, shelter, health care, vocational training and education to Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza, especially in the aftermath of the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel that set off the war. The agency also aids Palestinians who live in neighboring countries like Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, where Palestinians displaced in the founding of Israel have lived for decades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Israel has accused UNRWA of being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/02/world/americas/israel-unrwa-gaza-threat.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">infiltrated by members of Hamas</a>. But two U.N. investigations found that fewer than 10 employees out of nearly 13,000 were affiliated with the armed Palestinian group, and they were fired.</p><p>Two hundred and sixty-nine of UNRWA’s staff members have been killed in Gaza — the largest loss of life among U.N. employees in any conflict, officials say.</p><p>Mr. Danon said in the letter that Israel would continue to cooperate with the U.N. and “any of its agencies that have not been infiltrated by terror organizations.”</p><p>Asked for comment, Farhan Haq, a U.N. spokesman, referred to previous statements by Mr. Guterres fiercely defending the work of UNRWA as irreplaceable and essential, particularly in Gaza, where Israeli bombardment to root out Hamas has displaced most of the population and killed about 47,000 people, according to Gazan officials, who do no distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p><p>A spokeswoman for UNRWA also referred requests for comments to Mr. Guterres’s office, since the letter was addressed to him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Guterres told a meeting of the U.N. Security Council earlier this week on the situation in Gaza, “First, United Nations entities — including the backbone of our humanitarian response, UNRWA — must be able to perform their functions without hindrance.”</p><p>UNRWA’s chief, Philippe Lazzarini, also asked the Council last week to intervene to stop Israel from enforcing the legislation outlawing his agency. He said such actions “will massively weaken the international humanitarian response” in Gaza and “immeasurably worsen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/18/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire/unrwas-head-warns-of-catastrophe-for-gaza-if-israel-stops-its-work?smid=url-share" title="">already catastrophic living conditions.</a>”</p><p>Before the letter was sent, Mr. Lazzarini told reporters last Friday that his agency had received no clear directive from Israel on how the measures would be carried out. He also said that he expected UNRWA to continue its work, albeit with enormous logistical challenges in the West Bank and Gaza, and that its work in Jerusalem would be compromised.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>UNRWA provides food, shelter, health care, vocational training and education to Palestinians in places like the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ahmad Gharabli/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In the letter, Israel demanded that UNRWA evacuate two sites in the Maalot Dafna and Kfar Aqueb neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, which is considered by international law to be part of the West Bank and under occupation.

After Israel accused Hamas of infiltrating the agency, the Biden administration <a href="https://unwatch.org/updated-list-of-countries-suspending-unwra-funding/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suspended</a> millions in annual funding to UNRWA, and Congress in March <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12316#:~:text=In%20March%202024%20(in%20Division,%2C%20until%20March%2025%2C%202025." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prohibited U.S. funding to the organization for a year</a>.</p><p>During his first presidential term, Donald J. Trump withdrew funding for UNRWA in 2018, and he is expected to continue restricting funding.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s pick to be U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Representative Elise Stefanik, criticized the relief agency as “antisemitic” in her Senate hearing this week, and said she supported Israel’s “biblical rights” over the West Bank.</p><p>That position is at odds with the U.N.’s stance that the West Bank is occupied Palestinian territory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Lazzarini said <a href="https://x.com/UNLazzarini/status/1882895011689214339" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a post on X</a> on Friday that preventing UNRWA from operating “might sabotage” the provisional cease-fire recently struck between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, “failing once again hopes of people who have gone through unspeakable suffering.”</p><p>He said that, in the first three days of the truce, UNRWA brought in food for one million people in Gaza and had already distributed it to about 3,000 people in northern Gaza, where the U.N. and aid agencies have warned that people were at the brink of famine.</p><p>“The work of UNRWA must continue in Gaza + across the occupied Palestinian territory,” Mr. Lazzarini said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Farnaz Fassihi is the United Nations bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the organization, and also covers Iran and the shadow war between Iran and Israel.
