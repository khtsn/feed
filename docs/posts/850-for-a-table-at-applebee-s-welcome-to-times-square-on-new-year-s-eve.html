For some revelers, the convenience and dining options are worth the price, which rises as availability goes down.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I showed up an hour before the doors opened,” said Evan Lund, who traveled from Colorado to attend the Applebee’s New Year’s Eve event in 2022 and 2023 and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/paid-spend-new-years-eve-applebees-2024-1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shared his experience with Business Insider</a> this year. “You get to stay inside, nice and warm and all that until you go to the party, so you don’t have to deal with all the other crazy stuff.”</p><p>Mr. Lund, 37, was not alone. The <a href="https://www.balldrop.com/new-years-eve-applebees-times-square" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">event at Applebee’s</a> has sold out for a number of years, according to Doherty Enterprises, which owns the chain, as people have sought a more intimate view of the confetti and ball drop. Applebee’s hosts events at its locations on West 42nd Street and West 50th Street.</p><p>The hefty price tag — $729 to nearly $2,300 for a “private couple’s package” — includes more than just breathing room and bathrooms.</p><p>One of the more economical options, two seats at a communal table for $849 a ticket, comes with an open bar from 7 p.m. to midnight; a dinner buffet including sirloin, barbecue “riblets” and pasta primavera; and passed appetizers such as Double Crunch boneless wings, mini frankfurters and chicken wontons.</p><p>As midnight approaches, an Applebee’s employee escorts guests to a reserved section of the street for a traditional ball-drop view.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“It definitely was a special menu,” Mr. Lund said. “It seemed to be a little bit better quality than what would normally be at an Applebee’s.”</p><p>If Italian food sounds more appealing, the <a href="https://www.balldrop.com/new-years-eve-olive-garden-nyc-times-square" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Olive Garden</a> in Times Square hosts an event that includes an open bar and a buffet with pasta, salmon and, yes, unlimited breadsticks (“as available,” the Ball Drop website notes). Tickets, which cost $699, had sold out by Monday evening.</p><p>For a more affordable option, <a href="https://www.balldrop.com/new-years-eve-schnippers-times-square" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Schnipper’s</a>, a fast-casual restaurant on the ground floor of the New York Times building, offers a general admission ticket for $119 that includes burgers, French fries, unlimited beer and wine and a view of the Port Authority Bus Terminal.</p><p>Looking to race friends on arcade motorcycles or shoot some hoops? <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/new-years-eve-at-dave-busters-times-square-2025-tickets-1063738503499?aff=PrekindleWebsite" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dave &amp; Buster’s</a> on West 42nd Street has you covered. Tickets start at just over $147 through Eventbrite.</p><p>This year, Ball Drop is producing roughly 65 parties in New York City, including one at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square, according to Paul Warshaw, one of the company’s founders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Our model has always been trying to provide something for everyone,” Mr. Warshaw said. “We have tickets ranging from $100 to $7,500, depending on the experience.”</p><p>“We’ve worked really closely with the <a href="https://www.timessquarenyc.org/times-square-alliance/about-the-alliance" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Times Square Alliance</a> and N.Y.P.D. to create specific entry points based on the various venues,” he added.</p><p>No matter the venue, Times Square on New Year’s Eve is not for the faint of heart. After ringing in the last two years at Applebee’s, Mr. Lund, who now lives in Port Townsend, Wash., had his fill of buffet appetizers and entrees.</p><p>“There’s a little corner bar up the road,” Mr. Lund said. “That’s where we’re going this year.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emmett Lindner writes about breaking and trending news.
