But the Times investigation found that it had claimed to be running four to six facilities in Europe in its submissions to the Ontario government.</p><p>The misstatement of Therme’s actual experience was first raised in an in-depth audit of the deal by Ontario’s auditor general that was released late last year.</p><p>The Times investigation found that the company had, over the course of several years, presented itself as one and the same as a bigger, older, well-known German firm by the same name that does operate several water parks.</p><p>The two companies both told The Times that they had a “knowledge-sharing agreement.”</p><p>A representative for Therme said that its wording could have been more precise, and that references to its success in Germany were meant to communicate that the plan’s concept had been successful.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Therme’s statements about its experience weighed significantly in Ontario’s decision to grant it the Toronto lease, The Times investigation found. Therme bought one of the German spas late last year.</p><p>“I understand they’re all one company, so one bought the other company,” Mr. Ford said on Wednesday. “So I guess they’re a larger, stronger company, but they’re going to look into this allegation.”</p><p>Therme did not buy the German Therme, they are not one company, and the acquisition of the single German spa happened well after it submitted its bid to the Ontario government and won the lease.</p><p>The project on Toronto’s high-value waterfront has been an ongoing saga for the Ford government, which has faced resistance from local residents who wanted to preserve the space as a public park.</p><p>In October, the province <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-place-spa-deal-1.7511819" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cut down more than 800 trees</a> on the land to prepare it for handing over to Therme. Therme is contractually obligated to begin construction by next spring; it has not yet secured outside financing for the project.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The development has been long criticized by Ontario opposition parties. Marit Stiles, the opposition leader in the Ontario legislature, called for the agreement to be canceled.</p><p>“I think it’s better to get this over with now and cancel the deal, and we’ve been saying that since Day 1,” Ms. Stiles said on Wednesday. She added: “Look, Ontario never asked for this. That land was being put to good public use.”</p><p>Mr. Ford said canceling the contract was not on the table.</p><p>“This is going to be something spectacular at the end of the day,” he said. “It’ll be the No. 1 one tourist attraction, I say in the country, next to Niagara Falls.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matina Stevis-Gridneff is the Canada bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the country.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Santa’s Neighbors Are Annoyed: </strong>A tourist season in Rovaniemi, Finland that stretches from October to March has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/asia/santa-finland-rovaniemi.html">anything but jolly for some residents</a> of the “Official Hometown of Santa Claus.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Orange Skies in Iraq: </strong>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/middleeast/iraq-sandstorm.html">severe sandstorm swept across Iraq</a>, turning the sky a strange orange, reducing visibility and sending several thousand people to emergency rooms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Van Gogh’s Last Painting: </strong>The artist painted his final work, “Tree Roots,” in Auvers-sur-Oise, France.
