The loss of workers has led to a roughly $22 million drop in consumer spending downtown.</p><p>Mr. Buell recalled a recent gathering when he said he took some wealthy investors on a tour of downtown. After three hours of walking, they saw fewer than 50 people. He said the investors had loved the historic buildings and infrastructure but wondered why the streets were so deserted.</p><p>He recalled being asked, “Where is everybody?”</p><p>One simple answer relates to the legislative calendar. Lawmakers hold session from January to June, leaving the city center a bit of a ghost town when they return to their home districts.</p><p>To make the city more appealing year-round, Ms. Hochul plans to set aside $25 million in funding to study how to restore access to the city’s waterfront, which has a massive highway running alongside it.</p><p>“The Hudson River is our greatest natural resource,” said State Senator Pat Fahy, a Democrat who represents the capital. “And we’re completely cut off from it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The bus terminal in Albany is in Liberty Park, nine acres of unsightly concrete sprawl on the city’s eastern edge.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cindy Schultz for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Related progress has been made. Late last year the federal government, after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/business/economy/new-york-chip-research-center.html" title="">a long push</a> from Senator Chuck Schumer, announced it had chosen Albany as the location of an $825 million federally funded semiconductor research facility.</p><p>Mr. Schumer also secured hundreds of millions of dollars to replace the Livingston Avenue Bridge, which carries the only upstate passenger rail line crossing the Hudson River. And the city has plans, albeit slow-rolling ones, to tear down eyesores like its <a href="https://www.wamc.org/news/2024-02-01/central-warehouses-days-as-albanys-worst-eyesore-are-numbered-after-developer-abandons-plans" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dilapidated</a> central warehouse and a couple of vacant housing projects.</p><p>Another urban planning challenge is how to undo at least some of the damage that former Gov. Nelson Rockefeller inflicted on the state capital in the 1960s when he built the enormous <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/07/02/archives/mall-architecture-futuristic-doesnt-work.html" title="">Empire State Plaza</a>, which cut downtown in half and uprooted over 9,000 people from a once-thriving neighborhood that was razed to make way for it. Ms. Hochul’s plan includes $25 million to make the plaza “a more inviting space,” said Mr. Washington, the budget director.</p><p>Mr. Buell, the developer, has his own idea. “It’s a scar, it’s an impediment, it’s a bad decision,” he said of the 98-acre concrete expanse built at a cost of $2 billion. “But those are all looking backwards.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>He called for the state to consider converting the Brutalist glass-and-stone office towers rising up from the plaza to residential use.</p><p>Demand for affordable downtown living space is high. Mr. Buell and two partners built 1,000 apartments in the last few years, and he said they are now fully occupied.</p><p>Mr. Mitzen, the Hattie’s owner, just hopes it won’t take too long for the governor’s plan to put cranes in the sky and work boots on the ground. As with the museum, which was first targeted for a major renovation a quarter century ago, progress in downtown Albany often seems to inch along at a snail’s pace, if it advances at all.</p><p>“Let’s go,” he said. “Let’s not spend two years trying to figure it out.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jay Root is an investigative reporter based in Albany, N.Y., covering the people and events influencing — and influenced by — state and local government.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jay-root">More about Jay Root</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>19</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Albany Is Decaying.
