That’s roughly a quarter of all New York City households that don’t live in public housing or rely on a housing voucher.</p></li><li><p>Only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/nyregion/apartment-vacancy-rate-housing-crisis.html" title="">1.4 percent</a> of New York City apartments were available to rent last year, according to <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/hpd/downloads/pdfs/about/2023-nychvs-selected-initial-findings.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a key city survey</a>.

Scores of buildings were abandoned and in states of disrepair. Today, the city has a different problem, as demand to live in New York City is overwhelming its housing stock, leading to soaring rents and gentrification. How did we get here?</p><p>New York City bounced back and became a very attractive place to live, with good jobs, cultural amenities and public transit. But housing growth has lagged behind job growth and population growth over the last few decades, making the limited housing options ever more expensive.</p><p>The crunch is hitting working families hard. I asked the Service Employees International Union how it is affecting its members. Rosanna Glasgow, 37, who earns $19 an hour working in the security line at Kennedy International Airport, lives with her mother and her brother, a welder, in the Rockaways in Queens. They pay $2,600 a month for a three-bedroom apartment.</p><p>The heat doesn’t work in their building, and they can’t get the landlord to make repairs, Glasgow said. To end a dispute with the landlord, she agreed to move out by next February. She has been looking for months for a place to move but cannot find any comparable apartments that cost less than $3,600.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I don’t know what’s going to happen,” she said.</p><h2 id="link-64253f31">The meaning of ‘affordable’</h2><p>The government considers an apartment to be affordable when the rent is less than <a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/affordable_housing_barriers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">30 percent</a> of the renter’s gross income. That is not the same as “affordable housing,” which mostly refers to housing that is subsidized by the government and is typically aimed at people with low and middle incomes.</p><p>Sometimes the subsidy is money a developer receives directly or in the form of a tax break in exchange for making some units affordable for people at specified income levels.</p><p>Let’s say your family is the typical New York City renter household, earning about $70,000 a year. Most market-rate rents are too high, so a savvy first step is to check the city website for affordable apartments, known as <a href="https://housingconnect.nyc.gov/PublicWeb/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Housing Connect</a>.</p><p>One of the first developments listed is <a href="https://housingconnect.nyc.gov/PublicWeb/details/5382" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lumen LIC</a>, which is expected to open in the spring. It’s in Long Island City in Queens, near eight subway lines, and has about 280 apartments listed as affordable housing.</p><p>How affordable, you wonder? The two-bedroom apartments — ideal for you, your partner and your child — cost $4,434 a month, meaning you would be spending at least half of your income on housing. Maybe you can squeeze everyone into a one-bedroom? Most cost $3,695 a month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>These apartments are not affordable to you or most renters. This is common in New York City. In fact, it’s probably true for most of the “affordable housing” units built over <a href="https://furmancenter.org/files/publications/The_Role_of_421-a_Final.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">much of the past decade</a>. How and why did this happen?</p><h2 id="link-cb769ff">How does the government decide the rent?</h2><p>This is probably the most technical part, so bear with me.</p><p>Nearly every affordable housing program relies on something called the “<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-and-information/area-median-income.page" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Area Median Income,</a>” or the A.M.I., to set rents.</p><p>Using the A.M.I. helps ensure that affordable housing goes to the people who need it most. A program designed to subsidize apartments for low-income people, for example, might say those homes can only go to people who make up to 60 percent of the A.M.I.</p><p>Here’s the problem: In New York City, the A.M.I. has little to do with people’s actual incomes. Put as simply as possible, the pricey rents in New York City <a href="https://anhd.org/report/new-york-citys-ami-problem-and-housing-we-actually-need" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trigger a federal scheme</a> called the “<a href="https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/affordable-for-whom-comparing-affordability-levels-of-the-mayors-housing-new-york-plan-with-neighborhood-incomes-february-2019.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">high housing cost adjustment,</a>” so the A.M.I. is calculated based on rents, not incomes.</p><p>The goal is to allow <em>more</em> people to qualify for affordable housing programs, though that can be counterintuitive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Imagine for a moment that the A.M.I. was actually the same as New York City’s <a href="https://data.census.gov/profile/New_York_city,_New_York?g=160XX00US3651000" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">median household income</a> of $77,000. Half of the city’s households would qualify for an affordable apartment restricted to those who make up to that amount.</p><p>But the adjusted A.M.I. in 2024 in New York City is $139,800 for a family of three — almost double the actual median. Many more households earn up to that limit, so more people qualify for the affordable apartment.</p><p>The consequence, though, is that the rent considered to be “affordable” also goes up. Now, $3,495 for a two-bedroom counts as affordable for anyone who makes up to the A.M.I. Even if you earn less than $139,800, the rent you have to pay for this “affordable” apartment is the same.</p><p>Sometimes affordable housing programs set rents that are a little more realistic for lower-income households. But some programs also raise the bar, offering rents based on 130 percent of the A.M.I., or more than $180,000 for a family of three.</p><p>In practice, it can make “affordable housing” seem laughably out of whack with what the average person can actually afford.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-6163a621">The philosophical juggling act</h2><p>It may seem that this is a problem of semantics. But the terms we use to think about affordability matter, especially when politicians create policies designed to address the overall issue.</p><p>One takeaway: What people might actually consider affordable is relative. Cheap rents farther out from business districts or the city core and its subway lines may also mean higher transportation expenses if you end up needing a car.</p><p>Someone with a high income and no student loans may be able to easily spend 50 percent of their earnings on rent. Another person who has to be a caretaker for a sick family member might find it difficult to spend even 30 percent of their income on housing.</p><p>The term “affordable housing” fails to take into account all these nuances. That makes solving New York City’s housing crisis all the more difficult.</p><p>Throughout this series, we’ll return to these issues from different vantage points in a way that will aim to give you an understanding that is as nuanced and layered as the crisis itself.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mayor Eric Adams’s housing proposal known as City of Yes would eliminate parking requirements for new developments.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karsten Moran for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-783cf870">What we’re reading 🔗</h2><ul><li><p>President-elect Donald J.
