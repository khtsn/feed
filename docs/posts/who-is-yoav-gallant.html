Mr. Gallant repeatedly broke with Mr. Netanyahu and urged him to reach a deal to free the remaining hostages in Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In August, the defense minister <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/world/middleeast/netanyahu-gallant-gaza-total-victory.html" title="">questioned</a> the Israeli leader’s goal of “total victory” over Hamas in Gaza, calling it “nonsense.”</p><p>The defense minister also suggested that Mr. Netanyahu was letting Israel slide toward long-term military rule in Gaza — a choice that Mr. Gallant said would be disastrous.</p><p>Mr. Katz, an ally of the prime minister, is unlikely to stand in the way of Mr. Netanyahu’s approach to cease-fire talks, which critics say have undermined the possibility of a deal.</p><p>Even before the war in Gaza, Mr. Gallant had repeatedly clashed with Mr. Netanyahu over the prime minister’s hotly contested plans to weaken the country’s judicial system.</p><p>Amid widespread street protests, in March 2023, after Mr. Gallant gave a speech warning that the proposals were tearing the country apart, Mr. Netanyahu sought to fire him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>That <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/10/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-gallant.html" title="">attempted dismissal</a> roiled the country further, prompting mass protests and a general strike. Mr. Netanyahu ultimately backed down and walked back his decision to oust Mr. Gallant.</p><h2 id="link-1e4dd3bc">Political and family background</h2><p>Before entering politics, Mr. Gallant, 65, served as a senior general who led the Israeli military’s southern command, which oversees Gaza. In 2010, he was tapped to potentially serve as the military’s chief of staff, but the appointment never came to pass.</p><p>Mr. Gallant joined the Israel Defense Forces in 1974 and served in a commando unit before holding various leadership roles over a 35-year military career.</p><p>After leaving the military, Mr. Gallant entered politics, first with a centrist party before switching over to Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud faction. In 2022, about a dozen years after his failed bid to become chief of staff, he became defense minister in Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing government, taking him to the apex of the Israeli security establishment</p><p>Mr. Gallant studied economics and business administration at the University of Haifa and completed a senior management program at Harvard University, according to his Ministry of Defense <a href="https://english.mod.gov.il/Minister_of_Defense/Pages/Minister-of-Defense.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">profile</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He lives in Moshav Amikam and is married to Claudine Gallant, with whom he has three children.</p><h2 id="link-6fc51167">Response to Gallant’s firing</h2><p>In a televised speech on Tuesday, Mr. Gallant blamed his dismissal on disagreements with Mr. Netanyahu over three issues.</p><p>Mr. Gallant said the two differed over:</p><ul><li><p>The proposed mandatory conscription of ultra-Orthodox Israelis.</p></li><li><p>A cease-fire deal in Gaza that would secure the release of hostages held there.</p></li><li><p>And Mr. Gallant’s insistence on an independent commission to investigate the security failures that led to the Oct. 7 attacks.</p></li></ul><p>“I’ve been responsible for the security apparatus during the past two years, its successes, failures, and moments of pain,” Mr. Gallant said of his call for an investigative commission. “Only sunlight, and an investigation of the truth, would allow us to draw lessons and build our forces to face the challenges of the future.”</p><p>Late on Tuesday, large crowds of protesters opposing Mr. Netanyahu’s firing of the defense minister took to city streets. They blocked traffic and lit bonfires on a major highway in Tel Aviv.</p><p>In Jerusalem, protesters also gathered near the Mr. Netanyahu’s residence.</p><p>Johnatan Reiss<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eve Sampson is a reporter covering international news and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eve-sampson">More about Eve Sampson</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/yoav-gallant">Yoav Gallant</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hamas">Hamas</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/likud-party-israel">Likud Party (Israel)</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">The Israel Hamas War</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Netanyahu and Gallant’s Disagreements:</strong><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/world/middleeast/israel-yoav-gallant.html">Yoav Gallant, the ousted cabinet minister</a>, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/world/middleeast/netanyahu-gallant-israel.html">sharp public disagreements</a> over Israel’s war against Hamas and what will follow it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Biden Officials Struggle With Lebanon:</strong><strong> </strong>Despite hopes that political shifts in Beirut could bring lasting peace to the Israel-Lebanon border, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/biden-lebanon-israel-iran.html">the United States may have to settle for a quicker fix</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Elections:</strong><strong> </strong>Gazans fear <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/world/middleeast/gaza-us-election-harris-trump.html">neither candidate in the U.S. election will help them</a>.
