                  <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/9565/vitality" data-tooltip-id="uid1970396943">Vitality</a> are through to the PGL Cluj-Napoca semi-finals after a resounding first-round playoff victory over <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/11861/aurora" data-tooltip-id="uid234726945">Aurora</a>. &#34;We showed our A game even though we had a lot of people sick,&#34; <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/16693/flamez" data-tooltip-id="uid1356066809">Shahar <span>&#34;⁠flameZ⁠&#34;</span> Shushan</a>, the second-highest rated player for <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/9565/vitality" data-tooltip-id="uid1970396943">Vitality</a> in the series, said on the broadcast after the match.</p>
                  <p>&#34;No one played for three days, so we needed to get back into things,&#34; he added, &#34;but we&#39;re very confident going into the semis. Most of the time, if we play our A game, it&#39;s gonna be a trophy in the bag.&#34;</p>
                  <p>The series kicked off on Inferno, where <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/11816/ropz" data-tooltip-id="uid775901756">Robin <span>&#34;⁠ropz⁠&#34;</span> Kool</a> was the pointman for <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/9565/vitality" data-tooltip-id="uid1970396943">Vitality</a> on the CT side. With <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/11861/aurora" data-tooltip-id="uid234726945">Aurora</a> gunning to make it even at the half, the Estonian&#39;s best play came in the final round of the half, when he single-handedly turned a 2v4 situation with four kills to keep his team in the lead at the switch, 7-5.</p>
                  <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/11893/zywoo" data-tooltip-id="uid1000143207">Mathieu <span>&#34;⁠ZywOo⁠&#34;</span> Herbaut</a>, who didn&#39;t have much impact in the first half, came alive on the attack, with 13 kills, 130 ADR, and +12.47% swing to lead <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/9565/vitality" data-tooltip-id="uid1970396943">Vitality</a> to a 13-8 victory on <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/11861/aurora" data-tooltip-id="uid234726945">Aurora</a>&#39;s map pick.</p>
                  
                  <p>The series moved to Overpass, and the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/11893/zywoo" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1000143207">ZywOo</a> show continued as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/9565/vitality" data-tooltip-id="uid1970396943">Vitality</a>&#39;s star went 16-0 in the first eight rounds of play with around 200 ADR before <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/20968/soulfly" data-tooltip-id="uid1555402058">Caner <span>&#34;⁠soulfly⁠&#34;</span> Kesici</a> managed to kill him for the first time. And it wasn&#39;t until the following round that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/11861/aurora" data-tooltip-id="uid234726945">Aurora</a> put together a successful defense in what was quickly looking like a lost cause.</p>
                  <p>Trailing by six after the two-man show put together by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/11893/zywoo" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1000143207">ZywOo</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/16693/flamez" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1356066809">flameZ</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/11861/aurora" data-tooltip-id="uid234726945">Aurora</a> won the second pistol round, but <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/9565/vitality" data-tooltip-id="uid1970396943">Vitality</a> hit right back by winning the forcebuy. The Turks didn&#39;t give up, and finally put up some resistance, winning four in a row until a botched A hit against a forcebuy put <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/9565/vitality" data-tooltip-id="uid1970396943">Vitality</a> up 12-8.</p>
                  <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/11861/aurora" data-tooltip-id="uid234726945">Aurora</a> were not going to go gently into that good night, however, and a double entry by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/7938/xantares" data-tooltip-id="uid1241519193">Ismailcan <span>&#34;⁠XANTARES⁠&#34;</span> Dörtkardeş</a> in the 22nd round put his team on double digits and within range of the comeback.</p>
                  <p>Who else but <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/11893/zywoo" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1000143207">ZywOo</a>, who had gone somewhat quiet on the CT side after his heroic T side, was the one to put an end to it, clutching out a 1v2 to secure the victory for <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/9565/vitality" data-tooltip-id="uid1970396943">Vitality</a>.</p>
                  
                  <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/11861/aurora" data-tooltip-id="uid234726945">Aurora</a>&#39;s journey in Cluj-Napoca is now over, while <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/9565/vitality" data-tooltip-id="uid1970396943">Vitality</a>&#39;s next rival will come from the final game of the quarter-finals, pitting <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/6248/the-mongolz" data-tooltip-id="uid1120534418">The MongolZ</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/8297/furia" data-tooltip-id="uid1159110064">FURIA</a>.</p>
                  <p>This match also helps <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/11893/zywoo" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1000143207">ZywOo</a> cement his spot at the top of the stats leaderboard, which he is spearheading with a 1.44 rating, .11 above the eliminated <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/19230/m0nesy" data-tooltip-id="uid1641256717">Ilya <span>&#34;⁠m0NESY⁠&#34;</span> Osipov</a> and .20 ahead of his teammate <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/16693/flamez" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1356066809">flameZ</a>.</p>
