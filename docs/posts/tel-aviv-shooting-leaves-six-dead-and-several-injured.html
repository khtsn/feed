No group immediately claimed responsibility for the shooting.</p><p>Shortly after the attack, Israel’s air defense system intercepted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah" title="">a swarm of Iranian missiles over Tel Aviv</a>. Loud booms and bright explosions filled the sky as residents sought shelter.</p><p>“The police forces are handling the scene under a missile attack,” the police said in a statement about the shooting. “The event is under control.”</p><p>The shooting took place a day after Israel invaded Lebanon, where Israeli forces have recently led a series of punishing strikes on Hezbollah, the armed Lebanese militia and proxy to Iran. Haim Sargarov, the police commander of the Tel Aviv district, told reporters that the gunmen were “not Israelis.” (The police in Israel almost exclusively use the word “terrorism” to describe attacks carried out by Palestinian militants.)</p><p>The shooting occurred on Jerusalem Boulevard, a major tree-lined thoroughfare and important public transportation route in the city’s Jaffa neighborhood. Israel’s emergency service agency, Magen David Adom, said it was treating the injured. </p><p>Nadav Matzner, a spokesman for the group, said six of the 12 people who were injured in the attack were severely wounded.</p><p>Images broadcast on Israeli television showed two gunmen in street clothes carrying large rifles. Video shared widely online showed injured people lying on the sidewalk on Jerusalem Boulevard.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Videos verified by The New York Times showed the aftermath of the shooting at the Ehrlich light rail station in Jaffa. Three motionless bodies were seen lying on the street. Two armed men were captured earlier in surveillance footage exiting a train at the station.</p><p>Yosef Kurdi, a medic with Magen David Adom, said in a statement provided by the group that when he arrived at the scene there were people with gunshot wounds lying near the railroad tracks, outside a nearby kiosk and in a synagogue down the street.</p><p>Another medic, Israel Rost, said he treated three wounded victims — one in a synagogue, one in a butcher shop and one lying on the street — and that some of the victims had suffered stab wounds.</p><p>Recent incidents have brought Israel’s conflicts creeping ever closer to Tel Aviv, a city that often feels physically and psychologically removed from the violence.</p><p>The shooting came after several attempted aerial attacks on Tel Aviv by Iran-backed forces in Lebanon and Yemen, and six weeks after Hamas and Islamic Jihad took responsibility for what the groups said was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/world/middleeast/tel-aviv-bomb-hamas.html" title="">suicide bombing</a> in Tel Aviv.</p><p>The Israeli police did not describe that incident as a suicide bombing, but if it were it would be the first suicide attack in the city since 2016. At that time, Hamas and Islamic Jihad had threatened attacks in response to the “continued civilian displacement and killings” of Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>The shooting on Tuesday took place shortly after Tel Aviv residents were advised by Israel’s Home Front Command to stay close to bomb shelters and to avoid any unnecessary travel or outdoor activities.
