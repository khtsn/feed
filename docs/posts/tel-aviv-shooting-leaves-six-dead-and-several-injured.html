    <h1>Tel Aviv Shooting Leaves Six Dead and Several Injured</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Videos verified by The New York Times showed the aftermath of the shooting at the Ehrlich light rail station in Jaffa. Three motionless bodies were seen lying on the street. Two armed men were captured earlier in surveillance footage exiting a train at the station.</p><p>A bystander’s video captured a gunman firing what appeared to be at least 16 shots at the station. A train pulled out of the station while he fired. Another man walks beside him, though it’s unclear if he’s carrying a firearm.</p><p>Eran Nissan, 33, had left his home in Jaffa with his partner to buy groceries in advance of the expected Iranian missile attack. As they stood in line at the checkout, they heard volleys of gunshots begin to ring out.</p><p>Mr. Nissan, a trained paramedic who volunteers with Magen David Adom, said he ran across the street to a butcher shop. A young woman lay on the ground with a wounded hand; he began to bind her wound with a tourniquet he had kept in his bag.</p><p>More gunshots rang out, this time even closer, Mr. Nissan recalled, leading them to shut and barricade the door.</p><p>“Other people were hiding there with us — both Arabs and Jews,” said Mr. Nissan.</p><p>After loading the injured woman into an ambulance, he headed home. Almost as soon as arriving, air-raid sirens began to ring out throughout the country, warning of the impending Iranian ballistic missile barrage.</p><p>Yosef Kurdi, a medic with Magen David Adom, said in a statement provided by the agency that when he arrived at the scene there were people with gunshot wounds lying near the railroad tracks, outside a nearby kiosk and in a synagogue down the street.</p><p>Recent incidents have brought Israel’s conflicts ever closer to Tel Aviv. </p><p>The shooting came after several attempted aerial attacks on the city by Iran-backed forces in Lebanon and Yemen, and six weeks after Hamas and Islamic Jihad took responsibility for what the groups said was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/world/middleeast/tel-aviv-bomb-hamas.html" title="">suicide bombing</a> in Tel Aviv in August.</p><p>The Israeli police did not describe that incident as a suicide bombing, but if so, it would have been the first suicide attack in the city since 2016. At the time of that August attack, Hamas and Islamic Jihad had threatened attacks in response to the “continued civilian displacement and killings” of Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>The shooting on Tuesday took place shortly after Tel Aviv residents had been advised by Israel’s Home Front Command to stay close to bomb shelters and to avoid any unnecessary travel or outdoor activities. The streets of the city <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah/here-are-the-latest-developments?smid=url-share" title="">were quickly emptied in anticipation of the Iranian missile strike</a>.</p><p>Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div>
