He also ordered <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/reevaluating-and-realigning-united-states-foreign-aid/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 90-day freeze</a> on all foreign aid spending to review it for any conflicts with his priorities, making exceptions for military assistance to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/us/politics/us-foreign-aid-egypt-israel.html" title="">Israel and Egypt</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>That freeze has jeopardized a broad swath of congressionally authorized aid, like military assistance to Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s invasion, helping pay the salaries of a Kurdish-led militia guarding Islamic State detainees in northeast Syria and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/health/pepfar-trump-freeze.html" title="">distribution of anti-H.I.V. medication in Africa and developing countries</a>.</p><p>By the start of his second week, Mr. Trump signaled an escalation. On Monday, the White House, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/27/us/omb-memo.html" title="">in a memo</a>, ordered a temporary halt to “all federal financial assistance” like loans and grants on domestic soil as well. While Social Security and Medicare were exempted, the memo said it would apply to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/white-house-pauses-federal-grants.html" title="">as much as $3 trillion in government programs and activities</a>.</p><p>Should the freeze become permanent for a program that Congress approved but the White House does not like, it could set off a court fight over the constitutionality of a law banning unilateral “impoundment” by presidents.</p><h2 id="link-3cb7a321">What is impoundment?</h2><p>It is the act by a president to withhold or delay the spending of funds that Congress has appropriated for the federal government to disburse.</p><p>While it is routine for the executive branch to hold back some authorized spending if it is able to come in under budget while still accomplishing Congress’s goal, the practice becomes contentious when a president refuses to spend money Congress has appropriated for a program because he objects to it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Congress essentially banned presidents from unilaterally and permanently impounding funds in a 1974 law. But during the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump, <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-using-impoundment-to-cut-waste-stop-inflation-and-crush-the-deep-state" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a video</a> on his campaign website, vowed to restore the power so that he could “squeeze the bloated federal bureaucracy for massive savings.”</p><h2 id="link-5c797a79">What would impoundment mean for presidential power?</h2><p>Legalizing permanent impoundment would transfer power from Congress to the presidency.</p><p>The founders devised the separation of powers to keep each branch from accumulating too much authority and posing a threat to liberty. Central to that is Congress’s control of decisions about taxation and spending — its power of the purse.</p><p>In the Federalist Papers, <a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed58.asp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">James Madison wrote</a> that this power was a “most complete and effectual weapon” for elected lawmakers to wield.</p><p>But supporters of concentrating more power in the presidency argue that the Constitution gives the president the authority to choose not to execute particular spending provisions Congress has written into the law. They say the phrase “the president shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed” should be interpreted to allow for that.</p><h2 id="link-6c76f453">What would impoundment mean for spending cuts?</h2><p>Permanent impoundment would make it easier to restrain federal spending.</p><p>In an era of persistent budget deficits and mounting federal debt, people who think the government spends too much have grown frustrated with Congress’s record and sought ways to expand presidential power to cancel some of lawmakers’ spending decisions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In 1996, for example, Congress passed a law that would allow presidents to veto specific line items in spending bills, rather than having to accept or veto the entire legislative package. But the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1997/97-1374" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">struck down that law as unconstitutional</a>.</p><p>Impoundment would be another way of essentially doing the same thing — if it is lawful.</p><h2 id="link-4d03ee50">Is unilateral and permanent impoundment lawful?</h2><p>Not under current federal law, with narrow exceptions.</p><p>There are rare examples of presidents impounding funds for certain programs dating to the early 19th century. But the practice became more common during the 20th century, especially with vast spending during the Cold War era on weapons and disputes between presidents and Congress over which to buy.</p><p>The practice peaked under Nixon, who impounded billions lawmakers had appropriated for matters like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/03/archives/fund-impounding-in-missouri-upset-court-asks-administration-be.html" title="">highway spending</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/11/archives/nixon-impounds-pollution-funds-withholds-3billion-allocated-for.html" title="">pollution control</a>. In response, Congress in 1974 sought to restore its power of the purse by enacting a law called the Impoundment Control Act.</p><p>The statute outlawed the ability of presidents to unilaterally and permanently rescind congressional funding decisions. Instead, it set up a narrow procedure by which presidents could submit proposed cuts to Congress for approval. Without it, the funds eventually had to be spent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The rules are looser for spending deferrals, or temporary blocks on funds that will eventually be released. Another part of the statute, as <a href="https://www.congress.gov/100/statute/STATUTE-101/STATUTE-101-Pg754.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">amended in 1987</a> by Congress, says the president is supposed to send lawmakers a detailed and specific notice about such a delay, including its rationale and when it will be over.</p><p>While the Trump White House publicly disclosed the “temporary” freezes in broad strokes in an executive order and the memo, it is not clear whether it sent any such notice to Congress.</p><h2 id="link-3df2fb7a">What is Trump’s intent?</h2><p>There are reasons to believe that the president wants a legal confrontation over the legality of permanent impoundment, although the current freeze is not yet ripe for that.</p><p>The administration has pushed back against dismayed reactions to its freeze. A senior administration official disputed that the halt violated the Impoundment Control Act, portraying the pause as merely allowing time for a review to be conducted. Funding for programs that do not conflict with the administration’s policies will eventually resume, the official added.</p><p>But that does not address what will happen to funds for programs that the administration determines are out of step with its priorities. <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-using-impoundment-to-cut-waste-stop-inflation-and-crush-the-deep-state" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Trump campaign said explicitly</a> that the president intended to challenge the constitutionality of the 1974 law restricting presidential impoundment power.</p><p>The campaign said he planned to direct agencies “on Day 1” to “identify portions of their budgets where massive savings are possible through the impoundment power.” And in the accompanying video, Mr. Trump said, “When I return to the White House, I will do everything I can to challenge the Impoundment Control Act in court, and if necessary, get Congress to overturn it.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Charlie Savage writes about national security and legal policy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/charlie-savage">More about Charlie Savage</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-supreme-court">U.S. Supreme Court</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/james-madison">James Madison</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/richard-milhous-nixon">Richard Milhous Nixon</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-house-of-representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The First 100 Days of the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Military Changes:</strong> President Trump moved toward pushing openly transgender people out of the military and directed the Pentagon to end diversity programs as he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-military-transgender-dei-orders.html">sought to reshape America’s armed forces</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Firing Prosecutors:</strong> The acting attorney general <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/justice-department-firings-trump-jack-smith.html">fired more than a dozen prosecutors</a> who worked on the investigations into Trump for the special counsel Jack Smith, saying they could not be trusted to “faithfully implement” the president’s agenda.</p></li><li><p><strong>Immigration:</strong> When Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, refused military planes carrying deportees, infuriating Trump, he revealed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/world/americas/colombia-trump-deportation-flights-migrants.html">how heated the question of deportations has become</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Health:</strong> Conservative Christian moms believe in home-schooling and distrust food and drug companies.
