He also ordered <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/reevaluating-and-realigning-united-states-foreign-aid/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 90-day freeze</a> on all foreign aid spending to review it for any conflicts with his priorities, making exceptions for military assistance to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/us/politics/us-foreign-aid-egypt-israel.html" title="">Israel and Egypt</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>That freeze has jeopardized a broad swath of congressionally authorized aid, like military assistance to Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s invasion, helping pay the salaries of a Kurdish-led militia guarding Islamic State detainees in northeast Syria and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/health/pepfar-trump-freeze.html" title="">distribution of anti-H.I.V. medication in Africa and developing countries</a>.</p><p>By the start of his second week, Mr. Trump signaled an escalation. On Monday, the White House, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/27/us/omb-memo.html" title="">in a memo</a>, ordered a temporary halt to “all federal financial assistance” like loans and grants on domestic soil as well. While Social Security and Medicare were exempted, the memo said it would apply to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/white-house-pauses-federal-grants.html" title="">as much as $3 trillion in government programs and activities</a>.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
