Mr. Trump has said that he planned to speak to Mr. Putin directly this week.</p><p>“After we receive this information — not through the press but through bilateral dialogue — then the time will come for thinking it over and formulating a position,” Mr. Peskov said.</p><p>Also on Thursday, Mr. Putin is expected to meet the authoritarian president of neighboring Belarus, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko. The two close allies will hold a news conference in which Mr. Putin could make his first public remarks about the 30-day cease-fire offer, Tass, Russia’s state news agency, <a href="https://tass.ru/politika/23381323" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p><p>The flurry of diplomacy came as Moscow’s forces intensified a campaign to push Ukrainian forces out of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/world/europe/putin-kursk-ukraine.html" title="">Kursk region of Russia</a>, the border area where Kyiv’s troops occupied several hundred square miles of territory in a surprise incursion last August. </p></div></div>
