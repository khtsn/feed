The announcement comes about 15 months after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/16/arts/design/british-museum-theft.html" title="">the museum fired a curator whom it has accused of stealing</a> from its storerooms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>This is not the first billion-dollar gift to a Western institution. In 1991, Walter H. Annenberg, a publisher and philanthropist, announced he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/12/arts/annenberg-picks-met-for-1-billion-gift.html" title="">donate his $1 billion collection of paintings</a>, including works by Manet, van Gogh and Picasso, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. In 2013, the cosmetics tycoon Leonard A. Lauder <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/arts/design/leonard-lauder-is-giving-his-cubist-collection-to-the-met.html" title="">promised the Met his collection of Cubist artworks</a>, including 33 Picassos, that was then thought to be worth more than $1 billion.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Since 2009, the Sir Percival David Foundation had lent the collection — including a wine cup thought to have been used by the Chenghua emperor of the Ming dynasty — to the museum, where it is displayed in a dedicated gallery.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The Trustees of the British Museum</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But such a large donation of objects is rarer for museums in Britain. Two years ago, the British Museum announced “one of the most significant” bequests in its history when a former trustee <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/sites/default/files/2022-08/bequest_sir_joseph_hotung_press_release.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">left the institution his collection of Chinese artworks</a>, including several hundred jades. This year, the museum <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66ad0064a3c2a28abb50dc6e/British_Museum_Annual_Report_and_Accounts_2023_to_204.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">revealed in its annual report</a> that the donation was worth £123 million, or $156 million.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/12/arts/antiques-basins-and-bowls-from-the-palaces-of-imperial-china.html" title="">Sir Percival was born in 1892</a>, in what is now Mumbai, India, to a Jewish family of businessmen with distant links to Iran. An heir to the Sassoon textile and banking fortune, Sir Percival moved to England in 1913; after buying three Chinese ceramics he soon became a passionate collector.</p><p>In 1924, he traveled to Beijing for the first time to view the Imperial collection. Finding much of it stored in boxes, he paid for the restoration of a building to display the treasures. Three years later, he became an adviser to China’s National Palace Museums.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Jessica Harrison-Hall, the British Museum’s curator of the Sir Percival David Collections, said in an interview that he was a “remarkable man” dedicated to Chinese culture whose obsessions went beyond collecting to include the translation of 14th-century texts.</p><p>Sir Percival, Harrison-Hall said, was not a “stamp collector” who simply looked to acquire a handful of emblematic pieces. Instead, he sought to amass a collection that could be used by scholars, including multiple examples of some works. “You simply couldn’t build up a collection like this today,” she said.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
