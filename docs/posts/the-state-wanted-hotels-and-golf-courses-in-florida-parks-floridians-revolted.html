Ron DeSantis.</p><p>The plan, <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/2024/08/20/are-changes-coming-floridas-state-park-system/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shared with The Tampa Bay Times through intermediaries</a>, prompted a series of grass-roots protests across the state as Floridians demanded that the parks be kept intact. Republican leaders from Washington to the state capital, Tallahassee, including some of the governor’s stalwart allies, were among those questioning the plan, calling it an affront to long-held bipartisan conservation efforts in Florida.</p><p>James Gaddis, a cartographer for the state’s Department of Environmental Protection who leaked the plan, said in an interview that he had been asked to draw up conceptual land use maps that would have destroyed environmentally sensitive lands and imperiled plant and animal species.</p><p>The DeSantis administration initially defended the plan, which it called the “Great Outdoors Initiative,” as a way “to expand public access, increase outdoor activities and provide new lodging options across Florida’s state parks.” It announced a vague version of the plan on Aug. 19 — a day before a story with more details, based on the leak, appeared in The Tampa Bay Times.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But, faced with an unrelenting wave of opposition, Mr. DeSantis shelved it last week, a rare policy setback for a governor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/28/us/politics/ron-desantis-florida-politics.html" title="">used to getting his way</a>. It was the kind of bruising moment that some in Tallahassee think Mr. DeSantis could face more often after his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/us/politics/desantis-drops-out.html" title="">failed</a> campaign for the Republican presidential nomination <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/08/us/desantis-florida-legislature.html" title="">left him politically weakened</a>.</p><p>“They’re going back to the drawing board,” Mr. DeSantis said at a public event on Aug. 28, adding that the plan was “half-baked and not ready for prime time.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>James Gaddis said in an interview that he had been asked to draw up conceptual land use maps that would have destroyed environmentally sensitive lands and imperiled plant and animal species in state parks.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Wallheiser for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>By Saturday, Mr. Gaddis had been fired. On Monday, he opened a GoFundMe account disclosing his identity as the leaker and trying to raise $10,000 to help with his sudden unemployment. By Thursday, he had raised more than $211,000.</p><p>In an interview, Mr. Gaddis called the outpouring “overwhelming” after losing a “dream job.”</p><p>In response to a request for comment about Mr. Gaddis’s firing, the state provided a copy of his termination letter. It said he was being fired over “conduct unbecoming a public employee, violation of law or department rules, negligence and misconduct.” A spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Department declined further comment on “personnel matters.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. DeSantis said the leak had gone to an unnamed “left-wing group,” which Mr. Gaddis denied. He declined to say exactly to whom he had leaked the information.</p><p>Mr. Gaddis said he had just finished a shift at his second job, stocking shelves at a store in Tallahassee, when he received the termination letter on Saturday. It hurt, he said, but he was buoyed by the broad opposition to the plan and the support for his actions.</p><p>“Seeing a lot of bipartisanship in the state of Florida,” he added, “was just awesome.”</p><p>Before Mr. DeSantis <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/us/politics/ron-desantis-2024-presidential-election.html" title="">joined the presidential race</a> last year, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/05/us/ron-desantis-florida-legislature.html" title="">appeared unstoppable</a>. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/08/us/politics/desantis-wins-florida-governor.html" title="">had been re-elected</a> by 19 percentage points in 2022 after his meteoric rise as a darling of the political right during the divisive culture wars that dominated the coronavirus pandemic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Among the proposals were three golf courses at Jonathan Dickinson State Park in Martin County.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Crystal Vander Weit/TCPalm, via Usa Today</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>But he ended his campaign in January after placing a distant second to former President Donald J.

Mr. DeSantis has vowed to defeat both of the questions, which would need more than 60 percent approval to succeed.</p><p>Nikki Fried, the chairwoman of the Florida Democratic Party, said that Floridians were tired of being “lab rats” for right-wing policies. “Voters are rejecting extremism,” she said last week. On Thursday, several Democratic members of Congress from Florida urged the governor to release all public records regarding the parks plan.</p><p>More striking, however, was the Republican pushback against Mr. DeSantis over the plan.</p><p>Among its proposals were a disc golf course, up to four pickleball courts and 10 cabins at Oleta River State Park in Miami-Dade County; three golf courses at Jonathan Dickinson State Park in Martin County; and a 350-room lodge at Anastasia State Park in St. Johns County.</p><p>Early on, a spokesman for Mr. DeSantis defended the plan. “It’s high time we made public lands more accessible to the public,” Jeremy Redfern, the spokesman, said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>To move the proposals forward, the Environmental Protection Department had planned to hold public meetings around the state on Aug. 27 that would each last one hour.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Faced with an unrelenting wave of opposition, Gov.

A protest at Oleta River State Park in North Miami Beach was organized in part by a home-schooling mother who <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/florida-parks-initiative-draws-criticism-planned-protests/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told CBS Miami</a> that she frequently takes her children there.</p><p>Outside the Environmental Protection Department’s headquarters in Tallahassee, where about 150 protesters gathered on Aug. 27, Cris Costello, senior organizing manager for Sierra Club Florida, said pickleball and golf belonged in local parks, not state parks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators protested at Oleta River State Park, in North Miami Beach, Fla., in August.

But his passions were geography and history, and he jumped at the chance to become a parks cartographer. The job, which he held for about two years, paid about $49,300 a year.</p><p>On his GoFundMe page, donors praised Mr. Gaddis for what he did.
