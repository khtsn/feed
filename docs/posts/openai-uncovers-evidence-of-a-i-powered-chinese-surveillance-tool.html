    <h1>OpenAI Uncovers Evidence of A.I.-Powered Chinese Surveillance Tool</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There have been growing concerns that A.I. can be used for surveillance, computer hacking, disinformation campaigns and other malicious purposes. Though researchers like Mr. Nimmo say the technology can certainly enable these kinds of activities, they add that A.I. can also help identify and stop such behavior.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ben Nimmo, a principal investigator for OpenAI.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alexander Coggin For The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Nimmo and his team believe the Chinese surveillance tool is based on Llama, an A.I. technology built by Meta, which open sourced its technology, meaning it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/18/technology/ai-meta-open-source.html" title="">shared its work with software developers across the globe</a>.</p><p>In a detailed report on the use of A.I. for malicious and deceptive purposes, OpenAI also said it had uncovered a separate Chinese campaign, called Sponsored Discontent, that used OpenAI’s technologies to generate English-language posts that criticized Chinese dissidents.</p><p>The same group, OpenAI said, has used the company’s technologies to translate articles into Spanish before distributing them in Latin America. The articles criticized U.S. society and politics.</p></div></div>
