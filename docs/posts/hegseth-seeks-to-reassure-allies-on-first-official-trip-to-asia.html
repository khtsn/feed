Tomorrow, it’s Japan. It will be Australia and South Korea and other nations in this part of the world,” he said, where, together, “we will establish the deterrence necessary to prevent war.”</p><p>The Philippines was the first stop of Mr. Hegseth’s tour of Asia, which will also include Japan; both countries have mutual defense treaties with the United States. But they and others in the region have been anxiously watching President Trump call into question the United States’ decades-old alliances in North America and Europe.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Philippines has been involved in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/world/asia/us-trump-philippines-china.html" title="">increasingly tense standoffs</a> with China in the South China Sea over Beijing’s expansive territorial claims. Japan also has protested <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/world/asia/trump-china-japan-korea.html" title="">repeated Chinese incursions</a> into waters near disputed islands in the East China Sea.</p><p>On Friday morning, Mr. Hegseth met with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., telling him that “deterrence is necessary around the world, but specifically in this region, in your country, considering the threats from the communist Chinese.”</p><p>During the news briefing, Mr. Hegseth brought up unprompted the controversy around his role in sharing information about U.S. military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen on the commercial messaging app Signal. He said it was not his job to determine where the U.S. Seventh Fleet goes in Asia but that he would defer to U.S. Admiral Samuel Paparo, head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and “his war plans.”</p><p>“Real war plans,” Mr. Hegseth added, drawing chuckles. He said that Admiral Paparo would help create “strategic dilemmas for the Communist Chinese that would help them reconsider whether or not violence or action is something they want to undertake again.”</p><p>Mr. Hegseth was asked about whether he feels any responsibility for his role in the Signal controversy. He dodged the question, saying that he is proud of “that initial series of very effective and devastating strikes and the ongoing campaign that we are undertaking” against the Houthis.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Hegseth said the United States would conduct special operation forces training with the Philippines in the Batanes islands, which are about 120 miles south of Taiwan, a flashpoint between Washington and Beijing. He also added that the United States would deploy an anti-ship missile system and unmanned surface vehicles to the Philippines during the joint U.S.-Philippines military drills in April.</p><p>Mr. Marcos’s government is hoping to build on deepening ties that it forged during the Biden administration. The Philippines sees itself on the frontline of the territorial fight against Beijing in the South China Sea.</p><p>“I would like to categorically state that what is at stake in our unilateral and bilateral activities is not merely the security of either the United States or the Philippines,” Gilberto Teodoro, the Philippines defense secretary, said. “We are facing a common threat, which is the overreach of the Communist Party of China.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sui-Lee Wee is the Southeast Asia bureau chief for The Times, overseeing coverage of 11 countries in the region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sui-lee-wee">More about Sui-Lee Wee</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/communist-party-of-china">Communist Party of China</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on U.S.-China Relations</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Export Restrictions</strong><strong>: </strong>The Trump administration added 80 primarily Chinese companies and organizations to a list of companies that are barred from buying American technology and other exports because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/business/economy/trump-chinese-tech-firms-chips-security.html">national security concerns</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Consulting Firm Employees Freed: </strong>China has released five employees of an American corporate investigations firm, the Mintz Group, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/asia/china-mintz-release-us.html">two years after they were detained</a> as part of a crackdown by Beijing on foreign business consultancies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Panama Canal Deal: </strong>Beijing’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/business/trump-panama-canal-china-hong-kong.html">threat to stop a tycoon’s sale</a> of his ports business has dealmakers wondering if they can still operate without political interference.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Voice in Beijing:</strong> Senator Steve Daines of Montana, one of President Trump’s top allies in Congress, has cast himself as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/world/asia/trump-china-xi-daines.html">an intermediary between the Trump administration and Beijing</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>China Says It Offers Stability: </strong>China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, cast his country as a bulwark for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/asia/china-tariffs-us-trump.html">peace and stability in a world thrown into chaos by the Trump administration</a>, even as Beijing provokes its neighbors and fuels trade tensions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seeing a Cultural Revolution: </strong>People in China are expressing alarm at what looks like a familiar authoritarian turn in the United States, their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/business/china-donald-trump-cultural-revolution.html">longtime role model for democracy</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
