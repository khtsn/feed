Immigrant farmworkers can likewise receive state-funded medical and dental care.</p><p>California leaders have gradually expanded the services available to undocumented immigrants, expressing a sense of obligation to workers who toiled in fields and factories and contributed to the state’s prosperity.</p><p>Other Democratic-led states have done the same, with growing confidence that they were free from federal interference as long as they paid for the benefits themselves.</p><p>But President Trump and congressional Republicans are now using various levers to upend those efforts from Washington. And Democrats, including three possible presidential candidates who have proposed scaling back immigrant benefits for their own reasons, are left wrestling with how to respond.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Republicans are driven, some of them say, by a belief that benefits for immigrants entice people to enter the country illegally. Other Republicans also say they object to the idea that Americans’ tax dollars — no matter where they are collected — go toward undocumented immigrants.</p><p>“They can just come in here and sign up for health care, and we’re supposed to pay for it at the expense of some of our most vulnerable citizens?” said James Gallagher, the Republican leader of the California State Assembly. “I don’t think that’s a right use of our priorities.”</p><p>In liberal states, Republicans have newfound leverage from Washington after being powerless for years to block the expansion of immigrant services in their states.</p><p>Last month, Mr. Trump signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/protecting-american-communities-from-criminal-aliens/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> targeting state laws “that provide in-state higher education tuition to aliens but not to out-of-state American citizens.” This week, the Department of Homeland Security started <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/trump-california-aid-investigation.html" title="">an investigation</a> of a California program that helps some impoverished older and disabled immigrants, warning that “the gravy train is over.”</p><p>Perhaps the biggest concern for Democratic states is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/us/politics/house-gop-tax-bill-trump.html" title="">reconciliation bill</a> that Congress is considering, which calls for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/republicans-medicaid-cuts.html" title="">penalizing states</a> that use their own funds to provide health care to undocumented immigrants. That could cost states billions of dollars and make it financially untenable to continue those programs. It would also force states to decide between cutting some health care services for citizens or all services for undocumented immigrants, potentially creating a political wedge in Democratic states.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“They’re trying to create incentives and punishments for those states that provide benefits to undocumented people,” said Kevin R. Johnson, former dean of the law school at the University of California, Davis.</p><p>“The bigger picture is President Trump and his administration are dead set against immigrants, legal or undocumented, receiving any public benefits from the federal or state government,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>College students at Arizona State University in protest of ASU’s chapter of College Republicans United-led event encouraging students to report “their criminal classmates to ICE for deportations” in January 2025.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ross D.

In Minnesota, Gov. Tim Walz and state lawmakers this week <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-lawmakers-strike-a-deal-on-a-two-year-state-budget/601354311" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">agreed to scale back health care benefits</a> for undocumented adults to solve a budget gap, prompting outcry from progressive leaders. In Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker has <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/03/23/immigrant-health-care-illinois-pritzker-budget-cut" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed eliminating health care</a> for undocumented middle-age adults.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>And Gov. Gavin Newsom of California called this week for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/us/california-newsom-healthcare-budget.html" title="">freeze in undocumented enrollees</a> in the state’s Medi-Cal program, as well as a $100 monthly charge for immigrants who continue to receive benefits.</p><p>Democratic leaders say their moves were driven by the realities of their budgets, not by a need to acquiesce to the wishes of Republicans in Washington. But the optics are unavoidable, and many on the left <a href="https://apnews.com/article/gavin-newsom-california-governor-president-2028-moderate-7dfb281af0674e8b09304de94a6a8868" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wondered this week</a> if Mr. Newsom’s proposal was his latest attempt to moderate his image as he considers a presidential run in a nation less friendly to undocumented immigrants than it was several years ago.</p><p>The situation has already begun to split Democrats, with some saying that the party should fight for undocumented immigrants rather than retrench in the face of Mr. Trump’s moves.</p><p>“It’s always really easy to pick on immigrant communities,” said Lena Gonzalez, a Democratic state senator who leads the California Latino Legislative Caucus.</p><p>“We have seen this playbook time and time again,” she added. “We’re valued enough to be at work and be productive, but we’re not valued enough to be given a basic right, which I think is health care.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In Vermont, legislators in 2021 overwhelmingly approved a plan to use state funds to provide health care for undocumented children and pregnant women.</p><p>“This is a population that is critical to the economics of the state,” said Alyssa Black, a Democratic state representative from Essex, Vt. “We love to tout our dairy industry, and our dairy farms survive on their labor.”</p><p>She specifically recalled the legislative testimony of one mother, an immigrant from Guatemala, who said that when both her sons were sick, she could take only one to the doctor — the younger boy, who was born in the U.S.</p><p>Ms. Black said she had learned on Wednesday of looming fiscal consequences for states providing benefits to undocumented residents. “My heart just broke,” she said. “How can the federal government come in and determine what states can do with their state dollars?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Two dozen states allow undocumented students to pay in-state tuition at public colleges, and most of them also let those students apply for financial aid, according to the <a href="https://www.higheredimmigrationportal.org/undocumented-daca-students/data-tools/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Higher Ed Immigration Portal</a>, which collects education data. They are mostly Democratic-led states like New York, but even a handful of Republican states like Texas and Utah provide such discounts. Florida, however, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article300207944.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ended in-state tuition</a> for undocumented students this year.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump and congressional Republicans have ramped up their pressure on states that provide state-funded benefits to undocumented immigrants.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Patrick T. Fallon/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Six states provide <a href="https://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/tbl9_state-ssi_2024-06.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cash assistance</a> to some low-income immigrants who are older, blind or disabled but don’t qualify for federal Supplemental Security Income, according to the National Immigration Law Center. At least five states offer <a href="https://www.nilc.org/resources/state_food/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">food assistance</a> to some noncitizens.</p><p>Though the federal government doesn’t pay for these programs, they’re being scrutinized by Mr. Trump, who previously tried to deny green cards to immigrants who legally used any federal benefits such as food stamps and housing vouchers. He wanted to vastly expand the so-called “public charge” rule that has discouraged citizenship applicants from relying on public aid, an effort later rejected by courts. </p><p>“Any area where there’s public taxpayer dollars that are being used in a way that incentivizes lawbreaking is problematic and should be revisited,” said Representative Kevin Kiley, Republican of California.</p><p>Mr. Kiley spent years as a lawmaker in Sacramento, where he was in the political minority, routinely objecting to California policies but lacking the power to stop them. Now in Congress, he is part of a majority that is trying to change how states like California spend their dollars.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The Republican reconciliation bill, which conservatives <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/house-republicans-policy-bil.html" title="">blocked Friday</a> to seek deeper spending cuts, would cut Medicaid funding to states that use their own funds to pay for health care for low-income undocumented immigrants. Under the legislation, 14 states stand to collectively lose $75 billion from 2028 to 2034 if they keep those programs in place, <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/house-republican-bill-would-cut-medicaid-funding-to-states-providing-own-health" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.</p><p>That approach amounts to “weaponizing federal funding,” said Xavier Becerra, who was President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s secretary of health and human services. Mr. Becerra said he expected states to fight in court to stop the federal government’s interference.</p><p>“Much of what they’re doing ultimately will be overturned, especially if it starts to go into areas that the federal government doesn’t control,” said Mr. Becerra, a former attorney general of California who is now a Democratic candidate for governor.</p><p>Immigrant groups fear that the federal government may have other motivations for dipping into state affairs.</p><p>This week, <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/05/12/department-homeland-security-investigates-state-california-providing-federal" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Department of Homeland Security</a> said Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials had subpoenaed Los Angeles County for records, including the identities of people who applied for the state’s Cash Assistance Program for Immigrants. The department said it was exploring whether the state had used federal funds to support ineligible noncitizens.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>It was believed to be one of the first requests this year for state data on immigrants outside the criminal justice system.</p><p>The Trump administration’s attempt to collect “personal data, postal and sensitive data from people who are seeking benefits for which they are eligible, compromises their privacy and will chill access to critical services for California residents,” said Tanya Broder, senior counsel at the National Immigration Law Center.</p><p>If Democratic-led states thought they were on safe ground to provide their own benefits to immigrants without interference from Washington, it may have been because past Republican leaders believed in upholding states’ rights.</p><p>Mike Madrid, a “never Trump” Republican and former political director of the California Republican Party, said the federal government’s actions to disrupt how states serve their residents ran counter to longstanding conservative orthodoxy.</p><p>“This is unconscionable from a classically conservative position,” Mr. Madrid said, “and it just speaks to how much, not just the Republican Party has changed, but how much the country has changed.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Laurel Rosenhall is a Sacramento-based reporter covering California politics and government for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Jenna Russell is the lead reporter covering New England for The Times.
