    <h1>Cal Fire Engineer Accused of Starting 5 Northern California Wildfires</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A California firefighter was arrested Friday morning after allegedly setting five fires in wine country during what has already been a bad year for wildfires in the state.</p><p>Robert Hernandez, a 38-year-old fire apparatus engineer with Cal Fire, the state’s main firefighting agency, was arrested on suspicion of setting fires on forest land near the Northern California towns of Geyserville, Healdsburg and Windsor between Aug. 15 and Sept. 14.</p><p>The fires remained small, burning less than an acre of land combined, because local residents and firefighters worked quickly to extinguish them, according to Cal Fire. Mr. Hernandez, a resident of Healdsburg who was accused of setting the fires while off duty, was booked into the Sonoma County Main Adult Detention Facility on six felony counts and was being held on $2 million bail. </p><p>“I am appalled to learn one of our employees would violate the public’s trust and attempt to tarnish the tireless work of the 12,000 women and men of Cal Fire,” Joe Tyler, the director and fire chief of Cal Fire, said on Friday.</p></div></div>
