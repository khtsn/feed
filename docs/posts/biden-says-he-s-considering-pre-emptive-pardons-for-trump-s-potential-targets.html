    <h1>Biden Says He’s Considering Pre-emptive Pardons For Trump’s Potential Targets</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Biden said that he had appealed to the president-elect in a two-hour Oval Office meeting after the election. “I tried to make it clear that there was no need, and it was counterintuitive to go back and try to settle scores,” Mr. Biden said. But Mr. Trump did not say how he would handle his threats of retribution.</p><p>“He didn’t reinforce it; he just basically listened,” Mr. Biden said.</p><p>Since late last year, Mr. Biden’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/biden-trump-pardons.html" title="">staff has considered</a> what the pardons might look like were Mr. Biden to pursue them, including how to extend executive clemency to a list of current and former government officials for any possible crimes over a period of years.</p><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/trump-says-everyone-on-the-jan-6-committee-including-liz-cheney-should-go-to-jail-226490437697" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told NBC</a> recently that he would like to jail members of the congressional panel that investigated the Jan. 6 attack. Ms. Cheney served on the panel. At least two of its other members, Senator Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, and Adam Kinzinger, the former Republican representative, have said they do not want pardons, arguing that accepting one would falsely suggest that they had committed crimes.</p><p>“It would be the wrong precedent to set,” Mr. Schiff <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5069870-adam-schiff-biden-pardon-trump-jan-6/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told CNN</a> earlier this week. “I don’t want to see each president hereafter on their way out the door giving out a broad category of pardons.”</p></div></div>
