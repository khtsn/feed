Expectations were heightened when, in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/26/world/europe/pope-women-vote-bishops-meeting.html" title="">historic first</a>, Francis had allowed 54 women to participate as voting members of the 368-member assembly, which mostly comprises bishops.</p><p>Deacons are ordained ministers who can preach and perform weddings, funerals and baptisms. But they can’t celebrate Mass, a role reserved for the all-male priesthood.</p><p>Opponents to allowing female deacons see it as a first step to making them priests, which they say would violate 2,000 years of church doctrine and undermine its authority. Conversely, some historians point to documents showing that women were deacons in the early church.</p><p>Enthusiasm over the prospect of change was dampened, however, when a meeting last year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/world/europe/pope-vatican-synod-women-lgbtq.html" title="">ended with a document</a> that said it was “urgent” that women have more leadership roles in the church — but punted on the issue of female deacons. </p><p>Then in February, Francis announced that the issue would be handed to a study group, which will report its findings to the pope next summer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>This month’s meeting will instead focus on how the church can more fully engage the faithful and encourage greater dialogue at all levels, within the context of the diversity of the global church.</p><p>These are not moot points; <a href="https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2024-04/vatican-central-statistical-office-church-pontifical-yearbook.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fewer men are entering the priesthood</a> in most of the world. And even as the number of Catholics has increased, especially in Africa and Asia, there are no trustworthy statistics on <a href="https://nineteensixty-four.blogspot.com/2023/01/where-is-mass-attendance-highest-and.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">how many are attending Mass</a> and participating in the life of the church.</p><p>Many Catholics say the church has to keep pace with the reality that women already manage parishes in some areas of the world where there is a shortage of priests, like the Amazon and even in the United States.</p><p>Some bishops felt they had been given a mandate to push for greater equality, so removing the question of female deacons would disappoint their faithful. “There are expectations on the part of many of our Swiss Catholics,” said the Rev. Felix Gmür, Bishop of Basel. “The involvement and engagement of women is crucial for Switzerland.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>During his 11-year papacy, Pope Francis has opened some doors to women, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/world/europe/pope-women.html" title="">changing laws</a> to formally allow women to give readings from the Bible during Mass, act as altar servers and distribute Communion. He also named several women to high-ranking positions in the Vatican, including appointing Sister Nathalie Becquart of France as one of the synod’s top officials. But he has ruled out ordaining women as priests, and in a recent CBS interview seemed to close the door on <a href="https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2024/05/21/pope-francis-60-minutes-women-deacons-247995" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">female deacons</a> definitively as well.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pope Francis during the 16th general assembly of the synod at the Vatican last year.

Speaking on behalf of the church, “especially us men,” Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the prefect of the Vatican’s department for laity, family and life, asked for forgiveness, “feeling shame for all the times that we have not recognized and defended the dignity of women.”</p><p>Though female deacons won’t be discussed, women’s leadership and ministry are still on the agenda.</p><p>Some delegates said it would have been unreasonable to expect that such a global assembly could have arrived at a consensus on a wide variety of topics in the space of a month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“We’re dealing with everything from financial issues around transparency, to how pastoral councils work, to the role of the bishop in managing cases of abuse, to L.G.B.T.Q. welcome, to polygamy, the list of what we’re dealing with in the room is just is so immense,” said Prof. Anna Rowlands, who teaches Catholic social thought and practice at Durham University in England. “There’s this tension between the time it takes to build consensus in the room, and the pressing urgency of the clamor coming from, you know, outside of the walls of the synod office and how you live with both those things.”</p><p>The Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit father who is an outspoken advocate of greater L.G.B.T.Q. inclusiveness in the church and is a delegate, said some people would inevitably be disappointed. “But I would also say that there was progress made last year because things that had never been discussed before were discussed,” he said. “And so that itself was a step forward.”</p><p>Another liberal Jesuit, the Rev. Thomas Reese, who is not a delegate, pointed out that while some North American and European Catholics hoping to see major changes might see the synod as a “complete bust,” for other areas of the world the fact that the pope “wanted to get women seats at the table is revolutionary in parts of Africa, Latin America and Asia.”</p><p>Observers said they hoped that the process of listening that Francis has enacted would inspire the bishops to act courageously. “I am still very much excited about the synodal process,” said Ellie Hidalgo, co-director of <a href="https://discerningdeacons.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Discerning Deacons</a>, which advocates female deacons. That’s because having the discussion, she said, allows “synod members to highlight the leadership and the ministry of women that we’re already seeing all over the world.” </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Elisabetta Povoledo is a reporter based in Rome, covering Italy, the Vatican and the culture of the region.
