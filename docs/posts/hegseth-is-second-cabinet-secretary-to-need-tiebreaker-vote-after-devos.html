    <h1>Hegseth Is Second Cabinet Secretary to Need Tiebreaker Vote, After DeVos</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nearly eight years ago, another Trump administration cabinet secretary barely survived her confirmation vote, advancing only after a vice president’s tiebreaker vote.</p><p>That nominee was Betsy DeVos, the wealthy Republican donor who had almost no experience in public education and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/us/politics/betsy-devos-education-secretary-confirmed.html" title="">who was confirmed to lead the Department of Education</a>.</p><p>On Feb. 7, 2017, two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, turned against Mr. Trump’s pick for the job and voted against her. But without a third Republican to join their ranks, Ms. Devos was ultimately confirmed on a 51-to-50 vote.</p><p>It was the first time a vice president — in this case, Vice President Mike Pence — had been summoned to the Capitol to break a tie on a cabinet nomination.</p></div></div>
