It’s near the highest return you could have received since 2008, and for now, at least, would be widely considered risk-free.</p><p>I’m sorry to tell you there are plenty of reasons this may be too good to be true. The bond market is telling us something about the dawn of the second Trump presidency, and it’s not pretty.</p><p>Fixed-income analysts and central bankers care about what’s driving the Treasury bond yield, and it’s something called the term premium. That’s the technical phrase for the amount of interest investors demand over and above where the Federal Reserve sets rates. Recently it’s been rising quickly.</p><p>The question is why. An increase sometimes suggests investors foresee a robust period of long-term growth that might require higher rates in the future to cool things down. In recent weeks, however, it appears to reflect their worries much more than their optimism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>This shouldn’t come as a surprise. Most of the policies proposed by President Trump, from tariffs to additional fiscal stimulus to deportations that tighten the labor market, are expected to add to inflation. And to the degree they are enacted, they will combine with an inflation rate that has declined rapidly, but which remains above the Federal Reserve’s target and is still higher than it was during most of the decade leading up to the pandemic. Rising long-term rates are bad for businesses and households that need to borrow, since the cost of loans such as mortgages and auto loans are directly linked to 10-year Treasury yields.</p><p>Evidence of consumer and investor worry abounds. The University of Michigan’s latest consumer survey saw expectations for longer-term inflation rise to 3.2 percent, one of the highest levels recorded since 2008. Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December policy meeting showed that “all participants judged that uncertainty about the scope, timing and economic effects of potential changes in policies affecting foreign trade and immigration was elevated” and “the risks around the inflation forecast were seen as tilted to the upside.” Translation: There’s probably going to be more inflation.</p><p>That means that the central bank will find it harder to cut rates. Already, financial markets have reduced their expectations of Fed cuts in 2025 to one or two, compared with five or six just three months ago. Most of the time, a relatively hawkish Fed will raise yields for all kinds of bonds.</p><p>Concern that the new administration will increase the budget deficit is also a factor. Even before any new stimulus this year, the Congressional Budget Office has <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60870" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimated</a> the budget deficit will widen from $1.9 trillion in 2025 to $2.7 trillion by 2035.</p><p>The Treasury will need to increase the amount of bonds it issues to fund bigger deficits. The Fed is also selling its own stock of bonds left over from post-financial crisis rescues, which adds to the need to find willing Treasury buyers. Many potential overseas buyers are set to face increased tariffs from the United States and may prefer investment options outside America. Economics 101 tells us that more supply without corresponding demand pushes down prices. In the case of bonds, lower prices mean higher yields. Investors are saying, essentially, they want to be paid more to hold America’s debt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Since bond yields act as a starting point for many other borrowing costs, families feel the hit quickly. The point was made clear this month in a speech by the New York Federal Reserve president, John Williams. He said rising costs for home mortgages mean less money for essentials such as food, health care and child care. “The repercussions reverberate through all aspects of our economy,” Mr. Williams noted. “Housing affordability affects the ability of communities to attract businesses, and it affects the ability of employers to attract and retain workers and grow their businesses.”</p><p>Higher yields, for borrowers, at least, are always a challenge. For households and businesses, the same factors driving yields — inflation and fiscal concerns — can also weigh on their confidence and expectations for growth. In such an environment, equity values can fall at the same time bond yields rise. That’s bad news for your 401(k). And for companies, borrowing costs could go up at the same time their share prices are declining. That bodes poorly for hiring and investment budgets. A negative feedback loop can form quickly.</p><p>We saw this in the third quarter of 2023, after the Treasury announced it would need to issue more debt than had been expected. The government’s credit rating was downgraded by Fitch Ratings and the 10-year Treasury term premium rose sharply. Bond yields quickly rose toward 5 percent and equities fell by 3.3 percent in the quarter. Measures of business confidence, not surprisingly, fell throughout.</p><p>With the American bond market by far the largest in the world and the dollar the dominant global currency, what happens in the United States often spills over. That can weigh on households with global diversification in their portfolios and businesses with overseas operations. In recent weeks, the contagion has been most notable in the United Kingdom, where 10-year government bond yields hit their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/business/bonds-gilt-yield-britain-economy.html" title="">highest level</a> since 2008. Both countries need to find sufficient buyers for increasing amounts of government debt.</p><p>There is a more benign scenario in which rising term premiums and higher bond yields can occur alongside appreciating equity markets, in which case savers benefit and borrowers’ challenges are more manageable. Instead of inflation or supply concerns, it’s expectations for robust longer-term growth prospects that lift the term premium.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That’s what might have happened between mid-September and mid-November 2024, when the S&amp;P 500, the term premium on a 10-year Treasury and the bond yield itself all rose in tandem, even after the Federal Reserve cut the short-term interest rate. While difficult to quantify, it appeared this partly reflected growing expectations that a second Trump administration would embark on substantial economic deregulation that would boost growth without a rise in inflation.</p><p>That wouldn’t be a terrible outcome. It’s going to be up to the new administration, as it starts executing policy, to help determine whether we get a term premium that’s optimistic or worrying. Targeted, limited tariffs and an equally limited increase in the deficit, combined with notable progress on deregulation, may be the best we can realistically hope for.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Rebecca Patterson is an economist and a market strategist, and a former top executive at J.P.
