She was 107.</p><p>The death was confirmed her daughter, Lindy Webb.</p><p>In 1961, Ms. Colvin, a middle-aged, college-educated Syracuse homemaker and mother of two, was appalled to discover that the recent census had counted 11,055 residents of Onondaga County, N.Y., who could not read or write. She had no experience teaching, but felt passionately that she had to do something about it.</p><p>A year later, after consulting reading specialists and service agencies, she opened an office in her basement, began recruiting volunteers from churches to be tutors, wrote training manuals, and set up a small group to reach out to residents, many of them immigrants, to teach them basic English, offering pathways to jobs, education and rising standards of living.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Colvin in an undated photo.

In 1967, the group, Literacy Volunteers, was chartered by New York State as a nonprofit with 77 tutors, 100 students and Ms. Colvin as its first president. In succeeding decades under her guidance, the organization won federal and private grants, created programs in many states, won national recognition and changed its name to Literacy Volunteers of America.</p></div><div><div><p>After a 2002 merger with Laubach Literacy International, the organization became <a href="https://www.proliteracy.org/About-Us/Mission-History" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ProLiteracy</a>, with hundreds of programs and 100,000 tutors in 42 states and 60 other countries, offering lessons in scores of languages at homes, workplaces, prisons and other sites. For 60 years, Ms. Colvin remained a teacher and administrator, traveled widely and wrote 12 books on her work.</p><p>She was showered with honorary doctorates and received the President’s Volunteer Service Award from President Ronald Reagan in 1987. She was inducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame in 1993 and received the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, from President George W. Bush in a 2006 White House ceremony.</p><p>“Ruth Colvin is a person of intelligence and vision and heart,” Mr. Bush said in making the presentation. “And she has earned the gratitude of many and the admiration of us all.”</p><p>In 2019, still working, exercising and playing golf at the age of 102, Ms. Colvin <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rachel-may/senator-rachel-may-recognize-literacy-pioneer-ruth-johnson-colvin" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was feted by the New York State Senate</a> in Albany as a pioneering champion of literacy. Senator Rachel May, a Syracuse Democrat and chairwoman of the Committee on Aging, said, “Ruth Colvin reminds us all by her example of the profound positive impact one person can have on the lives of others.”</p></div></div><div><p>In a November 2020 phone interview for this obituary from her home in Syracuse, Ms. Colvin, then a month short of 104, offered an encyclopedic valedictory on her life, recalling names, dates, schools and colleges (she attended four), as well as travels, song lyrics, relationships with relatives and friends long gone and a finely tuned appreciation of the diverse world of religions, races and cultures she had seen.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Colvin in 2021. “I’m asked all the time about the secret to my longevity,” she once said. “It’s a balanced life, I tell them.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via ProLiteracy</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>“Who wants to read about this old lady?” she said. “I’m asked all the time about the secret to my longevity. It’s a balanced life, I tell them.”</p><p>“When you look back over what happened in your life,” she added, “you see the things that made you what you are. In my case, those things made me a very determined person.”</p><p>For 43 million Americans and almost 800 million people worldwide who still struggle to fill out a job application or read a bedtime story to their children, Ruth Johnson Colvin is hardly a household name, and for most of them written accounts of her life are still beyond reach.</p></div></div><div><div><p>She was born Ruth Johnson in Chicago on Dec. 16, 1916, the oldest of five children of Harry and Lillian Johnson, who shared a Swedish surname.</p><p>Ruth and her siblings, Harriette, Harry Jr., George and Lucille, were raised in Chicago. Her father, a businessman who was an owner of a construction company, died when Ruth was 12. (Her mother later worked in the bridal department in the Marshall Field’s department store of Chicago and a small children’s store in Syracuse.) He had set aside money for college for all his children. But when Ruth graduated from Fenger Academy High School in Chicago in 1934, she learned that an uncle, the executor of her father’s estate, had reserved the college money for her brothers and would pay her expenses only for a secretarial school, because she was “just a girl,” as she put it.</p><p>Undaunted, Ruth, an avid reader with excellent grades, attended night classes at Thornton Junior College in Harvey, Ill. She graduated in 1936, after two years, with an associate degree.</p><p>“But that was a blessing in disguise,” she said, “because it was there, in those night classes, that I met the future love of my life, Robert John Colvin, who was to be my life’s partner for 73 years. We barely knew one another at that time, though. We were each dating someone else.”</p><p>Still unable to afford full college tuition, she attended the Moser School, a business college in Chicago, for a year. She also became a legal secretary for the law firm that finally settled her father’s estate.</p></div></div><div><div><p>With the settlement, all five siblings were able to attend college. Ruth enrolled at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., where she discovered that Mr. Colvin was a fellow student. They began dating.</p><p>They were married in 1940 and had two children, Terrence and Lindy. Mr. Colvin, who traveled with his wife all over the world during her literacy education work, died at 99 in 2014.</p><p>In addition to her children, she is survived by six grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.</p><p>Ms. Colvin and her husband briefly settled in Seattle, where Mr. Colvin joined an industrial chemical company. They moved to Syracuse in 1942, and as World War II got underway he was classified as a critical employee in a company making essential wartime supplies and was exempted from military service.</p><p>After the war, Mr. Colvin began a consulting and sales career in industrial chemicals, and Ms. Colvin resumed her education, enrolling at Syracuse University, where she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1959. Her reading had always been eclectic, and in the late 1950s she became interested in the problems of illiteracy in underdeveloped countries.</p><p>When the 1960 census results were released, she learned that the problem was closer to home. She enlisted community groups, including Church Women United, which decided to sponsor Ms. Colvin’s Literacy Volunteers. She wrote two training manuals, “Tutor” and “I Speak English,” and recruits were soon using them in the program.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Colvin in 1970. Her dreams of aiding illiterate people in underdeveloped nations became a reality when her organization, Literacy Volunteers of America, merged with Laubach Literacy International in 2002 and became ProLiteracy, with hundreds of programs and 100,000 tutors in 42 states and 60 other countries.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via ProLiteracy</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Immigrants constituted half of the county’s functionally illiterate people, and in 1974, three years after her programs took on national scope, she created a training program in English as a Second Language. She also helped found the National Coalition for Literacy to raise public awareness of America’s illiteracy problems.</p><p>Ms. Colvin’s dreams of aiding illiterate people in underdeveloped nations became a reality after the merger of Literacy Volunteers of America with Laubach Literacy International, an influential organization founded in 1930 by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/12/archives/dr-frank-c-laubach-crusader-against-illiteracy-dead-at-85.html" title="">Frank C. Laubach</a> when he was a missionary in the Philippines.</p><p>In succeeding decades, as Ms. Colvin became an international administrator, trainer of tutors and teacher in ProLiteracy Worldwide, she and her husband traveled extensively and established literacy programs in schools for adults, libraries, prisons and industries. As a spinoff, she wrote “Great Traveling After 55” (1989) and “Off the Beaten Path: Stories of People Around the World” (2011).</p><p>In recent years, she developed literacy programs in Madagascar, New Guinea, Zambia, Guatemala, Pakistan, Somalia and China. Her last book was “My Travels Through Life, Love and Literacy: A Journey Over 100 Years in the Making” (2020).</p></div></div><div><div><p>In a commencement address at Le Moyne College in Syracuse in 2018, when she was 101, Ms. Colvin, in mortarboard and gown, held up a sign: KDZQMHMF.</p><p>“This is my advice to you,” she told the graduating seniors. “Read it. You can’t read?</p><p>“Yes, I’m putting you in the shoes of a nonreader. Frustrating, isn’t it? But there is a joy in reading something you couldn’t read before, and I’m going to give you this joy. But you’ve got to know the code. What is the letter of the alphabet that follows each letter in the code?”</p><p>The audience spelled it out slowly, letter by letter: “L — E — A — R — N — I — N — G.”</p><p>“Yes,” she said. “Learning!</p><p>“Keep on learning! That’s my passion: Teaching adults to read, write and understand English.”</p><p>Alex Traub<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
