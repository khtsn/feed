Some Democrats say a few of their reliable donors are now openly supporting Mr. Trump, or at least looking to curry favor with him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Fund-raising slowdowns are common after a presidential defeat and before marquee midterm races fully begin. But interviews with more than 50 donors, strategists and leaders of activist organizations show that many Democrats believe this year is different.</p><p>While Mr. Trump has not taken action against any liberal groups or lawmakers, Democrats worry his frequent threats of retribution during the campaign have led to a chilling effect on the charitable foundations and nonprofit advocacy groups that have long been pillars of the country’s civil society.</p><p>Jeff Skoll, a Silicon Valley billionaire and a longtime friend of Elon Musk’s, said there was “an awful lot of pressure” to side with Mr. Trump.</p><p>This month, Mr. Skoll, who has donated tens of millions to Democratic candidates and causes in recent years but said he did not vote in the 2024 presidential election, posted a <a href="https://x.com/jeffskoll/status/1881689083623166100" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">photo on social media</a> of himself standing with Mr. Trump backstage at the inauguration. On Friday, he had breakfast in Palm Beach, Fla., with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, where they discussed the prospect of Mr. Schumer’s using Mr. Skoll to back-channel ideas to the president, Mr. Skoll said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Schumer recalls the conversation differently, according to an aide, Allison Biasotti.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Silicon Valley billionaire Jeff Skoll in 2017.

Groups that support L.G.B.T.Q. rights, promote gender equity and champion other progressive causes have cut staffing and announced that longtime leaders are leaving.</p><p>End Citizens United, a left-leaning group that aims to overhaul campaign finance laws, laid off its six senior staff members last month as part of a restructuring. Run for Something, which works to elect liberal down-ballot candidates, laid off 35 percent of its staff late last year. And GLSEN, a group dedicated to protecting L.G.B.T.Q. students, laid off 25 people last month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“No one is giving until they see a plan for how we are going to better navigate this unprecedented situation and stop acting like this is a normal administration,” said Alexandra Acker-Lyons, a political consultant who is close to Silicon Valley donors.</p><h2 id="link-4799c572">Worries about ‘repercussions’ from Trump</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Center for American Progress, the Democratic Party’s most prominent policy group, cut 22 people — 8 percent of its staff — this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The downsizing has reached some of the most storied brands in Democratic politics.</p><p>Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy group, <a href="https://www.advocate.com/news/human-rights-campaign-layoffs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">laid off 20 percent of its staff</a> in what it called a “strategic restructure.” This month, the Center for American Progress, the party’s most prominent policy group, cut 22 people — 8 percent of its staff.</p><p>“It was the right time to reset our staffing in the environment we find ourselves in,” said Colin Seeberger, a C.A.P. spokesman.</p><p>Not all of the party’s biggest funders feel quite as confident.</p><p>Aides to Reid Hoffman, the billionaire LinkedIn co-founder and one of the biggest Democratic donors, have signaled that he is now much more reluctant to fund progressive political projects. A spokeswoman for Mr. Hoffman said that “he thinks that the Democratic Party strategy needs to reform, and when it does, he’s happy to hear new ideas and new pitches.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Hoffman has also voiced publicly what many donors have said privately: He expects retaliation from Mr. Trump.</p><p>“There’s a greater than 50 percent chance that there will be repercussions from a misdirection and corruption of the institutions of state to respond to my having tried to help Harris get elected,” he said on the podcast “The Diary of a CEO.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Reid Hoffman, the billionaire LinkedIn co-founder, is one of the biggest Democratic donors to signal a reluctance to fund liberal causes.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dominik Bindl/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Cooper Teboe, a strategist in Silicon Valley, said about a half-dozen major donors had told him they were temporarily pausing political giving out of fear of political retribution. He said he believed donors would be back in full force by May, as anger toward Mr. Trump rose.</p><p>“‘We don’t know if he’s going to go after people,’” Mr. Teboe said, paraphrasing the donors. “‘We do not want to be on the top of that list. We’re going to hold off and see if he really is, or if it’s all bluster.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Some donors are hiring additional legal counsel to address worries about tax audits, congressional investigations and lawsuits. Others are moving assets overseas, or at least their foundations to Democratic-controlled states.</p><p>Donors increasingly want to stay anonymous, which could slow the flow of cash to Democratic super PACs because they must eventually disclose their donors.</p><p>Liz Minnella, a top Democratic fund-raiser, started a political group this year, Connect Forward, to help create a media ecosystem of liberal voices. She said she structured it as a nonprofit 501(c)(4) organization — which does not have to disclose its donors — in part because she was “prioritizing protecting our donors” from possible retribution.</p><p>At a November meeting of the Democracy Alliance, a liberal donor network, funders were advised on steps to protect themselves from lawsuits, audits and investigations. To limit legal risk, the group has also changed its document retention policies to hold digital communications for only a month.</p><p>Much of the concern centers on legislation in Congress that would remove the tax-exempt status of nonprofit groups that are found to be supporting terrorist organizations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>After Mr. Trump won the election, the Democracy Alliance urged its donors to lobby against the bill during the lame-duck session, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/house-antiterror-financing-bill.html" title="">fearing it could be weaponized against progressive groups</a> and could even be used to shutter ActBlue, the online fund-raising platform.</p><p>During a presentation to Democracy Alliance donors, former Representative Donna Edwards, a Maryland Democrat, flashed a slide showing all Democratic members of Congress who had cast “yes” or “absent” votes for the measure in the past. She encouraged donors to push them to change their positions.</p><p>The bill passed the House last year but died in the Senate. Democrats worry that Republicans, who now fully control Congress, could pass the bill into law.</p><p>Pamela Shifman, the group’s president, said the possibility of retribution only made donors’ work more critical.</p><p>“Their goal is to intimidate us and wear us down,” she said of the Trump administration. “Our strategy is to step up and step into a fight for democracy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p><h2 id="link-636e40c">Cash with conditions</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>George Soros’s team gathered a number of major donors and players in Washington this past week to talk about the progressive media landscape and plot future investments.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jason Alden/Bloomberg</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Unease extends into the offices of prominent foundations, whose leaders fear being hauled into high-profile congressional hearings similar to those that damaged the reputations of top college presidents in 2023.</p><p>Not everyone is dialing back. On Wednesday, aides to George Soros, one of the Democratic Party’s largest donors, helped gather a number of major contributors and players in Washington, including Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Tina Smith of Minnesota. The group talked about the progressive media landscape and plotted future investments, according to three people with knowledge of the event, who insisted on anonymity because it was private.</p><p>But some donors are putting new requirements on the cash they hand out. Many remain frustrated that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/us/politics/harris-campaign-finances.html" title="">the $1.5 billion frenzy of spending</a> to elect former Vice President Kamala Harris resulted in defeat.</p><p>They want to know what, exactly, Democrats plan to do differently in the future. Some are demanding more detailed information about the plans and specific targets of liberal groups — including the main pro-Harris super PAC, Future Forward — and candidates before continuing their contributions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>“People are mostly on the ropes or on the mat waiting for leadership, scratching our heads and giving grace to Schumer and Jeffries, who are saying, ‘Pick your battles,’” said Robert Raben, a Democratic consultant, referring to Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Robert Raben, a Democratic consultant, said many donors were taking a wait-and-see approach.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Larry French/Getty Images for March On Washington Film Festival</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>John Morgan, a wealthy Florida donor who was a vocal supporter of former President Joseph R.
