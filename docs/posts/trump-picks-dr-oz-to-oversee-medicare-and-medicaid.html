Trump said on Tuesday that he would nominate Dr. Mehmet Oz, the author and former television host, to serve as the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a powerful agency that oversees health insurance programs covering more than 150 million Americans.</p><p>The selection of Dr. Oz, who lost to John Fetterman in 2022 in a race to represent Pennsylvania in the Senate, was a surprise to many close watchers of the agency, even in a health department that could be led by another unconventional pick, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/us/politics/rfk-jr-trump-hhs.html" title="">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> It also continued a trend of Mr. Trump selecting television personalities to oversee federal agencies. His <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/politics/trump-administration-cabinet-appointees.html" title="">candidates to run the Defense and Transportation Departments</a> have been working for Fox News and Fox Business.</p><p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services oversee several of the country’s largest government programs, providing health coverage to more than 150 million Americans. They regulate health insurance and set policy that guides the prices that doctors, hospitals and drug companies are paid for many medical services. <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59727" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">About a quarter</a> of all federal spending runs through the centers.</p><p>The centers are part of the Department of Health and Human Services, which also includes the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Their presence among those high-profile divisions has sometimes led to their work being overshadowed, despite their enormous influence in the American health system.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“C.M.S. touches virtually every family in America through Medicaid and Medicare, and it’s probably the most challenging technical, policy and political job in government,” said Drew Altman, the president of KFF, a health research group. “Even small, almost daily decisions at C.M.S. are billion-dollar decisions that affect industries and patients with serious illnesses who really care.”</p><p>In a statement announcing his choice, Mr. Trump said Dr. Oz would “work closely with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to take on the illness industrial complex, and all the horrible chronic diseases left in its wake.” Mr. Trump noted that Dr. Oz had “won nine Daytime Emmy Awards hosting ‘The Dr. Oz Show,’ where he taught millions of Americans how to make healthier lifestyle choices.”</p><p>Dr. Oz, a heart surgeon and the son of Turkish immigrants, does not have experience running a large federal bureaucracy. Past leaders of the agency have typically had experience working in roles that dealt broadly with health insurance policy, including government positions.</p><p>Dr. Oz has also frequently clashed with other medical experts. In the early days of the pandemic, he promoted the malaria drugs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/health/fda-hydroxychloroquine-malaria.html" title="">hydroxychloroquine</a> and chloroquine to ward off the coronavirus, medicines that were shown to be ineffective in treating the virus. A decade ago, he went before a Senate panel and was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/18/us/doctor-on-tv-says-hell-back-off-on-weight-claims.html" title="">chastised for hyping so-called miracle weight loss products</a> without substantial proof that they worked.</p><p>“Even putting aside the raft of alarming pseudoscience Dr. Oz has previously endorsed, it is deeply disappointing to see someone with zero qualifications being announced to head up such a critical agency,” Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat who used to lead the Senate health committee, said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Dr. Oz has weighed in on Medicare policy, helping to write a 2020 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveforbes/2020/06/11/medicare-advantage-for-all-can-save-our-health-care-system/?sh=ae4b87f4d120" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opinion column in Forbes</a> arguing for a universal health coverage system, in which every American not covered by Medicaid would be enrolled in a private Medicare Advantage plan. The coverage expansion, the column said, would be financed by an “affordable 20 percent payroll tax,” and would eliminate employer health coverage and the government Medicare program.</p><p>That strategy would be far out of the mainstream of conservative health policy. In 2019, Vice President Kamala Harris, then a candidate for president, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-medicare-for-all.html" title="">proposed a version</a> of a “Medicare for all” plan with similarities to Dr. Oz’s 2020 idea. Instead of replacing private coverage with a government-run system, as some of her Democratic rivals had done, Ms. Harris called for allowing people to choose between a government Medicare program and plans modeled on Medicare Advantage.</p><p>Dr. Oz will also be pressed to outline an agenda for Medicaid, the joint federal-state program that covers more than 70 million poor and disabled Americans. Republican lawmakers and conservative policy experts in recent months have pressed for major changes to the program, including cutting federal funding for it and tightening rules for eligibility. </p><p>The agency also oversees insurance marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Mr. Trump unsuccessfully tried to overturn large portions of the law during his first term, and has been vague about his ambitions for it now. Dr. Oz has supported the law’s goal of expanded health insurance coverage, though <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/13/politics/dr-oz-health-care-policy-mandates-obamacare/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he has been critical</a> of its details, characterizing it as a government takeover of the health care system.</p><p>Christina Jewett<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>21</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Trump Plans to Nominate Oz to Oversee Medicare and Medicaid Programs<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Trump Builds His Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Smashing the Status Quo: </strong>President-elect Donald Trump’s early transition moves amount to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/us/politics/trump-signals-a-seismic-shift-shocking-the-washington-establishment.html">generational stress test for the system</a> as he seeks to rewrite the balance of power and install lieutenants to blow up key parts of government.</p></li><li><p><strong>Plans for Mass Deportations: </strong>Trump confirmed that he intended to declare a national emergency and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/politics/trump-military-mass-deportation.html">use the U.S. military in some form</a> to assist in his plans for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.</p></li><li><p><strong>Economic Wild Cards: </strong>Predicting how White House policy is going to affect the American economy is always fraught with uncertainty. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/politics/trump-economy-immigration-inflation-fed.html">Trump’s return to the White House has taken the doubt up a notch</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transportation Secretary: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/politics/sean-duffy-trump-transportation-dot.html">Sean Duffy</a>, a former Wisconsin congressman and Fox Business host, was selected by Trump to lead the Transportation Department.</p></li><li><p><strong>Boosters Expect Big Returns: </strong>Wealthy donors to Trump’s campaign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/us/politics/trump-presidency-billionaires.html">anticipate a more business-friendly atmosphere</a>, including the firing of Biden-era regulators.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
