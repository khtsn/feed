Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/us/politics/debate-trump-harris-deadline.html" title="">refused invitations</a> for a second debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, “Saturday Night Live” came up with another setting where both presidential nominees might share the stage: the game show “Family Feud.”</p><p>This weekend’s “S.N.L.” broadcast, hosted by Ariana Grande and featuring the musical guest Stevie Nicks, opened with what looked like a CNN report — but quickly threw to a special election edition of “Family Feud,” hosted by Steve Harvey (played by Kenan Thompson).</p><p>Thompson first introduced the players on the Democratic team, led by Maya Rudolph in her recurring role as Harris. “My campaign has raised a billion dollars,” Rudolph noted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“How are you not winning by a landslide?” Thompson asked her.</p><p>Rudolph laughed and then replied, “That’s a question I scream into my pillow every morning.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The rest of the Democratic team included Andy Samberg as Doug Emhoff, Jim Gaffigan as Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota (“I am such a huge fan of your standup, Cedric,” he told Thompson) and Dana Carvey as President Biden.</p><p>Told by Thompson that he was looking good, Carvey replied: “’Cause I’m getting my rest. No. 1, I sleep when I can. No. 2, I’m asleep right now.”</p><p>Next, Thompson introduced the Republican team, helmed by James Austin Johnson as Trump.</p><p>“Let’s move over to President Trump’s lovely wife, Melania,” Thompson said, indicating an empty space at the contestants’ table. After a pause, he added, “Oh, she ain’t here.”</p><p>“It’s so strange,” Johnson said. “I could have sworn she was standing right beside me two years ago.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Republican team was rounded out by Senator JD Vance (Bowen Yang) and Donald Trump Jr. (Mikey Day), who said that his Trump Jr. and Yang’s Vance were pretty much twins.</p><p>“It’s almost like my dad picked me to be his vice president,” Day said. “But he didn’t. He didn’t.”</p><p>Rudolph and Johnson traded a few barbs before they were asked to respond to the game’s first survey question: Name something you keep in your glove compartment.</p><p>Rudolph rang in first and began to answer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kamalaharris/reel/C-vjZA6hi0D/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">with a familiar portion</a> from Harris’s stump speech — “I was raised in a middle-class family” — before giving a proper answer: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/harris-gun-glock-60-minutes.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">A big old Glock</a>.” That got the Democrats control of the board.</p><p>Samberg opted to give the same answer as Harris. (A second gun was the No. 1 answer.) But Gaffigan answered with HotHands, napkins and Tums “in case I eat something spicy like tomato.” Carvey’s response was “I’d like to buy a vowel.”</p><p>Given the opportunity to steal it for the Republicans, Johnson began to give a long, discursive answer about “Seinfeld,” mom jeans, immigrants and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/style/moo-deng-baby-pygmy-hippo-thailand.html" title="">Moo Deng</a>.</p><p>Thompson took it all in, looked at the game board and said, “Show me dementia.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-15a22daf">Musical guest host of the week</h2><p>Grande, the onetime theater kid turned pop music sensation and co-star of the movie musical “Wicked,” vowed at the start of her monologue that she was on “S.N.L.” only to host and not to steal the thunder of Nicks, the actual musical guest.</p><p>But Grande did, of course, sing in a number of segments, including one sketch that had her play a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLn5qNngGn4&amp;ab_channel=SaturdayNightLive" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not entirely on-key bridesmaid singing a parody of Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso”</a> and another that cast her as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmI1MSmHFA0&amp;ab_channel=SaturdayNightLive" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Renaissance castrato</a>.</p><p>But Grande’s skills were perhaps best put to use in the musical number that accompanied her monologue, a song about how she wasn’t going to sing or perform celebrity impressions. While dropping her on-the-nose impersonations of Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus and Gwen Stefani, Grande also sang the line, “I’m not going to do a duet tonight / So please don’t bring out Stevie Nicks.” When Nicks did not appear, Grande quickly added, “Worth a shot.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-65940c55">It’s all coming back to me now of the week</h2><p>Grande’s established arsenal of celebrity impressions also <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ariana+grande+celine+dion&amp;oq=ariana+grande+celine+dion&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDM1NzVqMGoxqAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&amp;vld=cid:0721f3c0,vid:ss9ygQqqL2Q,st:336" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">includes Celine Dion</a>, but it wasn’t certain she would get a timely reason to play the Canadian singer, who has performed only rarely since revealing she has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/movies/celine-dion-documentary-seizure-stiff-person-syndrome.html" title="">a neurological condition called stiff person syndrome</a>.</p><p>Then the news cycle came through: There was Dion, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2geo0F4Wiv8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appearing in a promotional segment for “Sunday Night Football”</a> and getting doused with Gatorade. That was inspiration enough for this “S.N.L.” segment, where Grande played Dion promoting another equally improbable sport: the Ultimate Fighting Championship. And you know that her heart will Octa-go on.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-fd29bf3">Weekend Update jokes of the week</h2><p>Over at the Weekend Update desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff on the 2024 presidential race.</p><p>Jost began:</p><blockquote><p>Donald Trump held a rally today at the site of the Coachella music festival. Because just like Trump, Coachella brings out the worst in white people. And maybe it was the 100 degree heat, but it also brought out the weirdest in Trump.</p></blockquote><p>Jost then played a segment from the rally of Trump pointing out someone in the crowd and saying: “Look, it’s Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln, stand up.”</p><p>He continued:</p><blockquote><p>Given your recent history at rallies, do you really want both you and Abraham Lincoln to stand up? It was also reported that during the first three months of her campaign, Kamala Harris raised over $1 billion. Which I hope is finally enough money for her to stop texting me.</p></blockquote><p>Che picked up the thread:</p><blockquote><p>A new poll shows that 47 percent of voters see Kamala Harris representing change better than Donald Trump. “How about now?” said Trump with bangs. Next week, Donald Trump will participate in a Fox News town hall before an all-female audience. Well, good luck trying to talk over all those rape whistles.</p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-7f77ff93">Weekend Update desk segment of the week</h2><p>If your musical palette wasn’t tickled by, say, the parody of “Espresso,” here’s hoping you hung around long enough to catch Nicks’s performance of her white-winged classic, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwEmIxn1ME4&amp;ab_channel=SaturdayNightLive" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Edge of Seventeen.</a>”</p><p>For other audience members who have aged out of the Top 40 chart, there was also this desk segment from Weekend Update, in which Johnson and Sarah Sherman played the squabbling Gallagher siblings of Oasis, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/arts/music/oasis-reunion-tour.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">who recently announced</a> they were reuniting for a 2025 tour.</p><p>As it turned out, the brothers did agree on their favorite Ninja Turtle (Donatello) and their mistaken perception that Jost and Che were twins. As Sherman sang (to the tune of “Wonderwall”), “Well maybe / your mum had Black and white babies.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Dave Itzkoff is a former Times culture reporter.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/dave-itzkoff">More about Dave Itzkoff</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/ariana-grande">Ariana Grande</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/stevie-nicks">Stevie Nicks</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/dana-carvey">Dana Carvey</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore More in TV and Movies</h2><h3>Not sure what to watch next?
