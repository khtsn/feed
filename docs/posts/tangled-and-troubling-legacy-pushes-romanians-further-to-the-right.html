My colleagues don’t hate Jews,” she said. “But they feel that admitting past crimes by people they see as heroes takes away from their national identity.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The episode was one of several abortive efforts in recent years to banish street names, statues and other honors accorded to Romanian fascists of the 1930s and 1940s, some of whom were the country’s best-known writers and intellectuals, celebrated for developing Romanian culture and opposing communism.</p><p>Mircea Vulcanescu, whose name Ms. Mardarovici wanted to remove from the street, was a philosopher, sociologist and economist who, though convicted of war crimes after World War II, is still widely lauded as a luminary of Romanian culture.</p><p>Some of the people honored have been purged, but the survival of others, Ms. Mardarovici said, helps explain how an ultranationalist, Calin Georgescu, managed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/world/europe/romania-election-calin-georgescu.html" title="">rally so much support</a> in a bid to become Romania’s president. He had been well positioned to win a runoff vote last Sunday — until the constitutional court, citing various irregularities, called it off. A date for a new election has yet to be set.</p><p>A little-known independent, Mr. Georgescu won the first round on Nov. 24 by tapping into deep seams of resentment against foreigners, domestic elites, minorities and those seen as tarnishing Romania’s past.</p><p>The surprising cancellation of the second round derailed Mr. Georgescu’s surging campaign but left untouched the forces that had propelled it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Mardarovici said she was “relieved” the court had upended Mr. Georgescu’s presidential campaign, which mixed leftist diatribes against exploitation by foreign corporations with admiring words for past Romanian fascists.</p><p>But, she added: “This will definitely not address our underlying problem. We are going through an identity crisis as a country.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A sign, top left, for Mircea Vulcanescu Street in Bucharest, which is named after a war criminal who played an important role in developing Romania’s identity.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Ruled by the Roman, Russian, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires, the lands that now form Romania became a fully independent state only in 1877, and have been tormented since by what Liviu Rotman, a history professor at the National School for Political Science and Public Administration in Bucharest, called a “siege complex.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Romanians, encircled by the Slavic peoples of Bulgaria, Serbia and Ukraine, have often felt beleaguered. Nationalists have long argued that Romanians arrived in the region long before the Slavs or Hungarians, the country’s biggest minority, tracing their origins back more than two millenniums‌. That has led many Romanians to overlook the unsavory aspects, or crimes, of those contributing to a distinct national culture.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Diana Mardarovici, a Bucharest councilor, at the office of the National Liberal Party this month in Bucharest.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>After the 1989 collapse of communism, punishment meted out against Mr. Vulcanescu and other wartime criminals by the communist regime gave them an “aura as heroes,” said Alexandru Florian, head of the Elie Wiesel National Institute for the Study of the Holocaust in Romania.</p><p>Street names celebrating communists were changed to honor people like Mr. Vulcanescu as Romania looked to the past to assert its national identity.</p><p>Mr. Vulcanescu, who died in a communist-era prison in 1952, is remembered now not as an agent of the Holocaust but as a leading intellectual from the 1930s, a period when many prominent Romanian thinkers embraced extreme nationalism suffused with religious faith. They saw themselves as defending their country against communism and hostile foreign forces working with domestic minorities.</p><p>“Romanian intellectuals were all nationalists, and the whole culture became impregnated with their ideas,” Professor Rotman said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“Cultivated amnesia,” he said, has largely erased memories of where those ideas led during World War II, when Romania allied with Hitler’s Germany. A 2004 report by a commission led by the Romanian-born, Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel estimated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/world/europe/romania-holocaust-survivors-jews-restitution-claims.html" title="">that 280,000 to 380,000 Jews died</a> in Romania and areas under its control during the war.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Romanian intellectuals were all nationalists, and the whole culture became impregnated with their ideas,” said history professor Liviu Rotman.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>That amnesia left many people easily “seduced” by Mr. Georgescu, Professor Rotman said.</p><p>Unlike other prominent and often raucous nationalists in Romania, Mr. Georgescu, a multilingual former agronomist, presented himself as a sober-minded spokesman for ordinary people rooted in the land and the values of the Orthodox Church.</p><p>“Georgescu is not a noisy, vulgar politician, but can actually convince people,” said Oliver Jens Schmitt, a history professor at the University of Vienna. Mr. Schmitt is also the author of a biography of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the founder of Romania’s antisemitic Legionary Movement in the 1930s and its paramilitary wing, the Iron Guard.</p><p>Mr. Georgescu, Mr. Schmitt said, “is an indicator of the extent to which Legionary propaganda has slowly penetrated the Romanian mainstream.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Mr. Georgescu, speaking recently on Romanian TV, dismissed reports of his supporting the Legionary cause as “fake.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Antifascist demonstrators during a protest this month in Bucharest.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>But past statements by Mr. Georgescu dug up by Romanian media outlets after his shock first-round victory show the candidate praising the Legionary Movement and mimicking speeches of Ion Antonescu, Romania’s fascist leader during World War II.</p><p>Public celebration of the Legionary movement is banned. A series of laws and decrees since the early 2000s have made it illegal to honor convicted war criminals or promote hatred against minorities. Teaching about the Holocaust has been mandatory in state schools since last year.</p><p>But that did not stop several dozen extreme nationalists from gathering on Nov. 30 in a forest outside Bucharest to commemorate the anniversary of the 1938 death of the movement’s founder, Mr. Codreanu.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>One of those attending, a 20-year-old university student who gave only his first name, Alexandru, said he had broken up with his girlfriend since she had participated in an antifascist protest. “Why is it bad to be called a Nazi?” he wondered. Prosecutors last week opened a criminal investigation into the forest commemoration.</p><p>Mr. Georgescu, the ultranationalist running for president, has stayed clear of such events. But he has expressed admiration for Mr. Codreanu, describing in 2020 his Legionary movement as “the strongest essence and expression of the health and free will of the Romanian people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pins for sale, including some featuring Mr. Codreanu, during the event celebrating him last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andreea Campeanu for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Many countries in Central and Eastern Europe, where fascist terror before and during World II gave way to communist tyranny after 1945, have rallied to defend war criminals as patriots because they opposed communism.</p><p>Ukraine honors Stepan Bandera, a nationalist responsible for the slaughter of Jews and Poles. Latvia has a remembrance day for members of the Latvia Legion, an arm of the Nazi German Waffen-SS. Many Hungarians revere their own wartime leader, Adm. Miklos Horthy, an ally of Hitler.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>In Romania, while postwar communist leaders, particularly Nicolae Ceausescu, paid lip service to the fight against fascism, they also embraced an ethnic nationalism with often fascist overtones.</p><p>Among other things, Mr. Ceausescu persecuted Hungarians in pursuit of “Romanization” and quietly supported the rehabilitation of the wartime fascist leader, Antonescu, who was executed in 1946.</p><p>Andrei Ursu, the author of books about Mr. Ceausescu’s security service, said Romania’s communist police and intelligence agencies were filled with hard-line nationalists. After the collapse of communism in a bloody revolution in 1989, he said, they promoted the political careers of rabid anti-Semites and xenophobes.
