			<p>In march Sayo can play VCT, so they can start scrimming with him just like TH did it in 2024 with Wo0t when he was 17.</p>
<p>Derke, Sayonara, Sayf, Less.</p>
<p>Sayf can easily do the IGL job, he showed it. Maybe the break was needed just as we saw it with NRG and Ethan. Not look at NRG with Ethan IGLing on attempt 2 -&gt; one of the most dangerous teams.</p>
<p>And I think Vitality also had several issues with the whole team situation. So after the first major where they beat plenty of the big teams (even T1, who later won it) they fell down due to a lack of willpower and organisation.</p>
<p>When Sayf is IGLing and crashies stays with Fnatic, I&#39;m sure a top wanted dude like Lar0k could be a realistic signing. And THAT team would be brutal as hell.</p>
<p>Derke (Duelist)</p>		</div></div>
