And they attacked the Belgian Embassy and the office of the U.N. humanitarian agency in Congo, according to a United Nations official, who referred to the situation as “total chaos.”</p><p>A small fire was also set in front of the Rwandan Embassy.</p><p>The M23 rebels have been fighting against Congolese armed forces and allied armed groups for territorial control in the mineral-rich eastern regions of Congo. Their latest offensive has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/card/2025/01/27/world/africa/photos-rebels-goma-congo" title="">displaced over 500,000 people</a> since the beginning of the year, according to the United Nations’ refugee agency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>As the angry protests erupted in Kinshasa, gunshots rang out across Goma 1,000 miles to the east, an area that was once a refuge for people fleeing M23’s advance and violence from other armed groups. Many are now fleeing again amid the M23 rebels’ fight to completely capture the city.</p><p>Rwanda denies supporting M23. Instead, it has accused Congo of failing to maintain peace in its eastern regions and threatening Rwanda’s own security by amassing troops near their border.</p><p>In a call on Monday with Congo’s president, Félix Tshisekedi, Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the M23 assault on Goma and affirmed the United States’ respect for Congo’s sovereignty, according to Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokeswoman.</p><p>The United Nations Security Council was scheduled to host an emergency meeting about the conflict on Tuesday. After an earlier emergency meeting on Sunday about the conflict, the council’s members did not mention Rwanda by name in their statement condemning the insurgency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The scene as protesters attacked the Rwandan Embassy in Kinshasa on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Samy Ntumba Shambuyi/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Young Haitians’ Lives Disrupted: </strong>Robbed of their education and their prospects for the future, legions of Haitian children are the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/world/americas/haiti-children-schools.html">overlooked victims of the gang violence that has crippled the country</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cracking a Vast Art Fraud: </strong>In a remote Canadian city, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/world/canada/norval-morrisseau-art-fraud.html">a hardened detective and an angry rock star</a> brought down two criminal rings that had produced thousands of fake paintings sold as works by a celebrated Indigenous artist.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drawing a Window Into the Middle East: </strong>The French cartoonist Riad Sattouf’s saga of his parents’ failed bicultural marriage, with its harsh depiction of life in rural Syria, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/world/europe/riad-sattouf-cartoons-france-syria.html">has become a literary sensation</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inside the Gaza Truce Negotiations: </strong>The Qatari prime minister, working with both the Biden administration’s envoy and a representative for Donald Trump, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/world/middleeast/gaza-truce-negotiations.html">formed an unlikely partnership to seal the cease-fire deal</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jair Bolsonaro’s Stay-Out-of-Jail Card: </strong>The former Brazilian president, squeezed by criminal investigations, is looking to Trump, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg to shift his nation’s politics — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-trump-us.html">and maybe keep him a free man</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
