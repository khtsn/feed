For summer travel, late May and late August flights can save travelers 15 to 20 percent on airfare compared to mid-July, when traffic peaks, according to Ms. DeLoache.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Robert Samuel Hanson</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-9dd1f83">Off-Season Travel</h2><p>Would you sacrifice the best weather in a destination for the best price? That’s the prospect of off-season travel, going when the crowds ease usually because of weather or as dictated by school holidays.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In addition to lower airfares and hotel rates, off-season triggers its own specials. For example, several R.V. rental companies offer one-way <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/travel/eastern-canada-rv-road-trip.html" title="">relocation deals</a> to get their vehicles from one destination postseason to the next, often 40 to 60 percent off normal prices and starting as low as $14 a night.</p><p>The rental car company <a href="https://www.hertz.com/rentacar/reservation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hertz</a> regularly offers one-way rentals at up to 50 percent off during transition seasons, including spring rentals from Florida to a number of locations in the North and Mid-Atlantic.</p><p>“It’s really a win-win,” wrote Henry Kuykendall, the executive vice president of North America operations for Hertz, in an email. “Customers get a great deal on one-way journeys while we move our vehicles where they’ll serve customers best.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Robert Samuel Hanson</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-121bad4f">Off-the-Beaten-Path Travel</h2><p>In travel economics, popularity triggers higher prices. If everyone wants to go to Dubrovnik, Croatia, which has a finite number of guest rooms, then the prices for those rooms tend to go up. And if you find long wait times at attractions and restaurants, the quality of the experience tends to go down.</p><p>One way to avoid the beaten-path pinch is to get off it by looking for similarities in less popular places, or “dupes.”</p><p>“These dupes offer similar experiences, landscapes or cultural vibes, allowing travelers to avoid crowds and save money while still enjoying a memorable trip,” wrote Melanie Fish, the vice president of global public relations for Expedia Group Brands, in an email.</p><p>She identified alternatives, including <a href="https://www.visitbatonrouge.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Baton Rouge</a>, La., over New Orleans for a similar cultural spirit but a cheaper cost of living. With its walkable streets, small hotels and culinary scene, <a href="https://www.charlestoncvb.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Charleston</a>, S.C., can sub for Europe and save you money on airfare. (Expedia noted that round-trip airfare to Charleston from New York recently started at $217.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Robert Samuel Hanson</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-7975ed94">Off-Ramp Travel</h2><p>Whether you call it “off-road,” “off-grid” or “offline,” leaving the world behind usually means saving money.</p><p>In the United States, the Bureau of Land Management allows <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/recreation/camping" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dispersed camping</a> — meaning camping apart from developed campgrounds — for free for up to 14 days on its public lands. (Travelers should expect to forgo toilets and running water and adhere to <a href="https://lnt.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Leave No Trace</a> wilderness principles.)</p><p>The federal website <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Recreation.gov</a> manages camping reservations on lands managed by several agencies, including the National Park Service and the B.L.M., which also offers campgrounds.</p><p>Recreation.gov also takes reservations for rustic cabins on Forest Service lands.</p><p>Several camping platforms, including <a href="https://thedyrt.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Dyrt</a>, <a href="https://www.hipcamp.com/en-US" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hipcamp</a> and <a href="https://www.campspot.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Campspot</a>, identify campgrounds, dispersed camping areas and campsites on private lands.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Robert Samuel Hanson</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-32f9969f">Off-Speed Travel</h2><p>Transportation is one of the biggest expenses of a trip. But what if you tried moving at the speed of humans when you got there?</p><p>Slow travel, such as following ancient routes — think of pilgrimage trails like the <a href="https://www.spain.info/en/camino-santiago/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Camino de Santiago</a> in Spain — can offer relatively affordable ways to go for do-it-yourselfers.</p><p>Walking routes that don’t require camping can be a lot easier to find in Europe — hikes in Switzerland range from <a href="https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/experiences/vineyard-walks-in-the-canton-of-vaud/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vineyard ambles</a> to high <a href="https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/experiences/summer-autumn/hiking" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alpine treks</a> — than in North America. But with some planning, walkers can tackle sections of the 1,000-mile-long <a href="https://www.iceagetrail.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ice Age Trail</a> in Wisconsin using <a href="https://www.iceagetrail.org/get-involved/volunteer/chapters/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shuttle services</a> from trailheads to lodgings in local communities arranged in advance with volunteers.</p><p>Going by bike — or bikepacking — allows you to cover more ground. The Adventure Cycling Association offers information on long-distance <a href="https://www.adventurecycling.org/routes-and-maps/interactive-network-map/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bike routes</a> across the country and into Canada. It also offers its own guided <a href="https://www.adventurecycling.org/guided-tours/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">biking trips</a> (a four-day, inn-to-inn trip in <a href="https://www.adventurecycling.org/guided-tours/inn-to-inn-tours/acadia-and-mt-desert-island-long-weekend-inn-to-inn/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maine</a> costs about $1,700) and a list of <a href="https://www.adventurecycling.org/about/advocacy/building-bike-tourism/cyclists-only-lodging/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cyclists-only lodgings</a> found along bike touring routes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Robert Samuel Hanson</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-3d16c8bd">Off-the-Cuff Travel</h2><p>While it may be difficult to find a cheap flight at the last minute, spontaneous lodging and package deals abound.</p><p>The app <a href="https://www.hoteltonight.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HotelTonight</a> offers discounted last-minute lodgings — which range from basic to luxury hotels — in cities from Albuquerque to Zurich.</p><p>Among short-term rental platforms, <a href="https://www.whimstay.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Whimstay</a> offers deals on vacation homes, usually with booking dates within 30 days.</p><p>Online travel agencies often maintain pages devoted to deals on short notice. <a href="https://www.expedia.com/lp/b/vacations/last-minute-deals" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Expedia</a> recently listed a trip to Orlando from Baltimore for $171 a person a night, including airfare and hotel accommodations. <a href="https://www.travelocity.com/lp/deals/last-minute" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Travelocity</a> and the discount retailer <a href="https://www.costcotravel.com/Travel-Offers/Travel-Last-Minute" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Costco</a> also list travel sales.</p><p>Tour companies such as <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/us/last-minute" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Intrepid Travel</a> offer last-minute deals including, recently, a nine-day trip to Bali in June for $772, or about $200 off, not including airfare.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Robert Samuel Hanson</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-3b0353c">Offset Travel</h2><p>In some cases, travelers can trade their sweat equity for free or discounted travel by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/travel/how-to-choose-a-volunteer-trip.html" title="">volunteering</a>.</p><p><a href="https://wwoof.net/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms</a>, for example, offers global farm stays for volunteers who participate in farm work and can use their free time to explore.
