It turned out to be a practice bomb, or a nonexplosive bomb that is used for training but can still be harmful.</p><p>The Wooler Parish Council enlisted Brimstone Site Investigations, a company that specializes in unexploded ordnance, to investigate the site, council officials said in a news release.</p><p>Brimstone arrived on Jan. 23 for what was supposed to be a two-day survey, “but it soon became apparent that the scale of the problem was far greater than anyone had anticipated,” the parish council wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On the first day, Brimstone identified an additional 65 practice bombs, each weighing 10 pounds, as well as smoke cartridges.</p><p>On the second day of work at the site, Brimstone recovered an additional 90 practice bombs and safely removed them to a designated storage area, the council wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Practice bombs that were discovered at Scotts Park playground.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Mather</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The BBC reported that the Ministry of Defense had ordered a full survey of the site.</p><p>Though the bombs are practice bombs, “they do still carry a charge” and require removal by specialists, the parish council’s release said, adding, “These have been found with their fuse and contents still intact — and the detonator burster and smoke filling in particular can still be potentially hazardous.”</p><p>A spokesperson for the Northumberland County Council called the discovery “unexpected.”</p><p>Mark Mather, an official in Wooler, told the BBC that about a third of the park had been cleared and it was possible there were more bombs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It’s quite something to think the children have been playing on bombs,” Mr. Mather said.</p><p>Mr. Mather said that Wooler had been a training center for the Home Guard, a volunteer citizen militia <a href="https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/the-real-dads-army" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">considered the last line of defense</a> against the Germans during World War II.</p><p>“After the war, it looked like they just buried all the ordnance in one of the pits,” Mr. Mather said.</p><p>The Ministry of Defense said that a team had visited the site twice in January, the BBC reported, but it did not offer further details.</p><p>The Wooler Parish Council said it hoped contractors could resume work in April once the site had been declared safe.</p><p>Brimstone, the Ministry of Defense, Mr. Mather, the Wooler Parish Council and the Northumberland County Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
