    <h1>Iran Sent Short-Range Missiles to Russia, U.S. and European Officials Say</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Iran considers the provision of military assistance to the parties engaged in the conflict — which leads to increased human casualties, destruction of infrastructure, and a distancing from cease-fire negotiations — to be inhumane,” the statement said. “Thus, not only does Iran abstain from engaging in such actions itself, but it also calls upon other countries to cease the supply of weapons to the sides involved in the conflict.”</p><p>The Group of 7 nations warned in March that they would impose coordinated sanctions on Iran if it carried out the missile transfer, a warning repeated at a NATO summit meeting in Washington in July.</p><p>Now the question is how Washington and the West will react, a senior European official said.</p><p>With the American presidential campaign in full swing and President Biden a lame duck, the official said, it was not clear how strong Washington’s response would be.</p><p>Mr. Biden has refused Mr. Zelensky’s repeated requests to send Ukraine longer-range missiles that can attack airfields in Russia. From those sites, Russia can attack Ukraine with heavy bombs equipped with fins to glide and GPS packs to ensure accuracy. Ukraine currently does not have missiles with enough range to reach those airfields.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky on Friday went to the Ukraine Contact Group meeting in Ramstein, Germany, to ask for such weapons, and later in the evening, he repeated his plea at a major conference on Europe in Cernobbio, Italy. In those remarks, he pleaded for “air defenses to defend ourselves.” He said that Ukraine would not use any longer-range missiles against civilian targets.</p></div></div>
