The attack left at least 26 civilians dead and over a dozen wounded.</p><p>As officials rush to make sense of the major security lapse in what is one of the world’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/world/asia/kashmir-village-defense-committees.html" title="">most militarized zones</a>, there is growing concern in New Delhi that the pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India to respond decisively could once again raise the specter of cross-border conflict with neighboring Pakistan.</p><p>India and Pakistan have each laid claim to Kashmir since the end of British colonial rule partitioned India into two, carving out Pakistan as an independent nation. Kashmir, where Muslims are a majority, has found itself split between the two, with each country administering a part of it while laying claim to its whole.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>India squarely blames Pakistan for harboring and supporting militants behind attacks like the one on Tuesday. In 2019, a militant attack that killed dozens of Indian security personnel resulted in an air battle between the two nuclear-armed nations that stopped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/world/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir-airstrikes.html" title="">just short of all-out war</a>.</p><p>“The whole idea, I think, behind this attack was to sort of puncture that narrative that, you know, everything is fine,” said D.S. Hooda, a retired Indian army general who led Indian’s northern command based in Kashmir. <strong>“</strong>The government will be under tremendous pressure to react.”</p><p>General Hooda said the fact that the victims were civilians, and that witness accounts in Indian media suggested Hindus had been singled out by the militants, had only added to the pressure. A list of the victims circulating online, which was verified by local officials in Kashmir, showed that 25 of the 26 killed were Hindus.</p><p>The targeting of Hindus by militants in the 1990s forced an exodus of the minority community from the region. In the apparently targeted killings on Tuesday, many saw reminders that region still remains unsafe, particularly for the Hindu minority, despite the government’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/world/asia/kashmir-india-tourism.html" title="">claim of a return to normalcy</a>.</p><p>Videos and images of the carnage flooded Indian media after the attack, showing tourists who were taking in the vast beauty one hour lying in pools of blood the next. One viral image showed a young woman in a beige jacket visibly distraught, kneeling down next to the lifeless body of a man.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The attack struck as Vice President JD Vance and his family were in India on a four-day visit. In a condolence message on social media, Mr. Vance described the assault as a “devastating terrorist attack.”</p><p>Mr. Modi, who was on a two-day visit to Saudi Arabia, cut his trip short and returned home. He will chair a cabinet security meeting later on Wednesday, Indian news media reported.</p><p>Schools were shut in much of Kashmir on Wednesday, and security was tightened, with military helicopters surveilling the valley where the terror was unleashed. Tourists were also rushing to leave the region, as airlines added additional flights.</p><p>“It’s heartbreaking to see the exodus of our guests from the valley after yesterday’s tragic terror attack in Pahalgam,” Omar Abdullah, Kashmir’s top elected official, said. “But at the same time, we totally understand why people would want to leave.”</p><p>Amit Shah, India’s home minister, who arrived in Kashmir in the hours after the attack, met with the surviving victims and paid his respects to those killed in front of rows of coffins draped in white.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The culprits of this dastardly terror attack will not be spared,” Mr. Shah said.</p><p>In recent years, Mr. Modi had taken a two-pronged approach to managing Kashmir: ignore and isolate a Pakistan that was already teetering because of its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/asia/pakistan-protests-politics.html" title="">own domestic problems</a>, and tighten security at home.</p><p>In 2019, Mr. Modi stripped Kashmir of the semi-autonomy it had enjoyed, and dissolved its local democracy to bring it under direct rule from New Delhi. While small-scale attacks against civilians continued, Mr. Modi’s officials were increasingly projecting that their strategy was working. Kashmir had turned a page, they said, and it could focus on development. The main indicator of progress was the rising number of tourists pouring into the beautiful valley from different parts of the country.</p><p>The mass-casualty attack on Tuesday has exposed the limits of that strategy.</p><p>Suhasini Raj<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mujib Mashal is the South Asia bureau chief for The Times, helping to lead coverage of India and the diverse region around it, including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Santa’s Neighbors Are Annoyed: </strong>A tourist season in Rovaniemi, Finland that stretches from October to March has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/asia/santa-finland-rovaniemi.html">anything but jolly for some residents</a> of the “Official Hometown of Santa Claus.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Orange Skies in Iraq: </strong>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/middleeast/iraq-sandstorm.html">severe sandstorm swept across Iraq</a>, turning the sky a strange orange, reducing visibility and sending several thousand people to emergency rooms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Van Gogh’s Last Painting: </strong>The artist painted his final work, “Tree Roots,” in Auvers-sur-Oise, France.
