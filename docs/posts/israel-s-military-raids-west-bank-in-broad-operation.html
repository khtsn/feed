The Palestinian Health Ministry said at least nine people had been killed in the attacks, and Israel’s foreign minister suggested that some residents of the West Bank would need to be evacuated.</p><p>The foreign minister, Israel Katz, said Israel’s military had started an operation in Jenin and Tulkarm to thwart terrorist groups. “We must deal with the threat just as we deal with the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza, including the temporary evacuation of Palestinian residents and whatever steps are required,” he <a href="https://x.com/Israel_katz/status/1828654399360586025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted on social media</a>.</p><p>The comments suggested the start of a significant escalation in Israel’s military campaign in the West Bank, which has ramped up since the war in Gaza began. While 90 percent of Gaza’s population of more than two million people have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/02/world/middleeast/gaza-map-displaced-people.html" title="">forced to leave their homes</a>, residents of the West Bank have not endured the scale of bombardments, raids and evacuation orders that Gazans have in the past 10 months of war.</p><p>The Israeli military <a href="https://x.com/idfonline/status/1828555341065527453" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> it was carrying out counterterrorism operations in Tulkarm and in Jenin, without providing details. The operations appeared to be occurring elsewhere in the West Bank as well. The Palestinian Health Ministry said that seven of the people had been killed in Tubas, in addition to two in Jenin, and that 11 others had been injured.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Wafa, the Palestinian Authority’s official news agency, said that Israeli troops had moved in on hospitals, hindering ambulances at one medical facility, and were bulldozing infrastructure in Jenin and Tulkarm.</p><p>Israeli forces blocked access in and out of Jenin and Tulkarm early Wednesday, and large numbers of military vehicles entered Jenin, Wafa reported.</p><p>On Monday, the Israeli military carried out an airstrike on the densely populated Nur Shams area in the West Bank, killing at least five people whom it described <a href="https://x.com/idfonline/status/1828637568096747904" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement on Wednesday</a> as terrorists. The military said that one of those killed in that strike was a man who had been released in November as part of a prisoner exchange.</p><p>Since the war in Gaza began last Oct. 7, more than 600 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, according to the United Nations. The U.N. humanitarian coordinator <a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-207-west-bank" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">also said</a> Israeli forces had demolished, confiscated or forced the demolition of more than 1,400 structures across the West Bank since then.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Gabby Sobelman is a reporter and researcher, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs, based in Rehovot, Israel.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gabby-sobelman">More about Gabby Sobelman</a></span></p></div><div><p>Victoria Kim is a reporter based in Seoul and focuses on breaking news coverage across the world.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/victoria-kim">More about Victoria Kim</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">Israel-Hamas War News</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/the-palestinian-authority">The Palestinian Authority</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Israel-Hezbollah Tensions:</strong> Amid fears of an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, the two sides mounted the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-hamas-gaza-iran.html">biggest round of cross-border strikes</a> since the war in Gaza began.
