don’t count Europe out.</p><p>That was the pitch that President Emmanuel Macron of France made on Monday as Paris hosted an A.I. summit, where government leaders, top tech executives and academic experts have gathered to discuss the hopes surrounding A.I., as well as the fears of economic and societal disruption that the rapidly evolving technology has fueled.</p><p>“We are back in the race,” Mr. Macron said under the soaring steel and glass roof of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/arts/design/grand-palais-paris-history.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">Grand Palais</a>, the exhibition hall where France and India have teamed up to hold the summit.</p><p>Mr. Macron said it was crucial to develop artificial intelligence that was “at the service of humanity” and regulated to guard from dangerous pitfalls. But he also urged Europe to cut red tape, foster more A.I. start-ups and invest in computing abilities. Often, he said, Europe is too slow for investors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We will simplify,” Mr. Macron said. “At the national and European scale, it is very clear that we have to resynchronize with the rest of the world.”</p><p>Attendees at the summit, which runs through Tuesday, include Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI; Zhang Guoqing, China’s vice premier; and Vice President JD Vance, who is on his first trip overseas.</p><p>France sees the summit as a crucial moment to spur A.I. investment in Europe, to get consumers on board with the fast-moving technology and to position Europe as a top contender — not just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/08/technology/eu-ai-act-regulation.html?searchResultPosition=8" title="">a leading regulator</a> — in a global competition where the United States and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/world/asia/china-deepseek-education.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">China</a> are so far the biggest players.</p><p>“We want to take advantage of this summit to leverage and go faster,” said Mr. Macron, who extolled what he called the “Notre-Dame strategy” — named after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/europe/notre-dame-paris-france.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">successful reconstruction</a> of the French capital’s fire-ravaged cathedral on a tight five-year deadline.</p><p>“We showed the rest of the world that, when we commit to a clear timeline, we can deliver,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At similar gatherings in other countries, the focus was often on A.I.’s potential risks in terms of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/special-series/ai-transform-global-economy.html?searchResultPosition=5" title="">economic upheaval</a>, disinformation and national security — like a 2023 summit in Britain <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/world/europe/uk-ai-summit-sunak.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">that warned of the technology’s potentially “catastrophic” harm</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Emmanuel Macron of France, second right, meeting with China’s vice premier, Zhang Guoqing, second left, at the A.I. summit in Paris.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Mohammad Badra</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Those concerns remain. “So much of the last decade has been a story of technology tearing us apart,” Fei-Fei Li, a professor of computer science at Stanford and co-director at the university’s Human-Centered A.I. Institute, said in the summit’s opening comments. “A.I. is at another fork in this road.”</p><p>Christy Hoffman, the general secretary of the UNI Global Union, said that “there is a risk of A.I. turning into another engine of inequality, and people are concerned that it will further reduce their autonomy or replace them altogether.”</p><p>But the global mood has shifted as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/health/ai-patient-messages-mychart.html" title="">A.I. becomes widespread</a> and countries jostle to build the technology’s next giant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Last month, President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/technology/trump-openai-stargate-artificial-intelligence.html" title="">announced</a> the so-called Stargate initiative, which could eventually invest as much as $500 billion over the next four years in computing infrastructure to power A.I. And China shocked the tech world with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/technology/deepseek-china-ai-chips.html" title="">DeepSeek</a>, a company that developed powerful artificial intelligence at a fraction of the cost of its American counterparts.</p><p>“If we want growth, jobs and progress, we have to allow innovators to innovate, builders to build and developers to develop,” Mr. Altman <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2025/02/08/sam-altman-pdg-d-openai-sur-l-intelligence-artificielle-la-france-a-mis-en-place-une-strategie-que-d-autres-pays-europeens-devraient-suivre_6537698_3232.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in an opinion essay</a> in the French newspaper Le Monde on Saturday. “The risk of inaction is too great to ignore.”</p><p>(The New York Times has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" title="">sued</a> OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit’s claims.)</p><p>Mr. Macron’s priority is ensuring that Europe does not fall behind the United States and China by overregulating its development.</p><p>He acknowledged the need for regulation — for instance, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/arts/music/record-labels-ai-lawsuit-sony-universal-warner.html?searchResultPosition=8" title="">protect intellectual property</a> — but also pitched the benefits of A.I., calling it “a formidable technological and scientific revolution for progress.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“If we regulate before we innovate, we won’t have any innovation of our own,” Mr. Macron <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaew18GQyac" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told France 2 television</a> on Sunday.</p><p>Investors at the conference shared his view, but warned that Europe was not as competitive as the United States or China because it had layers of regulations, higher taxes and fewer financial incentives.</p><p>France, Mr. Macron argued, is well positioned to lead Europe’s A.I. push, partly because it gets about 70 percent of its electricity from nuclear energy, allowing it to support power-hungry data centers without jeopardizing its climate change goals.</p><p>“I have a good friend on the other side of the ocean that says, ‘Drill, baby, drill,’” Mr. Macron said, referring to Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/business/energy-environment/trump-oil-gas.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">pledge</a> to make it easier to secure oil drilling leases in the United States. “Here there is no need to drill — it’s ‘plug, baby, plug.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Mr. Macron announced more than 100 billion euros in A.I.-related investments in France during the summit, including <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/02/06/uae-to-invest-billions-in-france-ai-data-center_6737871_7.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a deal</a> with the United Arab Emirates to fund an A.I. data center and campus in France.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Inside the Paris office of Mistral, France’s leading A.I. start-up.

It is one of more than 60 companies that have joined an <a href="https://aichampions.eu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">E.U. A.I. Champions Initiative</a> calling on Europe to become an A.I. global leader.</p><p>As one of the world’s biggest defense equipment makers, Airbus has increasingly integrated A.I. into its defense applications, raising ethical questions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>At the summit, Guillaume Faury, Airbus’s chief executive, acknowledged that “things are moving so fast,” but said global leaders needed to make sure that A.I. “has to be good for society.”</p><p>That includes not letting A.I. take the driver’s seat, he added. “Keeping the human in the loop for us is essential — having someone who’s a human being be accountable,” Mr. Faury said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aurelien Breeden is a reporter for The Times in Paris, covering news from France.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aurelien-breeden">More about Aurelien Breeden</a></span></p></div><div><p>Liz Alderman is the chief European business correspondent, writing about economic, social and policy developments around Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liz-alderman">More about Liz Alderman</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/emmanuel-macron">Emmanuel Macron</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/openai">OpenAI</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/sam-altman">Sam Altman</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/02/10/business/ai-summit-paris.html">3</a></span></p></div></span></p><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/02/10/business/ai-summit-paris.html">3</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Coverage of Artificial Intelligence</h2><hr/><p><strong>News</strong><strong> and Analysis</strong></p><ul><li><p>An apparent breakthrough in efficiency from the Chinese start-up DeepSeek did not make tech’s biggest companies question their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/technology/deepseek-data-centers-ai.html">extravagant spending on new A.I. data centers</a>.</p></li><li><p>OpenAI is set to complete a $40 billion fund-raising deal that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/technology/openai-softbank-investment.html">nearly doubles the high-profile company’s valuation</a> from just four months ago.</p></li><li><p>After the arrival of a less costly A.I. model from China, U.S. markets and academics are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/business/ai-deepseek-nvidia-tesla.html">wrestling with the ultimate economic value of the technology</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>The Age of A.I.</strong></p><ul><li><p>Most large employers play down the likelihood that A.I. bots will take our jobs. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/business/klarna-ceo-ai.html">Then there’s Klarna</a>, a darling of tech investors.</p></li><li><p>Venture capitalists plowed billions of dollars into A.I. start-ups like OpenAI and Anthropic.
