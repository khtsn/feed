Last November, the Netherlands gave Geert Wilders’s far-right anti-Islam Party for Freedom <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/world/europe/dutch-elections-far-right-wilders.html" title="">a significant victory at ballot boxes</a>, leading to a new government four months later.</p><p>In Austria Mr. Kickl campaigned on a strong anti-immigrant platform, denigrating migrants in Austria as criminals and welfare sponges. He has called for a temporary halt in accepting new asylum seekers and a law that would ban asylum seekers from becoming Austrian citizens. The Freedom Party, which was founded in the 1950s by former members of the SS, was part of the government until 2019. Mr. Kickl was interior minister, responsible for borders and intelligence services.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>President Alexander Van der Bellen of Austria has said that he will not swear in a government under Mr. Kickl. The coming days and weeks will show whether Mr. Van der Bellen will ask Chancellor Nehammer to start coalition negotiations.</p><p>According to official preliminary tallies, the far-right Freedom Party of Austria got 29.2 percent of the vote and the conservative People’s Party 26.5 percent. The Social Democrats got 21.1 percent, their lowest ever in a federal election, while the liberal NEOS got 9 percent and the Greens, which are part of the current government, received 8 percent of the vote.</p><p>On Sunday, Mr. Nehammer declined to speculate about coalition parties, but given the new distribution of seats, his party could form a coalition with the Social Democrats and possibly a third partner, like the liberal NEOS.</p><p>The governing People’s Party lost 11 percentage points compared with the last election in 2019, when the chancellor at the time, Sebastian Kurz, won convincingly. Since then the party has weathered a scandal over influence-buying and corruption that led to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/17/world/europe/austria-sebastian-kurz-scandal-chancellor.html" title="">Mr. Kurz’s stepping down</a> and leaving politics.</p><p>“This election result perfectly embodies the paradox of Austrian politics: an incredible amount is shifting, but at the same time nothing changes,” said Laurenz Ennser-Jedenastik, a professor of Austrian politics at the University of Vienna, whose research focuses on political parties.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Christopher F.
