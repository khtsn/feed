    <h1>Russia Suspends Flow of Natural Gas to Europe Through Ukraine</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Europe has sharply reduced its consumption of Russian gas since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago, with volumes through the Ukrainian transit pipeline falling to around a quarter of what they were before the war.</p><p>Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and several Balkan countries still rely on Russian gas delivered through Ukraine, but experts say gas in storage facilities and alternative supplies should prevent any immediate disruptions to electricity and heating in these countries.</p><p>More vulnerable is Moldova. In December it declared a state of emergency amid fears that an end to supplies of Russian gas through Ukraine would endanger its main source of electricity, a gas-fueled power plant in the breakaway Russian-speaking region of Transnistria.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/world/europe/moldova-russia-transnistria.html" title="">Transnistria</a>, a sliver of Moldovan territory next to Ukraine, with support from Moscow, declared itself an independent microstate after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has been threatening to shut down the pipeline despite threats of retaliation, including from Slovakia and Hungary, two of the European countries that most depend on Russian gas.</p></div></div>
