The Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce estimates that 80 percent of jobs in the country are in the informal sector, with low pay and little security.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Buying produce with a U.S. dollar in Harare, Zimbabwe’s capital.

The United States has imposed sanctions on members of the country’s ruling elite, including Mr. Mnangagwa.</p><p>Mr. Mnangagwa, 82, promised democratic and economic reforms when he helped to overthrow Robert Mugabe, an autocrat in power for 37 years, in 2017. Instead, he has failed to harness the country’s wealth of critical minerals into an economic boom.</p><p>He also fired Zimbabwe’s army chief, Anselem Sanyatwe, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/zimbabwe-president-fires-army-chief-ahead-planned-protests-2025-03-26/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ahead of the planned nationwide</a> protests on Monday. The shake-up follows the removal of the chief of police and head of Zimbabwe’s intelligence service — moves that political analysts widely view as an effort to protect Mr. Mnangagwa against a military takeover.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Zimbabweans — who have fled the country by the hundreds of thousands over the past two decades — continue to leave in droves, fomenting animosity among neighboring countries feeling the strain of growing migrant populations.</p><p>“Zimbabwe is saying Mugabe was better — that is how bad the situation is,” said Ntokozo Msipha, a ZANU-PF member who has helped organize the protests against Mr. Mnangagwa. “We should have done this earlier.”</p><p>Those leading the charge against Mr. Mnangagwa accuse him of trying to extend his rule beyond the end of his second term in 2028. His opponents say he previously promised to hand over power to his vice president, Constantino Chiwenga.</p><p>Earlier this year, the governing party said it would amend the Constitution so Mr. Mnangagwa could run for a third term in 2028.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Chiwenga, a decorated army general, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/world/africa/zimbabwe-mugabe-general-military-purge.html" title="">was an architect of the coup</a> that toppled Mr. Mugabe.

Mr. Geza went into hiding this month after party officials accused him of treason.</p><p>In a news conference last week, Mr. Geza called on the president “to go or face being removed.”</p><p>Tafadzwa Mugwadi, a ZANU-PF member of Parliament, dismissed Mr. Geza and his faction of disgruntled war veterans within the party as having no credibility.</p><p>“I have no record of any internal factional fights,” Mr. Mugwadi said. “I don’t understand his authority.”</p><p>Even as his supporters brush off critics, Mr. Mnangagwa seemed to be leaving nothing to chance.</p><p>The police presence was heavy across the capital, Harare, on Friday last week. Officers clutching batons roamed Africa Unity Square Park, a well-known protest site, as people ate food on the lawn and lounged on benches.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>At a roadblock in Mabvuku, just outside Harare, the police searched vehicles, telling motorists that they were looking for weapons and acting on the government’s instructions to prevent violent protesters.</p><p>After getting his car searched, Gilbert Tapfumaneyi said he would return to town on Monday without his vehicle to join the protests. Mr. Tapfumaneyi, a car salesman, said he did not make enough money to buy gas.</p><p>“We have suffered enough,” he said.</p><p>Many workers in central Harare stayed home on Monday out of fear of violence breaking out at the protests. Others said they had little choice but to go to work.</p><p>“I have mouths to feed back home,” said Belinda Chisewu, a roadside vendor selling cellphone credit, adding that she had three children.</p><p>The ZANU-PF infighting may have less to do with the challenges faced by ordinary citizens and more to do with a battle over state power and resources, political analysts said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Rashweat Mukundu, a Zimbabwe-based media researcher and rights activist, said the divisions within the party were comparable to what happened in the Mugabe era.</p><p>“What we are seeing is a similar pattern of the ruling party failing to manage its transition,” he said. “An incumbent perhaps wanting to be an imperial president and stay in power until death, and that always agitates those who have political aspirations.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Driving in Singapore: </strong>The city-state, where it costs up to $84,000 just for the right to own a car, is one of the most expensive places to drive. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/asia/car-certificate-singapore-luxury.html">That is by design</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Radio Martí Goes Off the Air: </strong>For four decades, a U.S.-financed broadcaster <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/americas/radio-marti-cuba-trump-castro.html">provoked the ire of the communist government</a> in Cuba.
