    <h1>Bruce Springsteen Will Release Seven ‘Lost Albums’ in June</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“LA Garage Sessions ’83” has 18 songs from the period when Springsteen was developing “Born in the U.S.A.,” his monster 1984 hit, a moment of transition from the raw solo demos that were released as “Nebraska” (1982). Many of those titles, like “Fugitive’s Dream” and “Don’t Back Down on Our Love,” have long circulated among fans as bootlegs, but are getting their first official release on “Tracks II.”</p><p>“Streets of Philadelphia Sessions” peels back the curtain on another phase of Springsteen’s career. After using synthesizers and a drum machine to record “Streets of Philadelphia,” a solo song for Jonathan Demme’s 1993 film “Philadelphia” — which went on to win best original song at the Academy Awards — Springsteen continued to experiment with the format, and word filtered out about a dark LP with a “<a href="https://www.springsteenlyrics.com/lyrics.php?song=waitingontheendoftheworld" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hip-hop edge</a>.” But even after fully preparing it for release, Springsteen opted to hold the album back.</p><p>In “Born to Run,” his 2016 memoir, Springsteen said he decided that the lyrics on the album, about troubled relationships, were not fully realized, and that he had grown concerned about “a faint disconnect with my audience” from previous albums, like “Tunnel of Love,” from 1987, that had explored similar themes. “I had to come to terms with the fact that after my year of work, writing, recording, mixing,” he added, “it was going on the shelf. That’s where she sits.”</p><p>Now that 10-track LP is finally coming out.</p><p>The other album collections in “Tracks II” include “Faithless,” from a film project that was never made; the country-inflected “Somewhere North of Nashville”; “Inyo,” with songs like “Ciudad Juarez” and “The Aztec Dance” that hint at Mexican culture and America’s southern border; and “Twilight Hours,” a rare example of orchestrated, traditional-pop Springsteen. He describes the last album, “Perfect World,” as “the one thing on this that wasn’t initially conceived as an album,” but rather “something I put together.”</p></div></div>
