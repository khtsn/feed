A sea of people crossed the bridge to Paiporta, where mud still clogged the streets after a river burst its banks.</p><p>In urban Valencia, the city’s celebrated soccer club offered Mestalla Stadium as an emergency center where citizens could drop off bags of food, clothes and bottles of water. City officials and volunteers also set up a food bank, serving food along the stadium’s main entrance.</p><p>“The image of Mestalla filled with people coming together, arriving to donate products, and applauding each time a truck leaves full of food and basic necessities, will be unforgettable,” Javier Solís, the club’s corporate director, said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Alongside star players like José Gayà and Jaume Doménech, fans and volunteers sorted and packed food destined for devastated neighborhoods. Candela Reig Moril, an industrial engineering student who lives in central Valencia, helped coordinate university students who wanted to help, and ended up working with hundreds of people who wanted to do something for their city.</p><p>“Many of them come crying because of this huge, unexpected catastrophe,” Ms. Reig Moril, 21, said. “The little children have even come to deliver their toys. It’s very touching to see everybody so willing to show solidarity.”</p><p>Volunteers have used social media or <a href="https://ayudadana.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">message boards</a> set up in response to the disaster to find out how they can help. They have offered beds for displaced families or shelter for pets and have volunteered their professional skills, from logistics management to cooking.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Two women clean inside a kitchen as volunteers help residents with recovery efforts after the flood, in Massanassa, just outside of Valencia, on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alberto Saiz/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Claudia Orts García, a nursing assistant, used a message board to collect food, medication and feminine hygiene products. On Sunday, she and her partner plan to drive from Dénia, a port town south of Valencia city, to the worst affected areas, where they will deliver the donated supplies. Some friends who also wanted to help have asked to ride along. Ms. Orts García said she will also offer medical assistance where possible.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“We will lend a hand in everything that is necessary,” she said.</p><p>Amid the rush to help those in need, there was also a wave of criticism directed at the Spanish government. Parts of Valencia were doused in a year’s worth of rain in just eight hours, and some said government warnings <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/world/europe/spain-floods-blame.html" title="">came too late</a>. Other victims said rescue workers and the police <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/world/europe/spain-rain-floods.html" title="">took too long</a> to respond to the disaster. Dozens were still missing by Saturday. </p><p>For Toni Zamorano, who was trapped on the roof of his car for hours as rain fell, the volunteers have become a lifeline. In the town of Sedaví, houses and businesses were completely flooded. Mr. Zamorano said he has lost everything.</p><p>Were it not for the volunteers who work from sunrise to sunset, he would not have clothes, food and water, he said. Not only have the volunteers provided the basic necessities, they have also restored his faith in humanity, he said.</p><p>“I feel that humanity is still capable of forgetting its differences. Here, race or economic level don’t matter,” he said. “This solidarity makes you feel great, then you close your eyes when you sleep, you remember everything you have seen and you understand the magnitude of this tragedy.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lynsey Chutel is a Times reporter based in London who covers breaking news in Africa, the Middle East and Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lynsey-chutel">More about Lynsey Chutel</a></span></p></div><div><p>Amelia Nierenberg is a breaking news reporter for The Times in London, covering international news<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/amelia-nierenberg">More about Amelia Nierenberg</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>5</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>After Deadly Floods in Spain, Thousands Mobilize to Help Out, and Vent<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/valencia-cf-soccer-team">Valencia CF (Soccer Team)</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/11/03/world/europe/spain-floods-valencia-volunteers.html">74</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/11/03/world/europe/spain-floods-valencia-volunteers.html">74</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
