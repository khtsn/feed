To date, the response of Greenland’s leaders has been polite but firmly opposed, stating it was not for sale.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/us/politics/usha-vance-trump-us-greenland.html" title="">this week&#39;s visits</a> from Usha Vance, the second lady, and Mike Waltz, the national security adviser, have elicited a more agitated response. Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede told <a href="https://www.sermitsiaq.ag/samfund/jens-frederik-vigtigt-at-vi-ikke-gar-i-panik/2212222" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sermitsiaq, a local newspaper</a>, that their expected arrival, little more than two weeks after Greenland held parliamentary elections, is “highly aggressive,” and “the only purpose is to demonstrate power over us.” </p><p>He also said he feared that the visit would drum up fervor in the United States for a takeover of Greenland, “and the pressure will increase after the visit.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>So why is Mr. Trump so determined to have Greenland? Here’s a window into his thinking.</p><h2 id="link-175ccf7a">Greenland is in strategically important territory.</h2><p>Most of Greenland lies within the Arctic Circle, a region that the world’s powers are vying for over for its untapped natural resources and its proximity to emerging shipping corridors that would accelerate global trade. Already, melting Arctic ice has transformed the region that was once largely unnavigable into an area of competitive commerce, <a href="https://arctic-council.org/news/increase-in-arctic-shipping/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as more ships</a> traverse the Arctic Circle and countries with land in the region scramble to lay claim to as much of the seabed as possible.</p><p>Routes between Asia and Europe, or Asia and the United States, are about 40 percent shorter through the Arctic than either the Suez or Panama Canals, <a href="https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2013/july/cold-hard-realities-arctic-shipping" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> the U.S. Naval Institute. That makes the question of who controls the seas there critical for both financial and security purposes, especially given the claimants also happen to be rival geopolitical superpowers.</p><p>Only five countries can claim to have an extended continental shelf into the Arctic: Canada, Russia, Norway, Denmark via Greenland, and the United States via Alaska. Acquiring Greenland would give the United States a significantly bigger claim in the Arctic.</p><h2 id="link-3ce78e1">Trump has said it is vital for national security.</h2><p>“We need Greenland for national security and even international security,” Mr. Trump said in March during an address to Congress, adding the territory was “very, very important for military security.”</p><p>The United States has had troops in Greenland since World War II, and keeps a small missile defense base there called Pituffik Space Base — formerly Thule Air Base, before Mr. Trump redesignated it during his first administration. It is possible that base could become part of the <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/4127682/dods-acquisition-community-already-working-on-golden-dome-big-team-effort-requi/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Golden Dome” missile defense</a> system, modeled after Israel’s Iron Dome system, that Mr. Trump has said he wants to build to protect the entirety of the United States from potential threats from adversaries, especially China. In an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/the-iron-dome-for-america/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a>, Mr. Trump gave Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, until March 28 to produce the plans for that missile defense shield.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But there are market-based threats Mr. Trump wants to protect against as well. Russia and China are already cooperating on Arctic shipping routes, and with Russia’s extensive presence in the region — it has the largest area of Arctic coastline — that partnership threatens to remain the dominant economic force in the area.</p><h2 id="link-d4a4224">Greenland could be a rich source for rare earth minerals and energy.</h2><p>According to the <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/70035000" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. Geological Survey</a>, the Arctic holds 13 percent of undiscovered gas resources and 30 percent of undiscovered natural gas, most of it offshore. Controlling Greenland would give the United States an expanded claim to those seabed resources.</p><p>But Greenland also uniquely boasts huge stores of rare earth minerals that are vital to the production of batteries, cellphones, electric vehicles and other technology — and the Trump administration has been looking globally to augment its rare earth mineral holdings.</p><p>Rare earth minerals have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/ukraine-mineral-deal-trump.html" title="">a key part</a> of an agreement that the United States has been trying to strike with Ukraine. Greenland’s stores of cobalt, nickel, copper, lithium, zirconium and other minerals have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/world/europe/greenland-minerals-trump.html" title="">proven challenging to mine</a>, but there is another incentive for the United States to seek to control that market: China.</p><p>Currently, China dominates the world’s raw mineral market, and has already attempted to make inroads in Greenland. Acquiring the territory would allow Mr. Trump to check Beijing’s efforts to exploit minerals there and expand America’s holdings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-4502e02b">Climate change could soon make Greenland a hot commodity.</h2><p>Part of the reason it has been difficult to exploit Greenland’s resources to date is that it is so darn cold. But with climate change, melting ice is creating new opportunities for resource exploitation. In the last 30 years, about 11,000 square miles of ice sheet have melted, an area about the size of Maryland.</p><p>Denmark has also <a href="https://eng.geus.dk/about/news/news-archive/2023/june/great-potential-for-critical-raw-materials-in-greenland" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recognized the potential</a> of Greenland’s resources to be vital in the global transition to greener forms of energy. For the local population, the potential for an economic boom from mining is seen as helpful in its bid for independence, which a <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/virtually-no-greenlander-wants-to-join-the-us-poll-finds/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">majority of the population</a> wants.</p><p>But the development of the industry has been slow. Greenland has taken steps to limit the potential for environmentally destructive mining practices through laws, including a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/greenland-bans-uranium-mining-halting-rare-earths-project-2021-11-10/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ban on uranium</a> mining in 2021. But those could be overturned if the United States acquires the territory.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Musk Effect:</strong> Elon Musk is seemingly everywhere, dominating the news out of Washington and beyond.
