But at a news conference, John Chell, the chief of patrol of the New York Police Department, described it as a targeted attack. The gunman, whom Mr. Chell described as a man in his 20s, remained at large as of Monday afternoon.</p><p>It was another conspicuous episode of violence to occur alongside the event in recent years, but, soon afterward, the parade, an annual celebration of emancipation from enslavement, continued along with its festive music, colorful outfits and decorative floats.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Adrianalee Watson, 15, said she was selling bracelets with her mother on Monday when they heard the gunshots and ran into a nearby building for safety. Ms. Watson said she also heard shots fired at the parade last year. On Monday, after ambulances took the victims away, she returned to her spot on Eastern Parkway and resumed her business.</p><p>“It’s a fun experience, even though you do have people who ruin the fun,” she said. “You’ve just got to be safe about it. You’ve got to have a place where you can go if anything bad happens, and you’ve just got to be aware of your surroundings.”</p><p>Many attendees seemed unaware of the incident at the crowded event, where revelers in bright colors marched and danced.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Natalie Keyssar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Natalie Keyssar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>J’Ouvert, from the French words “jour ouvert,” meaning daybreak or morning, is the early-morning event that precedes the bigger procession. It began at 6 a.m. near Grand Army Plaza and flowed into the parade.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“We have old people, young people, those in the middle of the way,” said Gail Yvette Davis, a 71-year-old attendee. “It’s generally a family kind of thing that happens.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Many parade-goers dress in brightly colored costumes as part of celebrating emancipation from enslavement.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Natalie Keyssar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Once inside the parade, people browsed jewelry, clothing and various delicacies, like sliced mango, Marinos ices and nets of green mamoncillo, a small green fruit.

Andrew Cuomo, was fatally shot when he was caught in a crossfire during J’Ouvert. The following year, two more people were shot dead at the events, and there were other reports of shootings and stabbings at or near the event.</p><p>On Friday, Police Department officials said officers would patrol the entire 1.6-mile parade route and issued 300 security wands to check every attendee for concealed weapons at the parade’s entry points, police officials said at a <a href="https://x.com/NYPDnews/status/1829568237945954500" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news conference</a> on Friday. Six drone teams were set to be deployed to monitor the crowd and coordinate with other city agencies to curb underage drinking, the officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Many inside the parade were not aware a shooting had occurred.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Natalie Keyssar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Jeffrey Maddrey, the chief of department, said crime had fallen significantly since the days when he patrolled J’Ouvert and the parade in the early 2000s.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“I was ripping and running around all night, from scene to scene, shooting to shooting,” Chief Maddrey said at the news conference.</p><p>On Monday, police vans followed J’Ouvert attendees closely as they danced to the beat of steel drums on floats along Nostrand Avenue, which was lined with metal barricades and rows of police officers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-17"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Natalie Keyssar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Natalie Keyssar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Some of the floats promoted local businesses and social causes. The Queer Caribbean Liberation Collective supported the Guyanese transgender community and chanted various demands. “Justice for Caribbean L.G.B.T.Q. people,” they shouted. “None of us are free until we are all free.”</p><p>Some J’Ouvert attendees were covered in bright splatters of paint that had dried long before. Others marched and danced, still applying green paint squirted through punctured water bottles and tossing handfuls of colorful powder from plastic sachets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Some performers wore stilts, elaborate gowns and the feathered costumes that are often associated with the parade. Competing music systems pounded out reggae, soca, calypso and dance hall, while coolers brimmed with mojitos and rum punches along with mauby, a tree-bark based beverage, and juices flavored with sorrel.</p><p>Local officials including Attorney General Letitia James marched with the crowd, along with floats representing Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul.</p><p>Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, participated as well. Afterward, he posted on X that he was pained by the shooting.</p><p>“I pray for everyone affected,” he wrote. “We must keep working to end gun violence in America.”</p><p>Chelsia Rose Marcius<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>17</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Shooting Mars Festivities at Brooklyn West Indian American Day Parade<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
