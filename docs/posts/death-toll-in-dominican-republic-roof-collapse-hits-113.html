With each news update, the body count climbed.</p><p>“We have the same number of transfers to the hospital as 3 p.m. yesterday: 155,” Mr. Méndez said, stressing that the ambulances often carried more than one person.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It was unclear how many people were still missing. There has been no official announcement of how many people were inside the club at the time of the roof collapse.</p><p>Mr. Méndez had vowed to continue searching until the very last person is recovered. A large-scale operation was underway for a second day, with hundreds of rescue workers from various agencies at the nightclub site.</p><p>The director of the National Police, Ramón Guzmán Peralta, said on Wednesday that several walls of the facility had been strategically removed to allow better access to the disaster zone, facilitate debris removal and speed up the search.</p><p>Mr. Méndez confirmed the death of Rubby Pérez, the entertainer who was performing when the roof caved in at about 12:45 a.m. His body was recovered early Wednesday, the official said.</p><p>Grupo Popular, one of the most important banking companies in the Dominican Republic, announced that its president, Eduardo Grullón; his wife, Jhonna Rodríguez de Grullón; his sister, Alexandra Grullón, also a banker; and her husband, Eduardo Guarionex Estrella Cruz, the son of the country’s minister of public works, had all died in the disaster. An employee, Stephanie Avendaño Patricio, also died.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The governor of the province of Monte Cristi, Nelsy Cruz, also died. Ms. Cruz was initially trapped in the rubble and was able to call the nation’s president, Luis Abinader, from the wreckage.</p><p>Two former professional baseball players — Octavio Dotel, a former Yankees and Mets player, and Tony Blanco, who played for the Washington Nationals — were also killed.</p><p>The Dominican president declared three days of national mourning.</p><p>The disaster at Jet Set was a devastating blow in the Dominican Republic, where for decades people had gathered at the popular club, particularly on Monday nights. Entertainers, athletes and politicians frequented the club, and that roster of boldface-name guests was reflected in the death toll.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/eldeber.com.bo/reel/DILy4PxI063/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Videos</a> <a href="https://x.com/notibomba/status/1909555462036467756" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">circulating</a> on social media and verified by The New York Times chronicled the disaster.
