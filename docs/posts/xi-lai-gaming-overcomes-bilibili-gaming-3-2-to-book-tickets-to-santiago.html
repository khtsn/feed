</span> 3-2 in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598941/xi-lai-gaming-vs-bilibili-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-mbf" target="_blank">middle final</a> of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2685/vct-2026-china-kickoff/main-event" target="_blank">China Kickoff</a>, sending BLG down to the lower bracket and claiming the second spot at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2760/valorant-masters-santiago-2026" target="_blank">Masters Santiago</a>. </p>

<p>The Ascension squad secures their third international qualification in a row on their second try as they continue to cement themselves as one of the top teams in China. BLG didn&#39;t make it easy for them; despite having to field an <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/618881/biank-to-sub-in-for-bilibilis-knight-due-to-medical-emergency" target="_blank">emergency substitute</a> for <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4774/knight">
		Knight	</a>
</span> in <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3021/biank">
		Biank	</a>
</span>, the team made the series go the distance with overtime comebacks. </p>

<p>The five-map nailbiter played out on Abyss, Bind, Breeze, Pearl, and Split. BLG eked out Abyss 16-14, XLG won Bind 13-4, BLG took Breeze 14-12, and XLG won out Pearl 13-11 and Split 13-4. </p>

<p>The series began on BLG&#39;s first pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598941/xi-lai-gaming-vs-bilibili-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-mbf/?game=245260&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Abyss</a>. Both teams kept the same compositions that they had previously shown in the event across the match, with XLG opting into Waylay-Yoru on nearly every map and BLG leaning more into double-Initiator looks.</p>

<p>XLG had a slight edge on their attacking half as they started 7-5. <span data-ref-id="4">

</span> and Biank pulled out two low buy wins to keep the economy and the scoreline close. </p>

<p><em>rushia makes good use of BLG&#39;s only rifle with a 3K.</em></p>

<p>Going into the second half, XLG pulled further ahead after winning the pistol and shutting down BLG&#39;s Stinger force buy. Down 12-7, BLG dug their heels in for a comeback, forcing extra innings with confident postplant pushes. Both teams had opportunities to win in overtime; it was a <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4885/whzy">
		whzy	</a>
</span> Mid lurk that allowed BLG to close out 16-14, completing the comeback. </p>

<p>On <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598941/xi-lai-gaming-vs-bilibili-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-mbf/?game=245261&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Bind</a>, XLG demonstrated a mental recovery from the grueling first map with a dominant 13-4 win. Their 9-3 attack was a classic snowball as XLG first won the bonus and then leveraged their ultimate advantage to extend their lead. All five XLG members ended with positive K/Ds while Rarga led them forward, prying open sites with four first kills and overproducing with 19 kills total and 190 ADR. </p>

</span> hits a 1v2 to keep the snowball rolling.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598941/xi-lai-gaming-vs-bilibili-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-mbf/?game=245262&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Breeze</a> was the most back-and-forth map of the series. After trading blows from 4-4 to 6-6 to 8-8, XLG started holding down the sites on their defense, earning themselves three map points at 12-9. Once again, the individuals of BLG ground it back to overtime by creating chaos and thriving it as whzy forced his way through as Neon. This time, BLG ended it in one clean shot as they ran it back all the way to 14-12. </p>

<p>happywei topfragged in the map, but it was Biank taking on the role of super sub for BLG as he ended with the highest rating of 1.32 and 22 kills.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598941/xi-lai-gaming-vs-bilibili-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-mbf/?game=245263&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Pearl</a> was a tale of two defense halves. XLG, defending first, showed mastery in the retake as they quickly spun up a 9-3 lead, with one of BLG&#39;s only rounds being a whzy 1v3. </p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Eqg7_0F8cs?si=fbW5WOsXwWWH31lT&amp;clip=UgkxwiEY_18haagcBt8aJKsrjSjLXiXBXcT8&amp;clipt=EN3Y2QcY7f_bBw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><em>happywei makes the B site his own.</em></p>

<p>On their own defense, BLG continued the comeback theme, locking down chokepoints to draw the score back to 10-10 and then 11-11. XLG finally staved off the comeback in regulation for the first time, forcing a decider with a 13-11 victory.</p>

<p>That decider was <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598941/xi-lai-gaming-vs-bilibili-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-mbf/?game=245264&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Split</a>. Similar to Bind, XLG asserted their superiority with a shutout. The individuals were firing as the members of XLG combined for six total 3K round wins for a 9-3 defense half before winning the pistol to secure an easy 13-4 and a well-earned spot at Masters Santiago. <span data-ref-id="8">
