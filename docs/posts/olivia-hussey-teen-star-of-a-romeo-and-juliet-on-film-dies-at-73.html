She was 73.</p><p>The cause was breast cancer, her publicist, Natalie Beita, said.</p><p>Ms. Hussey’s lifelong association with Juliet came from how rapturously that movie was received. Much of the reaction concentrated on the decision of its director, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/arts/music/franco-zeffirelli-dead.html" title="">Franco Zeffirelli</a>, to cast two unknown teenagers as his leads. Ms. Hussey was 15 when filming began; her co-star, Leonard Whiting, was 17.</p><p>It was standard at the time to give the roles of the desperate lovers to established stars. Leslie Howard, for one, was 43 when he made his debut as Romeo in a 1936 adaptation.</p><p>What Ms. Hussey and Mr. Whiting lacked in practiced elocution they more than made up for in emotional intensity, suggesting an identification with their characters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Whiting sprinted from Juliet’s bedroom with a wild but innocent exuberance. When Juliet’s nursemaid (Pat Heywood) counseled that Juliet go through with a pragmatic marriage to a man other than Romeo, Ms. Hussey responded with an extraordinary facial expression — wide-eyed, horrified, stupefied — suggesting that it was her first encounter with the possibility of betraying love.</p><p>In a review for The Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/romeo-and-juliet-1968" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>, “I believe Franco Zeffirelli’s ‘Romeo and Juliet’ is the most exciting film of Shakespeare ever made.” He credited the film with “the passion, the sweat, the violence, the poetry, the love and the tragedy in the most immediate terms I can imagine.”</p><p>The movie grossed nearly $39 million at the domestic box office (about $350 million today) and it won Academy Awards for cinematography and costumes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The director Franco Zeffirelli, left, with Ms. Hussey and her co-star, Leonard Whiting, at the Parisian premiere of “Romeo and Juliet.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eustache Cardenas/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt0jW_1yayo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">featurette</a> on the making of the film captures the tenor of Ms. Hussey and Mr. Whiting’s stardom. “These are the most talked-about teenagers in the world today,” the narrator says.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Hussey traveled widely promoting the film. At one point, in Britain, she did so much dancing at a dinner with Prince Charles that she took her shoes off, stretched her legs across his lap and received a royal foot massage.</p><p>Yet in the years to come Ms. Hussey did not have another big role that earned both box-office success and critical acclaim. She spent much time commemorating her role as Juliet.</p><p>One part of the movie was remembered for something other than artistry: a brief scene in which Romeo and Juliet wake up nude in bed together. The camera lingers on Mr. Whiting’s buttocks and registers a flash of Ms. Hussey’s breasts.</p><p>Mr. Ebert castigated those who were scandalized by the scene — “A lot of fuss has been made about the brief, beautiful nude love scene,” he wrote — and Ms. Hussey seemed initially to feel the same way, describing Mr. Zeffirelli as a father figure whom she would have liked to work with on all of her movies.</p><p>But in her 2018 memoir, “The Girl on the Balcony,” she was more ambivalent.</p><p>With Mr. Zeffirelli’s assurance, she wrote, she had thought that she would be clothed in the scene, until she found herself having makeup applied “head to toe,” prompting what she called a “small panic attack.” One “dirty old man” on the crew, she wrote, had to be removed from the set.</p><p>“Nobody my age had done that before,” she <a href="https://variety.com/2018/film/news/romeo-and-juliet-at-50-olivia-hussey-leonard-whiting-1202970939/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> Variety in 2018, referring to the nude scene. Yet she added, “It was needed for the film.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>During her press tour for the book, she <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/olivia-hussey-recalls-controversial-romeo-and-juliet-role-at-16-reveals-personal-tragedies" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> Fox News that the scene “was done very tastefully” and “wasn’t that big of a deal.” Mr. Zeffirelli wrote an adoring foreword to the book.</p><p>Ms. Hussey’s attitude took another turn in December 2022, when she and Mr. Whiting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/04/movies/romeo-and-juliet-nudity-lawsuit.html" title="">sued</a> Paramount Pictures, the film’s distributor, seeking damages of up to $500 million, claiming that they had been forced to appear nude and that the movie constituted “child pornography.” The suit was prompted by a California law that temporarily suspended the statute of limitations on claims of child sexual abuse.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Hussey in 2018 promoting her memoir, “The Girl on the Balcony,” in Los Angeles.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brandon Williams/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A judge <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/romeo-juliet-lawsuit-thrown-out-nude-scene-1235625534/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">threw out</a> the suit in May 2023, ruling that the scene was not pornographic.</p><p>New York magazine reported that at the time of the suit Ms. Hussey was $22,000 in debt. In an <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/romeo-juliet-lawsuit-dismissed-again-olivia-hussey-leonard-whiting-1236184850/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with Variety, she said that she and Mr. Whiting had each received only 1,500 British pounds (roughly $35,000 today) for their performances.</p><p>“Looking back on all of that, Leonard and I, we felt exploited throughout,” she said.</p><p>Olivia Osuna was born on April 17, 1951, in Buenos Aires to Andreas and Joy Hussey. Her father was a tango singer. Her parents divorced when Olivia was 2, and her mother took her and Olivia’s brother, Andrew, to her native England, where she worked as a legal secretary in London. The children used their mother’s surname.</p><p>Joy Hussey was an observant Roman Catholic, and Olivia would walk around her home with a towel on her head, pretending to be a nun, she recalled. She realized that what she liked was not the idea of being a nun but the pretending to be one. She started attending drama school as a little girl.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In 1966, Olivia starred in a stage adaptation of Muriel Spark’s novel “The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie” alongside Vanessa Redgrave. She got the role of Juliet after two auditions.</p><p>Ms. Hussey played the Virgin Mary in another Zeffirelli film, “Jesus of Nazareth” (1977), and the titular role in “Mother Teresa,” a 2003 television biopic. She also starred in “Black Christmas” (1974), a horror movie that was panned at the time but that later earned Ms. Hussey the reputation as the “prototype” of the last female survivor of a slasher film, as The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/movies/in-horror-films-the-final-girl-is-a-survivor-to-the-core.html" title="">reported</a> in 2015.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Hussey in 2018 at the TCM Classic Film Festival Opening Night Gala in Hollywood.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tara Ziemba/WireImage, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In later interviews, she said that the success and hoopla surrounding “Romeo and Juliet” had exhausted her, causing her to turn down movie roles opposite John Wayne and Richard Burton and to focus instead on her personal life. </p><p>Ms. Hussey’s first three marriages ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, David Eisley; a son, Alexander Martin, from her first marriage, to Dean Paul Martin, the son of the singer Dean Martin; another son, Maximillian Fuse, from her third marriage, to Akira Fuse, a Japanese pop star; a daughter, India Eisley; her brother; and a grandson. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008.</p><p>Mr. Whiting, a lifelong friend of Ms. Hussey’s, once sent her a darkly comic screenplay he wrote in which Romeo and Juliet live on after their youth. Ms. Hussey responded that she could not play the part, she <a href="https://variety.com/2018/film/news/romeo-and-juliet-at-50-olivia-hussey-leonard-whiting-1202970939/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> Variety in 2018, for the same reason that she never went out in sweatpants: She wished to keep alive the public image of herself as Shakespeare’s Juliet.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>That was how she met Mr. Eisley. He saw her at a delicatessen and introduced himself as someone who had seen her performance in “Romeo and Juliet” 50 times. He turned out to know every line of the play.</p><p>“I couldn’t resist him,” Ms. Hussey <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22I+am+such+a+diehard+romantic.+I+guess+a+part+of+me+thinks+I+am+Juliet.%E2%80%9D&amp;sca_esv=7e628e7dbaa3e60f&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIJvQTfd455wqmY0sXIHMHXgc9OOIw%3A1735514093635&amp;ei=7ddxZ9-yJuip5NoPncLsoAE&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif3bbojc6KAxXoFFkFHR0hGxQQ4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=%22I+am+such+a+diehard+romantic.+I+guess+a+part+of+me+thinks+I+am+Juliet.%E2%80%9D&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiSiJJIGFtIHN1Y2ggYSBkaWVoYXJkIHJvbWFudGljLiBJIGd1ZXNzIGEgcGFydCBvZiBtZSB0aGlua3MgSSBhbSBKdWxpZXQu4oCdSK4OUNkHWNwMcAJ4AJABAJgBUaABjgGqAQEyuAEDyAEA-AEBmAIAoAIAmAMAiAYBkgcAoAf6BQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the British newspaper The Telegraph in 2002. “I am such a die-hard romantic.
