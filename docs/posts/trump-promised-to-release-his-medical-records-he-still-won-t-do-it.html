Trump declined to release his medical records, instead offering a four-paragraph letter from his personal doctor proclaiming that he would be “the healthiest person ever elected to the presidency.”</p><p>In 2020, when he was hospitalized with Covid and running for re-election, Mr. Trump’s doctors gave minimal information about his condition, which, it emerged later, was far more dire than their public descriptions let on.</p><p>In 2024, days before becoming the official Republican presidential nominee for the third time, he was grazed by a would-be assassin’s bullet, yet his campaign did not hold a briefing on his condition, release hospital records or make the emergency physicians who treated him available for interview.</p><p>Now, just over a month from an election that could make Mr. Trump, 78, the oldest person ever to serve as president (82 years, 7 months and 6 days when his term would end in January 2029), he is refusing to release even the most basic information about his health.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>If he wins, Mr. Trump could enter the Oval Office with an array of potentially worrisome issues, medical experts say: cardiac risk factors, possible aftereffects from the July assassination attempt and the cognitive decline that naturally comes with age, among others.</p><p>Age became a major point of concern for voters weighing the capabilities of President Biden, and a poor debate performance that showcased him struggling to articulate sentences ultimately forced him to withdraw from the race. Suddenly facing an opponent nearly 20 years his junior, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPyzhupx1BQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> CBS News in August that he would <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-insults-harris-intelligence-medical-records-tv-exclusive/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“very gladly”</a> release his medical records to the public, saying he had recently had a medical exam.</p><p>The New York Times requested a copy of those records. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump eventually referred The Times to a <a href="https://jackson.house.gov/uploadedfiles/cannon_118_20240720_140716.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one-page letter</a> that his former physician, now a Republican member of Congress, wrote a week after the assassination attempt, describing the bullet wound to his ear and its progress in healing. The Times sent numerous follow-up questions. She did not reply.</p><p>Here is what is known about Mr. Trump’s health — and what is not.</p><h2 id="link-287188c">Cardiac Health</h2><p>The most detailed overview of Mr. Trump’s health to date came in January 2018, when the White House physician, Dr. Ronny Jackson, <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-and-dr-ronny-jackson-01162018/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">briefed reporters</a> after Mr. Trump’s first physical as president.</p><p>His blood pressure (122/74) and an ultrasound of his heart were normal, but his cholesterol was worryingly high and his body mass index put him just 0.1 points below the threshold for medical obesity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Even though Mr. Trump was taking a statin, a drug used to lower cholesterol levels to well below 100, his LDL cholesterol was still 143 — so high that some outside cardiologists worried about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/us/politics/trump-physical-heart-health-cholesterol.html" title="">his potential for a heart attack or stroke</a>.</p><p>Dr. Jackson said that Mr. Trump was 6-foot-3 (an inch taller than what was written on his <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-drivers-license-height-232948" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">driver’s license</a>) and 239 pounds. A year later, his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/us/politics/trump-obese.html" title="">weight</a> had risen to 243 pounds, the White House physician reported, making him officially obese.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump with Dr. Ronny Jackson after his annual physical exam at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., in 2018.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yuri Gripas/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At that point in 2019, he was taking a quadrupled dose of a statin — 40 milligrams daily, instead of 10 — and his LDL cholesterol had fallen to 122, still above the desired threshold even on that high a dose.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.axios.com/2020/06/03/trump-physical-white-house-doctor" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">next spring</a>, the White House reported that Mr. Trump’s LDL had dropped below 100, though his weight was 244 pounds.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>A 2023 booking record at the Fulton County jail in Atlanta, created when Mr. Trump was indicted on charges of election fraud in Georgia, listed his weight as 215, but he was not weighed at the jail, and his aides gave the figure on the form.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s most recent <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/111444920245122377" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">health update</a> came in a three-paragraph letter from a new personal doctor, Bruce A. Aronwald, in November 2023, as the Republican primary campaign was heating up. It commended Mr. Trump twice for “weight reduction,” but did not say how much he weighed or give any details about medications or numerical results of any tests, only saying they were “well within the normal range,” “excellent” and “exceptional.”</p><p>When it comes to heart health, Mr. Trump has some factors working to his benefit: He has no history of smoking or drinking, and he does not have diabetes. But cardiologists agree that the health of a 78-year-old patient with a history of very high cholesterol cannot be adequately assessed using measurements taken more than four years ago.</p><h2 id="link-3f324513">Cognitive Health</h2><p>Mr. Trump’s father had Alzheimer’s. Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-cognitive-test.html" title="">repeatedly</a> said that he “aced” cognitive tests — most recently in August — but has not released any documentation.</p><p>Dr. Jackson <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/politics/trump-cognitive-test-results.html" title="">said in 2018 that Mr. Trump took</a> the <a href="https://mocacognition.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Montreal Cognitive Assessment</a>, or MoCA, a common 10-minute screening test to look for outright dementia. It asks participants to recite five words <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/politics/trump-cognitive-test-results.html" title="">in order</a> and repeat them later on; to identify a camel; and to draw a clock depicting 11:10, among other things.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>It gives an overview of various domains of cognition — short term memory, executive function, spatial function, orientation and language — but it does not provide a detailed measure of any of them, experts said.</p><p>“It is not uncommon to see people who have mild cognitive impairment score normally on the MoCA, but by history and observation from others, they have cognitive problems,” said Dr. <a href="https://pennmemorycenter.org/who-we-are/staff/jason-karlawish-md/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jason Karlawish</a>, an expert on neurology and aging at the University of Pennsylvania. “And it’s only when a clinician performs more detailed testing that reveals problems such as with executive function.”</p><p>In Mr. Trump’s debate against President Biden this year, it was Mr. Biden whose performance was widely commented on, including by his allies, for exhibiting signs of aging. Dr. Jeffrey Kuhlman, who was the White House physician for Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said Mr. Trump’s more recent debate against Vice President Kamala Harris showed that “there’s no reasoning — he’s not taking in new concepts, he’s not forming arguments based on what she’s saying. He’s just spitting out rote memory.”</p><p>Mr. Trump has several times referred to Hillary Clinton or Mr. Biden as the “Obama administration,” and made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/us/politics/trump-biden-age.html" title="">so many verbal slips</a> regarding cities, states and foreign leaders that his onetime presidential opponent, Ron DeSantis, <a href="https://x.com/DeSantisWarRoom/status/1716844493339500890?s=20" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">started</a> a “Trump accident tracker.” At rallies, he speaks in an increasingly disjointed manner.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Since he made clear in 2011 he was considering running for president, Mr. Trump has been prone to going off-script and getting bored with his prepared remarks. But his digressions have become more frequent, and it has become harder to decipher the meaning of them or to determine a through line of his thinking.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office on his last day as president in 1989.

Lopez/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Dr. Kuhlman, who has a forthcoming book on presidential health care — including a chapter on the physical and mental requirements of a president — said he believed that presidents and presidential candidates should undergo an in-depth <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/opinion/president-physician-cognitive-testing.html" title="">neurocognitive assessment</a>, administered by independent specialists, repeated periodically throughout the term and released to the public.</p><p>He said a baseline test would be useful if Kamala Harris won, too, given that she would be 68 by the end of a second term.</p><p>“If there’s one area that needs to be 100 percent in a chief executive — especially chief executive of the United States — it’s cognitive function,” said Anand Kumar, an expert in geriatric psychiatry at the University of Illinois Chicago.</p><p>Until recently, President Ronald Reagan dominated discussions about the risk of cognitive decline among aging presidents. Mr. Reagan was <a href="https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/reagans/ronald-reagan/reagans-letter-announcing-his-alzheimers-diagnosis" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">diagnosed</a> with Alzheimer’s six years after leaving office, but his staff has said they noticed early signs of the issues during his term.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Dr. Lawrence C. Mohr, Jr., who was White House physician under Mr. Reagan, said that arranging for neurologists to examine Mr. Reagan as part of his annual exam showed “that President Reagan did not have Alzheimer’s disease when he was in office.”</p><p>“He did occasionally forget some names, and that’s — you know, that was well documented,” he said. </p><h2 id="link-3364ae07">After the Shooting</h2><p>Millions of people have watched video of the moment when Mr. Trump grabbed his ear, dropped to the ground and emerged with blood streaming down his face.</p><p>But the campaign has provided little information about what happened next — which makes it difficult to understand any implications for the long term.</p><p>Bystander videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52-OEZFf_7s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">show</a> that Mr. Trump walked unaided into the emergency room of Butler Memorial Hospital, as security teams lined the building in camo gear, pointing their AR-15-style rifles out toward the parking lot.</p><p>In a recent interview with The Times, hospital officials said that Mr. Trump was brought to a patient room. His campaign released a statement saying that <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/02c92dea-4a31-4822-9266-a5bd28d132ed" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he was “fine” and “being checked out at a local medical facility,”</a> and that “more details will follow.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>By 9 p.m., Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8csBwii98" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and his motorcade</a> had left the hospital.</p><p>The most substantial update came a week later, not from the campaign or Mr. Trump’s current doctor but from Dr. Jackson — the former White House physician turned congressman from Texas. In a <a href="https://jackson.house.gov/uploadedfiles/cannon_118_20240720_140716.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">letter</a> titled “Memorandum for Concerned Citizens of the United States,” Dr. Jackson wrote that he had visited Mr. Trump in New Jersey late in the evening after the shooting and that “the bullet track produced a 2 cm wide wound that extended down to the cartilaginous surface of the ear.”</p><p>The letter mentioned a CT scan of the head, but did not offer any details about the results.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Dr. Jackson told The Times, “Representative Jackson checks in regularly on President Trump and can assure you that President Trump continues to be in outstanding health.”</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRfKh1ARss4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">television interview</a>, Dr. David Rottinghaus, an emergency room physician at Butler Memorial Hospital, said that while he could not share details about Mr. Trump, “anytime there is a high-velocity injury, particularly from a weapon — and a gunshot — there is potential for significant damage. So you have to be very meticulous and very diligent in the evaluation of even something that may appear to be minor.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The stage in Butler, Pa., that Mr. Trump was speaking from when he was shot on July 13.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Mr. Trump’s campaign did not share his patient discharge paperwork or any details about specific injuries, treatment or follow-up plans.

They did say that they had not spoken to Mr. Trump’s personal physician.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Dr. Kenji Inaba, a trauma surgeon with the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, said that some physical effects of a shooting to the ear — such as bleeding between the skull and the brain, or damage to the bones in the inner ear — could at first be invisible. But most of those complications would have been obvious by now, he said.</p><p>“We can infer from the fact that he is walking, talking, campaigning and doing things normally that those things didn’t occur,” Dr. Inaba said.</p><p>Mr. Trump has said publicly that he is not suffering from any post-traumatic stress or other lasting effects from the assassination attempt, the first of two he has faced in the last three months. </p><p>When he thought he saw someone moving toward the stage <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/us/politics/trump-long-island-rally.html" title="">at a rally in Long Island</a> earlier this month, he seemed to acknowledge a fight-or-flight response, interrupting his own comments on taxes to describe the anxiety.</p><p>“I thought this was a wiseguy coming up,” he said. “You know, I’ve got a little bit of a yip problem here, right?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Erika Felix, a psychologist and a professor of clinical psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said that such hypervigilance was extremely common in people who have recently experienced violence, alongside other symptoms such as difficulty sleeping, feelings of jumpiness or nervousness, or intrusive memories of the event.</p><p>“For a lot of people, that just dissipates naturally over time,” she said. “Now, he had a second one, so that potentially increases the risk of more long-term reactions. But we also have really good treatments. It doesn’t have to become a disabling or disqualifying condition by any means.”</p><h2 id="link-10544065">A Record of Obfuscation</h2><p>Historically, most presidential candidates have released medical records to assure voters they are fit for office, though there is no rule requiring them to do so. Kamala Harris, 59, the Democratic nominee, has yet to release any of her personal medical information.</p><p>Mr. Trump has a long history of fiercely guarding his personal medical information. After his longtime personal physician, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/14/nyregion/harold-bornstein-dead.html" title="">Dr. Harold N.

People with knowledge of his health later said he had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/11/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html" title="">suffered from lung infiltrates</a>, which contain substances such as fluid or bacteria, as well as low blood oxygen levels and other signs of acute illness.</p><p>Mark Meadows, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/06/us/politics/trump-covid-blood-oxygen.html" title="">later wrote in his book</a> that Mr. Trump had tested positive for Covid three days before his first presidential debate with Mr. Biden, not after it, and that his blood oxygen level had gone so dangerously low that staff members were preparing for a presidential hospital stay that could last “weeks, maybe longer.”</p><p>While presidents have the same legal right to confidentiality as any patient, secrecy around an acute medical incident is unusual.

But the public has not seen her basic results — height, weight, blood pressure, labs, history of mammograms and other cancer screenings.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emily Baumgaertner is a national health reporter for The Times, focusing on public health issues that primarily affect vulnerable communities.<span> </span></p></div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a senior political correspondent reporting on the 2024 presidential campaign, down ballot races across the country and the investigations into former President Donald J.
