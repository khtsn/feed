And after stripping out food and fuel costs, which can be volatile from month to month, a “core” inflation measure is expected to hold steady at 3.2 percent.</p><div><p>Here’s what else to know about the report:</p><ul><li><p><strong>The big picture:</strong> The overall C.P.I. index has been cooling substantially from a peak of 9.1 percent in the summer of 2022. And both this index and a related measure — the Federal Reserve’s preferred Personal Consumption Expenditures index — have been creeping closer to the 2 percent annual rate that the central bank aims for over time.</p></li><li><p><strong>What it means for the Fed and interest rates:</strong> Recent progress on inflation has been welcome news for the Fed. Policymakers cut interest rates in September for the first time in more than four years, lowering them by an unusually large half percentage point. Fed policymakers have signaled that they expect to lower interest rates further as inflation cools: They projected in September that they would make two more quarter-point rate cuts this year.</p></li><li><p><strong>How the economy is doing:</strong> Recent data have suggested that both economic growth and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/business/economy/jobs-report-september.html" title="">the job market</a> are holding up. “I don’t want to see the economy weaken,” John C. Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f6185278-5b40-4120-83ea-b0875bfb9985" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in an interview</a> with The Financial Times this week. “I want to maintain the strength that we see in the economy and in the labor market.”</p></li><li><p><strong>The political impact:</strong> That inflation is falling and interest rates are coming down could be good news for Democrats ahead of the election, bringing relief to consumers who have smarted from years of rising prices. But inflation could still be in for some bumps in coming months. Used car prices are climbing after months of moderation, and while officials are still expecting a cool-down in housing inflation, it has been slow to fully materialize.</p></li><li><p><strong>A note of caution:</strong> Given the stubborn price increases in some categories, and the fact that core inflation remains above the Fed’s target, some officials at the central bank have taken a warier stance toward rate cuts. They don’t want to lower borrowing costs too much too quickly, making it harder to fully snuff out price increases in the longer run. “We have not yet achieved our inflation goal,” Michelle Bowman, a Fed governor, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240920a.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote explaining</a> why she voted against September’s big rate cut in favor of a smaller move.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzFhMGJkYzQ1LTE4NTUtNTBmYy1iZWM2LTE4YTM5YzE0OTMwZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/10/business/cpi-inflation-fed#with-inflation-still-somewhat-elevated-fed-officials-were-divided-on-how-much-to-cut-rates" data-source-id="100000009751980"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jeanna-smialek"><img alt="Jeanna Smialek" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/03/reader-center/author-jeanna-smialek/author-jeanna-smialek-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/03/reader-center/author-jeanna-smialek/author-jeanna-smialek-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/03/reader-center/author-jeanna-smialek/author-jeanna-smialek-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-10T11:03:01.330Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 10, 2024, 7:03 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Federal Reserve officials were divided over how much to lower interest rates in September, although most officials favored the large half-point rate cut that central bankers ultimately made.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tom Brenner/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Federal Reserve officials were divided over how much to lower interest rates in September, minutes from their last meeting showed, although most officials favored the large half-point rate cut that central bankers ultimately made.</p><p>“Noting that inflation was still somewhat elevated while economic growth remained solid and unemployment remained low, some participants observed that they would have preferred” a quarter point reduction, according to the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20241009a.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">minutes from the Sept. 17 and 18</a> gathering released on Wednesday. And “a few others indicated that they could have supported such a decision.”</p><div><p>While one Fed governor, Michelle Bowman, did vote against the Fed’s big rate cut in favor of a smaller move, the fresh minutes showed that she was not alone in her misgivings. They suggested that the merits of a smaller move were debated.</p><p>“A few participants” thought that a smaller move “could signal a more predictable path of economic normalization,” the minutes showed.</p><p>The revelation that there was a spirited discussion about how much to cut rates at the Fed’s last meeting underscores what an uncertain juncture the central bank is facing. Officials are trying to calibrate policy so that it is cooling the economy enough to wrangle inflation fully, without slowing it so much that it plunges America into a recession. But that is an inexact science.</p></div></div></div></section></div></article></div>
