That was somewhat higher than economists had forecast.</p><p>After stripping out food and fuel costs, which can be volatile from month to month, a “core” inflation measure picked up slightly to 3.3 percent, up from 3.2 percent in August.</p><p>While the report underscored that price increases were not yet fully tamed, September’s data did not change the basic picture for officials at the Federal Reserve. Inflation still shows clear signs of gradually coming under control.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Consumer price increases have cooled sharply from their peak of 9.1 percent in the summer of 2022, even though September’s slowdown was less dramatic than expected. And the fresh report offered some encouraging details under the hood: A closely watched measure of housing costs is finally beginning to moderate on a monthly basis. Because shelter makes up such a big part of overall inflation, that could help to make the ongoing slowdown more durable.</p><p>“Inflation doesn’t slow in a straight line, but the overall trend in inflation is one of slowing,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at T.D. Securities. “There is some good news and some bad news: The good news is that shelter inflation slowed notably.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Both the Consumer Price Index and a related measure — the Federal Reserve’s preferred Personal Consumption Expenditures <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/business/economy/fed-inflation-pce.html" title="">index</a> — have been creeping closer to the Fed’s 2 percent annual target for months now.</p><p>And while the central bank is not yet ready to declare victory over rapid inflation, the recent progress has been welcome news for officials there. After lifting interest rates sharply in 2022 and 2023 and then keeping them high in an effort to hit the brakes on the economy, Fed officials now have the breathing room to ease up on their policy response.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Policymakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/business/economy/fed-reserve-interest-rate-cut.html" title="">cut interest rates</a> in September for the first time in more than four years, lowering them by an unusually large half percentage point. Officials also signaled that they expected to lower interest rates further as inflation continued to cool. Their September projections indicated two more quarter-point rate cuts this year.</p><p>While the latest inflation report was bumpier than expected, it was unlikely to upend the outlook for the Fed: Investors <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">still widely expect</a> a cut in November.</p><p>But the inflation data probably dispels any lingering suspicion that the central bank might opt for another big rate reduction at its upcoming meeting, which had already become a very slim prospect.</p><p>“The Fed doesn’t need to do half-point rate cuts, because inflation is still somewhat of a risk,” Mr. Goldberg said.</p><p>Central bankers are likely to pay close attention to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t02.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cooling in housing costs</a>. The cost to rent a primary residence slowed to 0.3 percent on a monthly basis, and a measure that tracks how much it would cost for someone to rent a house that they own also ticked down to 0.3 percent, down from 0.5 percent previously.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Economists have been waiting for months for a moderation in shelter inflation — only to find themselves repeatedly disappointed. Its arrival could help to make the recent cooling in price increases more sustainable, because housing costs make up about a third of the overall measure.</p><p>That inflation is falling and interest rates are coming down could be good news for Democrats ahead of the election, bringing relief to consumers who have smarted from years of rising prices.</p><p>Lael Brainard, the director of the White House National Economic Council, underscored that overall Consumer Price Index inflation was back to its early <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=1vsV6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2020 level</a> as of Thursday’s report.</p><p>“We keep making progress,” she said in a statement following <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/10/statement-from-national-economic-advisor-lael-brainard-on-the-september-2024-consumer-price-index/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the data release</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/10/multimedia/10dc-inflation-btjf/10dc-inflation-btjf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/10/multimedia/10dc-inflation-btjf/10dc-inflation-btjf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/10/multimedia/10dc-inflation-btjf/10dc-inflation-btjf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Bags filled with groceries." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/10/multimedia/10dc-inflation-btjf/10dc-inflation-btjf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/10/multimedia/10dc-inflation-btjf/10dc-inflation-btjf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/10/multimedia/10dc-inflation-btjf/10dc-inflation-btjf-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/10/multimedia/10dc-inflation-btjf/10dc-inflation-btjf-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bags of food at a mobile food bank in Malden, Mass.

And inflation overall could still be in for further bumps in coming months. Thursday’s report showed that used car prices and airfares picked up in price, and medical care services also ticked up notably.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“The bad news is that services inflation is still a problem,” Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings, wrote in reaction to the report.</p><p>Given the continued price increases in some categories, and the fact that core inflation remains notably above the Fed’s target, some officials at the central bank have remained wary. They don’t want to lower borrowing costs too much too quickly, making it harder to fully snuff out price increases in the longer run.</p><p>“We have not yet achieved our inflation goal,” Michelle Bowman, a Fed governor, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240920a.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote explaining</a> why she had voted against September’s big rate cut in favor of a smaller move.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
