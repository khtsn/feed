    <h1>Tim Walz Will Not Run for Minnesota’s Senate Seat</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Focusing on re-election also allows Mr. Walz to avoid what would have been an awkward Senate primary contest against his lieutenant governor, Peggy Flanagan, <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/peggy-flanagan-running-us-senate-minnesota" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who announced her campaign for the seat last week</a>. Mr. Walz and Ms. Flanagan, who had been political allies for two decades, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/us/after-loss-tim-walz-faces-partys-sinking-fortunes-in-minnesota.html" title="">had a falling out over shared campaign finances</a> when Mr. Walz returned to Minnesota from the presidential campaign trail.</p><p>Several other Minnesota Democrats have said they are considering running for Ms. Smith’s Senate seat. They include Keith Ellison, the state’s attorney general, Representatives Angie Craig and Ilhan Omar, and Melissa Hortman, the Democratic leader in the Minnesota state house. Mr. Walz is not expected to endorse a candidate in the primary.</p><p>On the Republican side, Royce White, a former professional basketball player who lost a 2024 Senate race to Senator Amy Klobuchar, has said he will run, along with <a href="https://www.kaaltv.com/news/adam-schwarze-announces-candidacy-for-u-s-senate-in-minnesota-to-replace-tina-smith/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Adam Schwarze</a>, a former Navy SEAL. Michelle Tafoya, a former television sports broadcaster who has become a regular on the right-wing commentary circuit, <a href="https://www.wdayradionow.com/news/local-news/michele-tafoya-close-to-making-a-decision-on-mn-senate-run/?rand=2052779639" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has also said she is considering running for the seat</a>.</p><p>No one has yet entered the race for governor of Minnesota. Mr. Walz coasted to general election victories in 2018 and 2022, though the state has been much closer in two of the last three presidential elections.</p></div></div>
