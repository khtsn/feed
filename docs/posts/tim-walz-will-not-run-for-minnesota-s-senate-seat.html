Tim Walz of Minnesota, who rose from relative obscurity to become the Democratic nominee for vice president last year, will not run for his state’s open Senate seat in 2026 and will instead begin the process to seek a third term as governor, his spokesman said Wednesday.</p><p>“Governor Walz is not running for the United States Senate,” said Teddy Tschann, Mr. Walz’s spokesman. “He loves his job as governor and he’s exploring the possibility of another term to continue his work to make Minnesota the best state in the country for kids.”</p><p>By staying out of the contest to replace Senator Tina Smith, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/politics/tina-smith-minnesota-senate.html" title="">a Minnesota Democrat who is not seeking re-election in 2026</a>, Mr. Walz effectively kicks off a primary contest for the Senate seat that could be competitive should Republicans field a well-financed candidate.</p><p>It also positions Mr. Walz, who won national attention for his “Midwestern dad” persona and football-coach background when he and Vice President Kamala Harris ran against Donald J. Trump, to potentially enter the 2028 Democratic presidential primary. During <a href="https://x.com/Nieuwsuur/status/1891958725591564448" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview with a Dutch television station last week</a>, Mr. Walz said he was “not ruling out” running for president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Focusing on re-election also allows Mr. Walz to avoid what would have been an awkward Senate primary contest against his lieutenant governor, Peggy Flanagan, <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/peggy-flanagan-running-us-senate-minnesota" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who announced her campaign for the seat last week</a>. Mr. Walz and Ms. Flanagan, who had been political allies for two decades, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/us/after-loss-tim-walz-faces-partys-sinking-fortunes-in-minnesota.html" title="">had a falling out over shared campaign finances</a> when Mr. Walz returned to Minnesota from the presidential campaign trail.</p><p>Several other Minnesota Democrats have said they are considering running for Ms. Smith’s Senate seat. They include Keith Ellison, the state’s attorney general, Representatives Angie Craig and Ilhan Omar, and Melissa Hortman, the Democratic leader in the Minnesota state house. Mr. Walz is not expected to endorse a candidate in the primary.</p><p>On the Republican side, Royce White, a former professional basketball player who lost a 2024 Senate race to Senator Amy Klobuchar, has said he will run, along with <a href="https://www.kaaltv.com/news/adam-schwarze-announces-candidacy-for-u-s-senate-in-minnesota-to-replace-tina-smith/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Adam Schwarze</a>, a former Navy SEAL. Michelle Tafoya, a former television sports broadcaster who has become a regular on the right-wing commentary circuit, <a href="https://www.wdayradionow.com/news/local-news/michele-tafoya-close-to-making-a-decision-on-mn-senate-run/?rand=2052779639" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has also said she is considering running for the seat</a>.</p><p>No one has yet entered the race for governor of Minnesota. Mr. Walz coasted to general election victories in 2018 and 2022, though the state has been much closer in two of the last three presidential elections.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Reid J.
