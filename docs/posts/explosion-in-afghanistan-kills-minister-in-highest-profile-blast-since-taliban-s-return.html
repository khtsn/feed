It was a strike at the heart of the Taliban’s power structure after years of essentially unchallenged dominance.</p><p>Mr. Haqqani, the minister of refugees and repatriation, was a senior member of the Haqqani Network, an influential faction within the Taliban. The United States and the United Nations have designated the Haqqani Network as a terrorist organization.</p><p>The U.S. Treasury had named Mr. Haqqani a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/tg1055" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“specially designated global terrorist,”</a> and the U.S. government had <a href="https://rewardsforjustice.net/rewards/khalil-haqqani/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offered a reward of up to $5 million</a> for information about him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>His nephew <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/world/asia/afghanistan-sirajuddin-haqqani-taliban.html" title="">Sirajuddin Haqqani</a>, the acting interior minister, has led efforts to reshape the Taliban’s global image. Since the Taliban’s new rise to power, the Haqqanis have appeared eager to reach out to the West for recognition — to little effect so far. </p><p>And that effort has at times seemed at odds with the dictates of the Taliban’s supreme leader, Sheikh Haibatullah Akhundzada, who has returned Afghanistan to an uncompromising marginalization of women and education.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast. The government blamed an Islamic State affiliate known as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/27/world/asia/who-isis-k-afghanistan.html" title="">ISIS-K</a>, which has been one of the few remaining antagonists to the Taliban.</p><p>Mr. Haqqani was a crucial Taliban fund-raiser, according to the U.S. Treasury. He also led military operations and was an ally in Al Qaeda’s operations, according to <a href="https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/en/sanctions/1988/materials/summaries/individual/khalil-ahmed-haqqani" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a report by the United Nations Security Council</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>As a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/taliban-leaders-afghanistan.html" title="">special representative</a> of the Taliban’s supreme leader, Mr. Haqqani played a public role in establishing the Taliban’s authority as they established their new government.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lynsey Chutel is a Times reporter based in London who covers breaking news in Africa, the Middle East and Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lynsey-chutel">More about Lynsey Chutel</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
