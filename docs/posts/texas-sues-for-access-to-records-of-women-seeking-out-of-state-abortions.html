Women are not subject to criminal prosecution for obtaining abortions, but state law imposes penalties of as much as life in prison for those who aid in obtaining abortions.</p><p>The lawsuit claims that the privacy rules ignore federal law that lets states view medical records “for law enforcement purposes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a statement on Wednesday, Texas’ attorney general, Ken Paxton, <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-sues-biden-administration-over-illegal-rule-would-weaken-state-law" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called the April rule</a> “a backdoor attempt at weakening Texas’ laws.” He added: “The Biden administration’s motive is clear: to subvert lawful state investigations on issues that the courts have said the states may investigate.”</p><p>Officials with the federal Health and Human Services Department did not comment on the lawsuit, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-privacy-records-texas-lawsuit-9574df658a3336ab8ad28c31a2f79821" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">but told The Associated Press</a> that the Biden administration “remains committed to protecting reproductive health privacy and ensuring that no woman’s medical records are used against her.”</p><p>The April regulation came in direct response to abortion bans enacted by many Republican state legislatures after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. A number of those states, including Texas and Alabama, have signaled their interest in extending those bans to include women who cross state lines to get an abortion.</p><p>The lawsuit filed on Wednesday also asserts that the rule covers “hormone and drug therapy for gender dysphoria, surgical procedures related to gender dysphoria, and gender experimentation.” Texas bars minors from obtaining <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/02/politics/texas-gender-affirming-care-ban-minors/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gender-transition surgery and related care like hormone therapy</a>.</p><p>Whether Texas investigators have sought records of women who traveled out of state for abortions is unclear. But Mr. Paxton, a Republican, has demanded records on gender-transition care from organizations <a href="https://apnews.com/article/transgender-texas-lawsuit-youth-ede5b126e4f2f47fa179465c364f5549" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in Washington State and Georgia</a>. In March, a judge temporarily blocked Mr. Paxton from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/03/us/texas-paxton-transgender-records.html" title="">forcing an L.G.B.T.Q. organization</a> to turn over documents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Texas lawsuit could set off a protracted legal battle over both abortion and medical privacy rules. In June, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/us/politics/chevron-deference-decision-meaning.html" title="">overturned decades of legal precedent</a> that gave broad regulatory authority to federal agencies.</p><p>“Texas is arguing that the federal health agency doesn’t have the authority to determine what the scope of federal privacy is,” said David Donatti, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, which has been active in fighting the state’s restrictions on abortion.</p><p>“That’s remarkable both as a frontal assault on the ability of H.H.S. to define medical privacy,” he said, referring to the Health and Human Services Department. “But it also demonstrates the lengths that Texas is willing to go to to eliminate abortion and reproductive health access — not just in Texas, but across the country.”</p><p>Federal health officials have regularly worked with states on criminal inquiries into matters like fraud that touch on medical privacy issues. But Mr. Donatti said that investigations into attempts to obtain a legal abortion raised constitutional questions on issues like the freedom to travel that did not apply in other circumstances.</p><p>Other states have bristled at attempts to track women who seek abortions outside state boundaries. Nearly two dozen states with Democratic legislatures or governors have enacted laws or executive orders that shield women and their doctors from investigations by states with abortion bans.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Wines is a national correspondent, writing about voting and election issues.
