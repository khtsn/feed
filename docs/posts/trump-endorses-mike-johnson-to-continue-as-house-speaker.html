Trump endorsed Mike Johnson for another term as House speaker on Monday, roughly two weeks after Mr. Trump helped put Mr. Johnson’s chances in jeopardy by sinking a bipartisan spending bill that the speaker had negotiated to avert a government shutdown.</p><p>The announcement from Mr. Trump on his website, Truth Social, ended days of private discussions by the president-elect and his allies about whether to try to save Mr. Johnson or find another option, as some conservatives have been agitating for.</p><p>House Republicans are set to choose a speaker on Friday, just three days before Mr. Trump’s Electoral College victory is certified by a joint session of Congress. Failure to have a speaker in place by then could delay the certification process and focus attention on the deep divisions within the narrow House Republican majority as Mr. Trump is seeking to pursue an ambitious agenda.</p><p>“The American people need IMMEDIATE relief from all of the destructive policies of the last Administration. Speaker Mike Johnson is a good, hard working, religious man,” Mr. Trump wrote in a discursive post that praised himself and his campaign, attacked Democrats and mocked the Rev. Al Sharpton, with whom he has a long and contentious history.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump said Mr. Johnson would “do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN. Mike has my Complete &amp; Total Endorsement. MAGA!!!” </p><p>A person close to Mr. Trump, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the fact that House Republicans bucked the president-elect on the debt limit demand gave Mr. Trump “a realization that there are people in the House who are problematic, and their names are not Mike Johnson.”</p><p>Mr. Trump and Mr. Johnson have been talking by phone regularly, and the speaker has told associates that the conversations have been warm and supportive.</p><p>Before making his endorsement on Monday, Mr. Trump had privately told people that Mr. Johnson had asked for his support, but that he was not sure he was going to back him. Mr. Trump and his advisers also told associates, though, that they did not see who else could get the 218 votes required to become speaker.</p><p>In private, Mr. Trump has complained that Mr. Johnson failed during the end-of-session negotiations this month to deliver on a key demand from the president-elect: that the spending legislation raise the debt ceiling to spare Mr. Trump from having to deal with the issue when he takes office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Trump had made that demand as Mr. Johnson negotiated for a new bipartisan compromise after a late effort by the president-elect and his ally, Elon Musk, to sink the previous deal that Mr. Johnson struck with Democrats. It was not clear whether Mr. Trump had discussed increasing the debt limit as a priority of his before he went public with his demand, or whether Mr. Johnson had given Mr. Trump’s team full insight into what the spending bill would contain.</p><p>Mr. Trump has complained that Mr. Johnson’s predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, agreed in May 2023 to a spending deal with modest cuts that also lifted the debt ceiling in negotiation with President Biden. He has also griped about Mr. Johnson not finding a way to spare Mr. Trump facing down a debt ceiling early in his next term.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a senior political correspondent reporting on the 2024 presidential campaign, down ballot races across the country and the investigations into former President Donald J.
