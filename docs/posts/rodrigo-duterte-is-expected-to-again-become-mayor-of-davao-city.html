The court also received deliveries of birthday cards. Lots and lots of them.</p><p>They were all for the newest inmate, Rodrigo Duterte, the former president of the Philippines, who turned 80 on March 28. He is accused of crimes against humanity, and he could spend the rest of his life in prison.</p><p>“The place was inundated with flowers, and I brought some of the mail out because they didn’t know what to do with it,” Nicholas Kaufman, Mr. Duterte’s lawyer, said in a telephone interview. He said he had left with three sacks of mail for Mr. Duterte that the court was unable to vet. In the Philippines, thousands of people dressed in the green associated with Mr. Duterte’s political party <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/world/asia/duterte-mayor-davao.html" title="">flooded the streets of Davao City</a>.</p><p>Mr. Duterte, who ordered a brutal antidrug campaign in which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/07/world/asia/rodrigo-duterte-philippines-drugs-killings.html" title="">tens of thousands of people died</a> during his presidency, remains very popular in the Philippines. With Filipinos voting in midterm elections on Monday, he is expected to win another term as mayor of Davao City, his eighth, by a landslide. For now, he remains eligible for office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Duterte’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/world/asia/icc-philippines-rodrigo-duterte.html" title="">sudden arrest and extradition</a> to The Hague in March has sharply divided the Philippines. While some polls show that a majority of Filipinos back the international investigation, many of Mr. Duterte’s supporters believe that he is a victim of political persecution by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., once an ally of the Duterte clan.</p><p>Soon after Mr. Duterte’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/world/asia/philippines-rodrigo-duterte-arrest.html" title="">dramatic arrest</a>, Mr. Marcos’s <a href="https://asianews.network/philippine-president-marcos-approval-trust-ratings-fall-vp-dutertes-numbers-go-up/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">approval rating plummeted</a> to 25 percent from 42 percent a month earlier, in a survey conducted by Pulse Asia. But that of Sara Duterte — the current vice president and daughter of Mr. Duterte — rose to 59 percent from 52 percent.</p><p>Ms. Duterte has long been considered a future presidential candidate. But this election, in which half the Senate is up for grabs, could prove pivotal for her. She has been impeached on charges that include corruption, plotting to assassinate Mr. Marcos, involvement in the drug war killings and incitement to insurrection, and the country’s 24 senators will decide this summer whether to convict her.</p><p>In Davao, where Mr. Duterte remains beloved after 22 years as mayor, his dynasty is thriving. A son, Sebastian, who is likely to win the vice-mayoral race, is expected to act as mayor if his father wins. At least seven members of his family could join the local government.</p><p>For the first time ever, three political families — the Nograleses, the Garcias, and the Al-ags — are combining forces to challenge the Dutertes, their former political ally, in Davao. But even Bernie Al-ag — who is now running against Sebastian Duterte — said he was unhappy about Rodrigo Duterte’s arrest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I also look at him as a father figure,” said Mr. Al-ag, who is a former vice mayor of Davao. “I continue to pray for him.”</p><p>Mags Maglana, an N.G.O. worker who is running for a congressional seat against Paolo Duterte, another of Mr. Duterte’s sons, said that before Mr. Duterte’s arrest, people in Davao could differentiate between the patriarch and those around him.</p><p>But she is now concerned that “the outpouring of sympathy for the father would cascade over to the rest of the family.”</p><p>Mr. Duterte’s camp has used his case in The Hague as a campaign tool. At a rally in Manila on Thursday, a video of his arrest was played. His supporters wore T-shirts and carried posters that said: “BRING HIM HOME.” Ms. Duterte told the attendees that the country was “paying the price for electing the wrong leader.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Duterte remains beloved in Davao after serving for 22 years as mayor.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eloisa Lopez/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“What’s even more painful is that they managed to kidnap the former president and hurriedly threw him into another country to be tried by foreigners,” she said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>That other country, the Netherlands, is far removed from the life that Mr. Duterte is used to.</p><p>The first issue was the food. (It is unclear what exactly is served in the detention facility but Liberia’s former president, Charles Taylor, once complained that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/world/africa/15hague.html" title="">food was too “Eurocentric”</a>.)</p><p>Fadi El Abdallah, an I.C.C. spokesman, said the court did not comment on matters related to the private life of detainees.</p><p>Mr. Duterte said he was “not used” to the meals on offer, according to Mr. Kaufman, prompting the lawyer to request “culturally appropriate food.” For Mr. Duterte, that is rice — which he is getting now, according to Ms. Duterte.</p><p>“That’s what we asked for and it’s cooked perfectly,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrY9hfp3vpA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ms. Duterte told reporters</a> at The Hague earlier. “Correct according to Filipino taste.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Duterte’s family was allowed to supply him with groceries including his much-needed Coke Zero, according to Ms. Duterte. She told reporters that he had complained about why he was only getting Coke Zero once a day, and that he needed at least two cans a day.</p><p>Life is regimented. Mr. Duterte huddles with Mr. Kaufman every morning in a conference room. In the afternoon, he meets with some family members. He’s allowed time to exercise in a gym that is set up with a court to play <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/Publications/DetentionCentreENG.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">basketball</a>, <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/Publications/DetentionCentreENG.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tennis and badminton</a>. There is another communal space with a foosball table. He is one of <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/defendants?f%5B0%5D=accused_states%3A330" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">six people in custody</a>, according to court records.</p><p>According to Ms. Duterte, her father, who is diabetic, has nurses monitoring him. He has access to library books and a computer that allows him to review his defense filings but is not connected to the internet. In the late mornings or afternoons, he’s allowed to make telephone calls to numbers that have been vetted in advance. He has a television so he can watch the news.</p><p>“Jokingly, some people refer to it as a five star Hilton,” Mr. Kaufman said. “But it’s still prison.”</p><p>The small detention facility is within a Dutch prison in The Hague. The first head of state to be held there was Ivory Coast’s Laurent Gbagbo. He was acquitted along with another Ivorian political leader, Charles Blé Goudé, who was represented by Mr. Kaufman.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/CourtRecords/0902ebd180b6799a.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a filing to the court</a> earlier this month, Mr. Kaufman argued that there was no legal basis for the case against Mr. Duterte because the Philippines was no longer a state party to the Rome Statute — the treaty that forms the basis for the court’s legal authority — when the court allowed an investigation in to the drug war in September 2021. His lawyers called for Mr. Duterte’s immediate and unconditional release.</p><p>A hearing for the confirmation of charges is scheduled for Sept. 23.</p><p>In Davao, dozens of volunteers have camped out in front of Mr. Duterte’s house since his arrest. Janice Mahipus, 45, an online seller, said she had been sleeping outside the house, first on cartons on the floor and then on a bed a few meters away.</p><p>“We will never get tired waiting for him,” she said.</p><p>Aie Balagtas See<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sui-Lee Wee is the Southeast Asia bureau chief for The Times, overseeing coverage of 11 countries in the region.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
