I thought it would be a really nice pet.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>She had never worked with farm animals, but she was suddenly determined to learn and enrolled in online classes from providers such as the Cornell Small Farms Program, University of Vermont Extension and Michigan State University Extension.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-5"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/29/01small-anna-11-tpwj-cover/01small-anna-11-tpwj-cover-square640.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/29/01small-anna-11-tpwj-cover/01small-anna-11-tpwj-cover-square640.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/10/29/128755_1_01small-anna-11-tpwj_wg_mobile_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It didn’t take long for Ms. Lanneaux to realize that looking after sheep required more time and resources than a family pet did, as well as a farm. But, she was undaunted. “It just struck me as a good challenge,” she said. “Once I started to dig into it, I was fascinated.”</p><p>At the end of 2020, she closed on 60 wooded acres in Pomfret, Vt., for $385,000, sight unseen, with a plan to establish a small sheep farm, now named <a href="https://www.sajimafarm.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sajima Farm</a>. Over the following months, she took stock of the property and cleared five acres to seed a pasture.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sliding panels in the floor reveal a sunken bathtub and queen-size bed.  </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Oliver Parini for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Today, she has not one, but six sheep — two Babydoll Southdowns, and four Merinos. She also acquired a llama to guard the flock, and chickens, all of which require constant care.</p><p>In the early days, Ms. Lanneaux slept in the back of her Ford F-150 truck.

With an interest in design, Ms. Lanneaux saw a story about <a href="https://www.cabin-anna.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cabin ANNA</a> — a shape-shifting cabin developed by the Dutch designer Caspar Schols and built from prefabricated parts — and was smitten.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-14"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Lanneaux chose a building site that would take maximum advantage of the view.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Oliver Parini for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The cabin is assembled from prefabricated components and includes a compact kitchen.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Oliver Parini for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>The cabin has roof-and-wall modules on tracks that allow the structure to function as a cozy 300-square-foot shelter when closed, or to expand to a larger, 500-square-foot structure with a glass-walled solarium or open-air section, depending on the weather. Panels in the floor also slide back to reveal a sunken bathtub and a queen-size bed. A loft measuring about 80 square feet provides space for a second bed.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cabin ANNA is the creation of the Dutch designer Caspar Schols.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Oliver Parini for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Mr. Schols said the idea for Cabin ANNA came from a cabin he designed for his mother, to help her reconnect with nature.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>“Cabin ANNA is a receptacle for the environment,” he said. “It’s a tool to listen, look, feel, smell and take the environment in.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“To be mindful of your body in space, quiet your mind and be aware of your surroundings, the cabin is perfect for that,” Ms. Lanneaux said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Oliver Parini for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Ms. Lanneaux ordered her cabin this past February. After building and shipping it, Mr. Schols traveled to Vermont to personally oversee assembly in September. The base cost of the cabin was 437,000 euros ($470,000), but Ms. Lanneaux said building the foundation, shipping and installation expenses, and running utilities brought the total to $777,000.</p><p>Each unit is crafted in the Netherlands from metal and wood. Ms. Lanneaux’s cabin has a black-stained European Douglas fir exterior and Oregon pine interior. Most people place the cabin on a helical pile foundation, Mr. Schols said, but Ms. Lanneaux chose a full concrete foundation to contain a heat pump and water heater and to help keep the cabin from freezing in winter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>One section, with glass walls and ceiling, can make the center of the structure a solarium.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Oliver Parini for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Ms. Lanneaux is not alone in finding Cabin ANNA intriguing. Mr. Schols said he has built 15 so far, including some that are available for <a href="https://www.holenberg.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">short-term rental</a> in the Netherlands, and a recently completed project in<strong> </strong>Turkey. Ms. Lanneaux’s cabin is the first in the United States, but Mr. Schols is already at work on more, including one cabin currently being assembled in South Carolina, and upcoming projects in New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Texas, California and Hawaii.</p><p>Now that Ms. Lanneaux’s cabin is in place, “it’s even better than I imagined,” she said on a recent morning, while awaiting the final connection of utilities. “It’s going to work so well here. It looks like it was meant for this.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
