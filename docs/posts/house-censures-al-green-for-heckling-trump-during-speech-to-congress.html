Mr. Green and Representative Shomari Figures, a first-term Democrat from Alabama, both voted “present.”</p><p>But when Mr. Green stepped into the well of the House to receive his official scolding, the floor devolved once again into a scene of chaos. The Texas Democrat led a crowd of his colleagues in singing the gospel anthem “We Shall Overcome” as Speaker Mike Johnson raised his voice and finished reading out the censure.</p><p>Mr. Johnson was forced to call a brief recess as Republicans and Democrats lingered on the floor, shouting at each other. It was another dramatic moment after Mr. Green’s outburst on Tuesday night, reflecting a determination among some Democrats to aggressively resist Mr. Trump, even as others in the party <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/democrats-trump-al-green-protests-congress.html" title="">urge a more staid and sober strategy for pushing back</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Democrats who voted to censure Mr. Green were: Representatives Ami Bera of California, Ed Case of Hawaii, Jim Costa of California, Laura Gillen of New York, Jim Himes of Connecticut, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, Jared Moskowitz of Florida, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington and Tom Suozzi of New York.</p><p>A censure is one of the highest forms of reprimand in the House. The resolution is a formal and public condemnation or disapproval of a member’s individual behavior. But in recent years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/08/us/politics/censure-impeachment-congress-republicans-biden.html" title="">the bar for such moves has lowered considerably</a>, as Democrats and Republicans alike have used it to settle political scores.</p><p>The last member to be censured by the House was former Representative Jamaal Bowman, Democrat of New York, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/07/us/politics/jamaal-bowman-censure-fire-alarm.html" title="">received the rebuke in 2023</a> after he pulled a fire alarm in a Capitol office building during a critical vote, leading Republicans to accuse him of deliberately trying to stall business on the floor.</p><p>Mr. Green told reporters on Wednesday that he would accept the consequences for his actions on Tuesday night and that he harbored no ill will toward the speaker or anyone else.</p><p>“I didn’t do it to get anybody else to join me,” he said. “I believe that on some issues, it’s better to stand alone than not stand at all.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Green added that his act of protest was “a matter of conscience” because he believed Mr. Trump did not adequately address the issue of protecting Medicaid, a program that he said many of his constituents rely on.</p><p>“I would do it again,” he said. “I’m not saying I’m going to now contrive and try to find a way to do it again.”</p><p>Annie Karni<!-- --> and <!-- -->Robert Jimison<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>P</strong><strong>anama Canal</strong><strong> Ports</strong><strong>:</strong> An investor group led by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/business/blackrock-panama-canal-ports-hutchison.html">BlackRock will acquire two ports near the Panama Canal</a> that are owned by CK Hutchison, a Hong Kong conglomerate, and that have been the subject of a dispute between President Trump and Panama.</p></li><li><p><strong>Foreign Aid</strong><strong>:</strong> The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/foreign-aid-supreme-court-trump.html">rejected Trump’s emergency request to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid</a> as part of his efforts to slash government spending.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Properties:</strong> The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/trump-federal-property-buildings-sale.html">identified more than 440 federal properties</a> that could be sold off.
