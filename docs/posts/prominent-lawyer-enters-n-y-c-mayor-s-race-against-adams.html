If Mr. Adams were to resign, party affiliation would not matter since a special election would be nonpartisan.</p><p>Mr. Walden said in an interview that corruption was a pressing campaign issue, though he declined to comment on the indictment and said that Mr. Adams had a right to defend himself.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Whether it’s the Adams administration or many, many other administrations, corruption is a huge problem,” he said, adding that he would offer a detailed plan to “tackle graft in a way that no one has ever thought of before.”</p><p>Mr. Walden will occupy a distinct lane in the field: The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-nyc-mayor-succession.html" title="">five Democrats who have announced mayoral campaigns</a> are all to the left of Mr. Adams, a centrist. They are also practiced politicians, and Mr. Walden has never run for office.</p><p>He is also not a household name and will have to move quickly to introduce himself to New Yorkers and to raise money. He said he would invest $500,000 of his own money in his campaign as a loan to get started.</p><p>Mr. Walden said that name recognition would not be a problem and that he was well known in many communities.</p><p>He has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/nyregion/lawyer-walden-cuomo-de-blasio-nyc.html" title="">involved in major New York City cases</a> with political implications, including securing $250 million for public housing tenants in 2018. He also represented a Fire Department official who <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/investigations/fdny-chief-allegedly-pressured-to-approve-turkish-consulate-building-despite-safety-concerns/4867866/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused Mr. Adams of pressuring him to approve a Turkish Consulate project</a> that is part of the indictment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“For those communities that don’t yet know me, I guarantee that they know some cases that I worked on,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Walden, who said he left the Democratic Party in 2006, described himself as “nonideological” and mentioned several issues that are important to him, including transgender rights.</p><p>“There are some issues on which I am more progressive-leaning, and there are other issues where I’m more in the center,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Walden, 58, who lives in Brooklyn Heights, cut his teeth <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/22/nyregion/public-lives-a-prosecutor-even-the-mobsters-respect.html" title="">prosecuting narcotics and mob cases</a> at the United States attorney’s office in the Eastern District. In 2015, he started a boutique law firm and <a href="https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2024/09/10/jim-walden-steps-aside-as-litigation-firm-creates-new-management-structure/?slreturn=20241023172520" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced recently that he would hand over leadership</a> to a committee.</p><p>He represented Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-kennedy-rfk-election-ballot-new-york-d21f68c68078b20c058bfad1c0f67661" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">case over ballot access in the presidential race</a> and a group <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-new-york-government-and-politics-redistricting-276437ba07aa6e299c4c3989ab80461b" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">challenging New York State Assembly election maps</a> in 2022. In 2018, he also settled with the city’s Education Department in a sprawling class-action lawsuit filed by parents over bullying, leading to changes for students.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Some of his cases have been contentious among some left-leaning Democrats: He faced criticism for representing opponents of a bicycle lane along Prospect Park West in Brooklyn.</p><p>He said he has recruited 30 policy advisers for his campaign, and created an anti-corruption committee led by Daniel R. Alonso, a former federal and state prosecutor.</p><p>“I’ve rarely met someone as idealistic about the power of government to solve people’s problems, and he’s never been partisan in that pursuit,” Mr. Alonso said.</p><p>As an illustration of Mr. Walden’s ideological distance from New York’s left-wing leaders, he criticized the City Council over how it treated his mentor, Randy Mastro, a top aide to former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani who was nominated to serve as corporation counsel under Mr. Adams.</p><p>Mr. Walden said their attacks on Mr. Mastro were “deeply offensive to every lawyer that does pro bono work to be essentially vilified for trying to help people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Marianne Pizzitola, president of the New York City Organization of Public Service Retirees, which represents roughly 250,000 retirees, said that Mr. Walden’s firm was representing the group in a <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2023/07/07/judge-temporarily-blocks-mayor-adams-from-switching-nyc-retirees-to-medicare-advantage/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">legal fight</a> over health care, and he had been an ally. She said that retirees would support his campaign.</p><p>“He seems to be a unique candidate — his ideology is not locked into traditional politics,” she said.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
