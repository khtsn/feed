The mayor’s intention to sue was first reported by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/14/adams-trump-migrant-grants-00204470" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Politico</a> on Friday.</p><p>The decision by Mr. Adams to take a legal stand against the Trump administration on an immigration-related issue comes at a critical moment for the mayor, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/nyregion/eric-adams-resignation-future.html?smid=url-share" title="">who this week faced mounting calls to resign</a> after Manhattan’s acting U.S. attorney, Danielle R. Sassoon, accused him of trading concessions on immigration policy for the dismissal of the corruption charges against him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Monday, the Justice Department’s No. 2 official, Emil Bove III, ordered Manhattan prosecutors to drop the case against Mr. Adams.</p><p>Mr. Bove said the move had nothing to do with the case’s legal strengths, but rather that its prosecution would impede Mr. Adams’s ability to cooperate with the Trump administration’s immigration policies, a highly unusual justification for dropping criminal charges.</p><p>The order prompted days of crisis inside the Justice Department, with Ms. Sassoon refusing to obey and eventually resigning on Thursday, and at least six other prosecutors in New York and Washington following suit.</p><p>On Friday night, Mr. Bove himself signed the request asking a judge to dismiss the charges.</p><p>Mr. Adams has refuted that he traded his authority for an end to his case, but he has struggled to dispel rising fears from New Yorkers that he is indeed cooperating.</p><p>On Thursday, the mayor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/nyregion/adams-ice-rikers-homan.html" title="">said he would allow</a> federal immigration authorities to operate within the Rikers Island jail complex. And, in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/nyregion/adams-homan-fox-interview.html" title="">joint appearance</a> on “Fox and Friends” with President Trump’s border czar, Thomas Homan, Friday morning, he described his support for working with the White House to deport immigrants accused of committing crimes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At one point, Mr. Homan said he would make sure Mr. Adams complied. If not, he said: “I’ll be in his office, up his butt, saying, ‘Where the hell is the agreement we came to?’”</p><p>Mr. Adams’s willingness to sue the federal government amid his ongoing legal saga raises questions about the lengths to which he is willing to go to enforce President Trump’s immigration agenda. But it also underscores the drastic nature of the Trump administration’s $80 million clawback, which appears to be one of the first known cases in which the Trump administration has seized back congressionally appropriated funds from a locality.</p><p>The lawsuit is the latest development in a fight over FEMA’s funding to shelter migrants, which has played out amid Mr. Adams’s legal drama.</p><p>On Monday, Elon Musk wrote a <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1888891512303263815" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">misleading post on X</a> claiming that FEMA had sent $59 million intended for disaster relief to New York City to pay for luxury hotels to house migrants. That claim is not accurate; the funds were appropriated by Congress last year under President Biden and issued by FEMA through grants from its <a href="https://www.fema.gov/grants/preparedness/shelter-services-program/fy24-awards/ssp-a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shelter and Services Program</a>, which does not support disaster relief. The city has also stressed that it is not paying luxury hotel rates.</p><p>A few hours after Mr. Musk’s post, however, FEMA’s acting director, Cameron Hamilton, <a href="https://x.com/FEMA_Cam/status/1888921176199635266" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced that the payments</a> in question had been suspended and on Tuesday, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/nyregion/fema-fired-nyc-migrant-hotels.html" title="">announced the firing</a> of four agency employees involved in distributing the money. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/climate/fema-funds-nyc-migrant-shelters-judge-ruling.html" title="">federal judge has since ruled</a> that FEMA is allowed to seek a pause in the funding, though the abrupt clawback of the funds appears to be atypical.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Wednesday morning, city leaders said they noticed that the $80 million in FEMA funds had suddenly disappeared from city accounts. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the agency, later confirmed that it had taken the money back.</p><p>The city was also charged a $15,000 overdraft fee because of the loss of funds, according to Ms. Garcia, the mayor’s spokeswoman, though the fee was later waived, she said.</p><p>The clawback of congressionally appropriated funds has shocked city officials, who this week questioned the legality of the move and urged the mayor to take a stand against Mr. Trump.</p><p>Brad Lander, the city’s comptroller who is running in June’s Democratic mayoral primary, sent a <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/statement-from-nyc-comptroller-lander-demanding-legal-action-by-the-law-department-in-response-to-the-seizure-of-fema-funds/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">letter</a> to the Law Department on Friday calling on Mr. Adams to pursue “aggressive legal action” against Mr. Trump over the clawback and offering to do so himself if the mayor “would prefer to spend his days advancing President Trump’s agenda instead of fighting for New Yorkers.”</p><p>In the Law Department’s response announcing its intention to sue, it declined Mr. Lander’s offer for external legal counsel. The mayor’s office said separately that Mr. Lander was not involved in the department’s decision.</p><p>Dana Rubinstein<!-- --> and <!-- -->Luis Ferré-Sadurní<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maia Coleman writes about breaking news and the criminal justice system in New York City and its surrounding areas.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maia-coleman">More about Maia Coleman</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
