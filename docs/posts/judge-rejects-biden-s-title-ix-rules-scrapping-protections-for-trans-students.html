It arrived just days before those protections were likely to face more scrutiny under a Trump administration that is expected to be hostile to the new rules and could refuse to defend them in court.</p><p>In <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.kyed.104801/gov.uscourts.kyed.104801.143.0_1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 15-page opinion</a>, Chief Judge Danny C. Reeves of the Eastern District of Kentucky wrote that the Education Department could not lawfully expand the definition of Title IX to prohibit discrimination based on gender identity, as it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/us/politics/biden-title-ix-rules.html" title="">proposed last year</a>.</p><p>“The entire point of Title IX is to prevent discrimination based on sex,” he wrote. “Throwing gender identity into the mix eviscerates the statute and renders it largely meaningless.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In April, the administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/us/politics/biden-title-ix-rules.html" title="">announced a revised version of Title IX</a>, the 1972 law that prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs receiving federal funding, that applied more explicitly to transgender students. While it stopped short of some major changes — such as requiring schools to accommodate transgender students in single-sex dorms or sports teams — it generally prohibited schools and their staff from rejecting a student’s gender identity in most everyday contexts.</p><p>The changes ran into immediate opposition from Republican states, which filed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/us/politics/biden-title-ix-gender-sex-discrimination.html" title="">legal challenges</a>, including one brought by Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia and West Virginia that led to the decision on Thursday. Through that case and others, the rule had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/us/politics/biden-title-ix-gender-sex-discrimination.html" title="">temporarily blocked in 26 states</a> while state attorneys general and policy groups opposing the changes fought the Education Department over their specifics.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
