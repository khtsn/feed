The budget plan also withdraws financial support for Gavi, the international vaccine alliance that purchases vaccines for children in developing countries.</p><p>Overall, the budget request explicitly follows President Trump’s America First policy, slashing funds for global health programs that fight H.I.V. and malaria, and cutting support altogether to fight diseases that affect only poorer countries.</p><p>“The request eliminates funding for programs that do not make Americans safer, such as family planning and reproductive health, neglected tropical diseases, and nonemergency nutrition,” the proposal said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Many public health experts said that such thinking is flawed because infectious diseases routinely breach borders. The United States is battling multiple measles outbreaks, prompting the C.D.C. last week <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/measles-globe" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to warn travelers</a> about the risks of contracting measles. Each of those outbreaks began with a case of measles contracted by an international traveler.</p><p>“Every single measles case this year is related to actual importations of the virus into the United States,” said Dr. Walter Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center and a former director of the United States’ Immunization Program.</p><p>A case of polio <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/health/polio-vaccine-outbreaks.html" title="">in an unvaccinated adult</a> in New York in 2022 was also linked to importation of the virus from a country where it still circulates.</p><p>Ultimately, it is up to Congress to determine the budget, and, as in previous years, many of the president’s proposals could be changed or discarded. Lawmakers are only starting to embark on the annual process. The current fiscal year expires at the end of September.</p><p>Gavi is in talks with administration officials and members of Congress to try to restore the organization’s funding, according to a spokeswoman for the organization.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“I think the world has forgotten those days when graveyards used to be full of graves of children that died of measles, that died of diphtheria, that died of simple infectious diseases,” Dr. Sania Nishtar, Gavi’s chief executive, said in an interview. “There is so much at stake.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A health worker administering a polio vaccine to a child at a school in Lahore, Pakistan, in April.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">K.M. Chaudry/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Measles, polio and other diseases have resurged around the world, in part because of disruptions to immunization campaigns during the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as misinformation that percolated during the pandemic.</p><p>Polio seemed tantalizingly close to eradication a couple of years ago, but new cases have sprung up in dozens of countries this year, including in Papua New Guinea, which was declared polio-free 25 years ago.</p><p>An estimated 3.2 million children in the World Health Organization’s Western Pacific Region, which includes Papua New Guinea, did not receive a single dose of vaccine between 2020 and 2023. This year, several countries in the region, including Cambodia, the Philippines and Vietnam, are reporting the highest number of measles cases since 2020, according to the W.H.O.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network, which comprises more than 700 labs in more than 150 countries, is at risk of imminent closure, precipitated by the Trump administration’s decision to stop funding it. So is the W.H.O.’s National Public Health Support Network, which monitors immunization for polio, measles and other diseases in India.</p><p>“The U.S. has been extremely generous over many years, and is of course within its rights to decide what it supports, and to what extent,” said Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the W.H.O. </p><p>“But the scale, scope, and abrupt nature of the U.S. cuts will lead to more disease and death, and countries have not been able to plan a sufficient transition,” he said. “We hope the U.S. will reconsider and continue their legacy of leadership in global health.”</p><p>The polio eradication effort faces a 40 percent budget deficit in 2026, Dr. Hanan Balkhy, a senior WHO official, told the World Health Assembly in Geneva last month.</p><p>“We are at a tipping point,” she said. “Either we invest now to finish the job or risk a global resurgence.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Trump administration has also canceled contracts that support local health systems and disease surveillance for malaria, said Martin Edlund, chief executive of the advocacy group Malaria No More. </p><p>The budget proposes to cut funding for the U.S. President’s Malaria Initiative, a program to fight the disease around the world, by 47 percent. The proposal leaves flexibility for the State Department to support the Global Fund, which finances the majority of the campaigns worldwide against H.I.V., <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/world/africa/malaria-vaccine-africa.html" title="">malaria</a> and tuberculosis, but says that the U.S. should contribute $1 for every $4 from other donors instead of the current $1 for every $2. </p><p>Mr. Edlund said that the change “will undoubtedly have a chilling effect on other donors.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters laid down caskets in Washington, D.C., after PEPFAR funding was cut in April.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Allison Robbert for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The 2026 budget proposes just under $3 billion for the program, less than half its previous funding. On Tuesday, the Trump administration also asked Congress to approve clawbacks of $9.4 billion from programs, including PEPFAR, that were already authorized for 2025.</p><p>PEPFAR is credited <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/14/health/pepfar-hiv.html" title="">with having saved more than 20 million lives</a> since its inception in 2003, and is widely regarded as the most successful global health campaign in history.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the federal Office of Management and Budget said the president’s proposed budget “prioritizes lifesaving global health activities, including PEPFAR treatment for those on lifesaving medications and global health security to prevent infectious diseases from reaching our homeland, while eliminating programs that do not serve Americans and where other countries and donors should be contributing their fair share.”</p><p>She added that the budget eliminates programs that focus on transgender and L.G.B.T.Q. people as well as “programs that have supported abortions.” She did not address questions about immunization programs.</p><p>The budget references a “responsible off-ramp” for PEPFAR, aiming to transfer control of H.I.V. programs to recipient countries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“In effect, the administration is signaling an intent to wind down the most successful U.S. global H.I.V. initiative in history,” said Jirair Ratevosian, who served as chief of staff for PEPFAR during the Biden administration.</p><p>He praised the proposal’s embrace of artificial intelligence and long-acting H.I.V. prevention technologies, as well as the explicit call for handoff to countries.</p><p>“But these transitions cannot succeed atop weakened or dismantled infrastructure,” he said. Coupled with the deep cuts proposed, “this approach risks hollowing out the very systems needed for a successful handover.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Apoorva Mandavilli reports on science and global health for The Times, with a focus on infectious diseases and pandemics and the public health agencies that try to manage them.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
