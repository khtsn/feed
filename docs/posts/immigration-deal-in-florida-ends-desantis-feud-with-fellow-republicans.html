Ron DeSantis, ending <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/desantis-florida-trump-immigration.html" title="">a tense, two-week standoff</a> and allowing both sides to save face in front of voters who consider illegal immigration a top issue.</p><p>The rift had exposed an unusual power struggle among the state’s top Republicans and led to frenzied intraparty attacks on social media, which legislative leaders denounced in strong terms on Tuesday.</p><p>As part of the compromise, no single elected official — the governor, as Mr. DeSantis wanted, or the agriculture commissioner, as lawmakers preferred — will be Florida’s chief immigration officer. Instead, the governor, the agriculture commissioner, the attorney general and the chief financial officer will all sit on a new state board of immigration enforcement. The board’s decisions will have to be unanimous.</p><p>The setup works to Mr. DeSantis’s advantage for now, as he will soon appoint a new attorney general and chief financial officer; both jobs opened up after President Trump took office and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/desantis-republicans-immigration-florida.html" title="">named several Florida Republicans</a> to his administration. The governor is expected to pick close allies to fill the roles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. DeSantis had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/desantis-veto-immigration-bill.html" title="">threatened to veto</a> the immigration bill that the State Legislature passed last month, calling them “weak, weak, weak.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sheriff Ric Bradshaw of Palm Beach County, left, with Mr. DeSantis at a round table on immigration law earlier this year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cristobal Herrera-Ulashkevich/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The rewritten legislation, if passed, “will make Florida the strongest state in the country for combating illegal immigration,” Mr. DeSantis said in a video <a href="https://x.com/GovRonDeSantis/status/1889109915454632155" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted to X</a> late on Monday, after the deal was announced.</p><p>Republican legislative leaders can also claim victory: Mr. DeSantis did not get everything he wanted and was forced to negotiate with them, a rare occurrence for a governor who has exercised expansive power despite doing little to nurture legislative relationships within his own party.</p><p>“Governor, we’ve gotten to know each other better in the last three weeks than in the last six years,” Daniel Perez, the House speaker, said on Tuesday from the chamber floor, where he opened a new special legislative session to consider the three compromise bills. Mr. Perez said he expected the legislation to pass by Thursday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The legislation would provide $250 million (down from $500 million in the initial package) for local police departments to help enforce federal immigration efforts. Local jails run by county officials — not just by sheriffs’ departments, as it is now — would have to participate in programs assisting federal agencies with enforcement. The governor could suspend local officials who do not comply.</p><p>The legislation would also make it a state crime for unauthorized immigrants to enter Florida. Such immigrants would automatically be denied bail if arrested.</p><p>As with the earlier legislation, unauthorized immigrants convicted of a capital offense would automatically be sentenced to death. And Florida would end its policy allowing residents to pay in-state tuition at public universities if they were brought into the country illegally as children.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From left, President Trump, his son Eric Trump, Gov.

Núñez, a Republican lawmaker from Miami, who later became Mr. DeSantis’s lieutenant governor. She backed the policy’s repeal in a <a href="https://x.com/LtGovNunez/status/1883150780544282691" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a> last month; last week, she was named interim president of Florida International University, an appointment that will require her to resign as lieutenant governor and allow Mr. DeSantis to choose her replacement.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. DeSantis did not win lawmakers’ support for a plan to stop unauthorized immigrants from sending money back to their home countries. He also lost control over a state program that in 2022 paid to recruit and fly several dozen undocumented immigrants <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/02/us/migrants-marthas-vineyard-desantis-texas.html" title="">to Martha’s Vineyard, in Massachusetts</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump did not publicly weigh in on policy specifics during the standoff, despite overtures from Mr. DeSantis and legislative leaders. Both sides claimed their proposals were more aligned with what the president wanted.</p><p>Mr. Trump encouraged Mr. DeSantis’s call for a special legislative session on immigration enforcement last month. But he remained silent after lawmakers titled their bill the “Tackling and Reforming Unlawful Migration Policy Act” — that is, the TRUMP Act — and said they had received “technical assistance from the White House” in drafting it.</p><p>Legislative leaders, however, never formally sent Mr. DeSantis the legislation after they passed it. A compromise package emerged only after days of finger-pointing and bickering on social media. As Mr. DeSantis publicly ridiculed the idea of putting the agriculture commissioner, Wilton Simpson, in charge of immigration enforcement, threats against Mr. Simpson emerged, according to Ben Albritton, the Senate president.</p><p>“These threats are un-American,” he said in extended remarks from the Senate floor. “They’re just flat wrong.”</p><p>He pledged, however, that Republicans would work together moving forward: “A family squabble will not pull us apart.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patricia Mazzei is the lead reporter for The Times in Miami, covering Florida and Puerto Rico.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patricia-mazzei">More about Patricia Mazzei</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/ron-desantis">Ron DeSantis</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Suing Over Immigration Policies: </strong>San Francisco said that it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/san-francisco-sues-trump-sanctuary-cities.html">join several other cities in suing the Trump administration</a> over its efforts to get them to comply with its immigration policies.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Aid Agency’s Climate Programs: </strong>Aid projects were designed to help Central Americans withstand extreme weather at home. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/climate/us-aid-climate-migration.html">Ending them could undercut President Trump’s goal of reducing migration</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Immigrant Communities in Hiding: </strong>Across the country, schools, churches and shops are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/immigrant-communities-hiding-ice.html">feeling the chilling effect</a> of Trump’s deportation threats, as migrants alter their routines.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inside a Chaotic Deportation Flight: </strong>The Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/world/americas/us-brazil-deportations.html">first flight deporting Brazilians</a> involved aborted takeoffs, sweltering heat, emergency exits and shackled deportees on a wing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Asking Students’ Immigration Status: </strong>Oklahoma education leaders approved a plan to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/oklahoma-schools-immigration.html">request proof of citizenship or immigration status</a> from families when they enroll their children in public schools.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
