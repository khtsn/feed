It was the first time in months that he had disclosed military casualty figures, a highly sensitive topic in Ukraine, particularly as Kyiv’s forces lose more ground to Russian troops.</p><p>The Ukrainian leader’s tally could not be verified independently, and it differs sharply from estimates by U.S. officials and military analysts, who have put the number of dead much higher. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/18/us/politics/ukraine-russia-war-casualties.html" title="">U.S. officials</a> said in August 2023 that close to 70,000 soldiers had been killed, a figure that has probably increased significantly since then.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_XZUcBExag&amp;t=2767s&amp;ab_channel=%D0%91%D1%83%D1%82%D1%83%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%9F%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%81" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yuri Butusov</a>, a Ukrainian journalist with close ties to the army, shared a similar figure last week, adding that 35,000 soldiers were also missing in action.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky also noted that about half of the wounded soldiers return to the battlefield after treatment. This suggests that Ukraine has suffered a total of about 230,000 irreplaceable losses, comprising those killed and those permanently incapacitated by injuries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It was not immediately clear why Mr. Zelensky chose to release casualty figures now, but <a href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1865709519352873408" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his statement</a> came just a few hours after President-elect Donald J. Trump said that Ukraine had lost 400,000 soldiers, without specifying the number of dead or wounded. Mr. Trump, who also said that Russia’s casualties were close to 600,000 soldiers, said the high toll of the war underscored the need for an immediate cease-fire and the start of peace negotiations.</p><p>“I know Vladimir well,” Mr. Trump wrote Sunday <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113615912452824634" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on social media</a>, referring to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin. “This is his time to act. China can help. The World is waiting!” He urged Mr. Putin to begin negotiations and called on China, which has aligned itself with Russia on many issues, to join the process.</p><p>Ending the war was a major theme of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/world/europe/zelensky-trump-macron-notre-dame.html" title="">meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky in Paris on Saturday evening</a>, their first in-person encounter since Mr. Trump won the U.S. presidential election last month. Mr. Trump’s promise to end the war quickly has raised fears in Kyiv that it could leave Russia in control of about 20 percent of Ukraine’s territory and strong enough to start another all-out offensive.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/trump-says-ukraine-should-probably-prepare-to-receive-less-aid-from-u-s-226493509712" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview with NBC that aired Sunday</a>, Mr. Trump said he would “probably” reduce aid to Ukraine when he returns to the White House next month.</p><p>Ukrainian officials in recent weeks have sought to forge ties with Mr. Trump and his future administration to try to shape their plans to wrap up the conflict in a way that best aligns with Kyiv’s interests.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Referring to his conversation with Mr. Trump in Paris, Mr. Zelensky said Sunday afternoon on social media, where he revealed the casualty figures, “I stated that we need a just and enduring peace — one that the Russians will not be able to destroy in a few years, as they have done repeatedly in the past.”</p><p>Anticipating that the new Trump administration may cut off aid to Ukraine to force it to the negotiating table, the Biden administration is trying to expedite the remaining military assistance earmarked for Ukraine. Late on Saturday, the <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3989537/biden-administration-announces-new-security-assistance-package-for-ukraine/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Department of Defense</a> unveiled a $1 billion package for Ukraine that will provide funds to buy ammunition for rocket systems, drones and spare parts for maintaining artillery equipment.</p><p>But American officials and military analysts have repeatedly said in recent weeks that additional weapons and ammunition are not what Ukraine needs most now. Rather, they say, it needs to do a better job of replacing its battlefield losses, including by speeding up and expanding conscription. In particular, senior American officials have urged Kyiv to expand its draft to younger men aged 18 to 25, who are now exempt.</p><p>“Even with the money, even with the munitions, there have to be people on the front lines to deal with the Russian aggression,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-press-availability-55/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in Brussels last week</a>.</p><p>While Ukraine’s battlefield losses are dwarfed by Russia’s — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/world/europe/russia-troops-losses-ukraine.html" title="">estimated at up to 400,000 irreplaceable losses</a> — military analysts warn they are less sustainable for Kyiv because it has faced greater difficulties than Russia in replenishing its ranks.</p><p>Russia, trying to avoid a round of national conscription that could anger citizens, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/04/world/europe/russia-prison-wagner-ukraine.html" title="">sought to recruit heavily</a> from prisons and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/world/europe/russia-putin-birthrate.html" title="">volunteers</a>. Ukrainian and Western officials also estimate that North Korea sent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/world/europe/north-korea-russia-ukraine-kursk.html" title="">about 10,000 soldiers</a> to help Russia this year, as the countries leaders developed closer ties.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>6</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>43,000 Soldiers Killed Since Russian Invasion, Zelensky Says<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
