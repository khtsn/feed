    <h1>Trump Officials Pushed Ahead With Mass Layoffs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The federal work force is facing a sharp reduction after President Trump’s Office of Personnel Management ordered agencies to terminate most of an estimated 200,000 workers still in their probationary period. The cuts primarily target employees who have been in their roles for less than two years and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/politics/trump-federal-personnel-layoffs.html?" title="">do not enjoy as much job protection</a>.</p><p>By this afternoon, the scope of the layoffs was becoming clearer. More than 1,000 workers were terminated at the Department of Veterans Affairs and about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/us/politics/energy-department-layoffs.html" title="">1,000 more were let go at the Energy Department</a>. The Consumer Financial Protection and the personnel office itself each laid off dozens more. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/us/politics/irs-expected-to-lay-off-thousands.html" title="">The I.R.S. is expected to fire thousands of workers</a>.</p><p>The layoffs are part of an effort by Trump and a team led by Elon Musk to reshape the federal government, which employs about 2.3 million workers. This week, the administration also cut spending on groups that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/us/politics/trump-obamacare-navigators.html" title="">helped Americans enroll in Obamacare</a> and advanced diversity initiatives at the Education Department. During Trump’s first term, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/us/politics/trump-diversity-education-department.html" title="">education secretary had championed those efforts</a>.</p><p>The cuts seem likely to continue: The agriculture secretary said today that she would welcome Musk’s team to help assess her department’s spending, which includes food stamps. “Are we really giving people a hand up, or is it a handout?” the secretary said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Matthias Schrader/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-4303407e">Vance signaled support for Europe’s far-right parties</h2><p>Vice President JD Vance met with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine today at the Munich Security Conference. He said the U.S. was intent on securing “a durable, lasting peace” in Ukraine, but declined to discuss specifics.</p><p>Vance also gave a speech that many European diplomats and officials had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/world/europe/ukraine-russia-trump-munich.html" title="">hoped would clarify</a> the Trump administration’s vision for Ukraine. Instead, he told the Europeans that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/world/europe/vance-europe-immigration-ukraine.html" title="">their biggest security threat was “the enemy within</a>,” accusing them of suppressing free speech and sidelining parties considered extremist.</p><p>He singled out his German hosts, telling them to drop their objections to working with a party that has often reveled in banned Nazi slogans, which elicited some gasps in the hall. Vance did not mention the party, the Alternative for Germany or AfD, by name, but he did meet with its chancellor candidate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-4d165e69">Top Democrats called for Eric Adams to resign</h2><p>A growing number of elected officials in New York <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/nyregion/eric-adams-resignation-future.html" title="">called today for the resignation of Mayor Eric Adams</a>, one day after Danielle Sassoon, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, resigned rather than obey an order to drop a criminal case against the mayor. She accused Adams’s lawyers of suggesting to Trump’s aides that he would help with the president’s immigration crackdown if his indictment were dropped.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/14/us/doj-resignations-trump-adams.html" title="">Several other officials quit alongside Sassoon</a> in protest of the order, which came from a top Justice Department official. Hagan Scotten, the lead prosecutor on the case, said in a resignation letter: “I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion. But it was never going to be me.”</p><p><strong>The latest: </strong>Attorney General Pam Bondi said the case against Adams “is being dismissed today.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/14/nyregion/eric-adams-charges-doj" title="">Follow for updates</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rafter Adrian Simancas in Chilean Patagonia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dell Simancas, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-4ed62f47">A man in Chile was briefly ‘swallowed’ by a whale</h2><p>Adrián Simancas was rafting with his father in the waters of Chilean Patagonia when a humpback whale suddenly lunged at him, mouth open, from the waves below.
