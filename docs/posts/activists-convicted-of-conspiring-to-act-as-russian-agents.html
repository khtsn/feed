    <h1>Activists Convicted of Conspiring to Act as Russian Agents</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Uhuru Movement is the activist arm of the African People’s Socialist Party, an organization promoting Black power. The groups are based in St. Petersburg, Fla., and St. Louis; for decades, the Uhuru Movement has protested issues like racism, colonialism and policing.</p><p>At trial, prosecutors laid out how Mr. Yeshitela visited Moscow and established a long-term relationship with a Russian man who worked with the F.S.B., a Russian intelligence agency. From 2015 to 2022, prosecutors said, Russians directed and in some cases paid the Americans to push Russian propaganda.</p><p>The other defendants are Penny Joanne Hess, an Uhuru Movement leader; Jesse Nevel, an Uhuru Movement member; and Augustus C. Romain Jr., a former African People’s Socialist Party member and founder of Black Hammer, a radical Black separatist organization in Atlanta. Mr. Romain mostly represented himself at trial.</p><p>The trial, which had been scheduled to last for about four weeks, concluded more quickly than expected. The conspiracy conviction carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. No sentencing date has been set.</p></div></div>
