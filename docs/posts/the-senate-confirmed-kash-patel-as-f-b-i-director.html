    <h1>The Senate Confirmed Kash Patel as F.B.I. Director</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Fifty-one Republican senators voted today to narrowly confirm Kash Patel as the director of the F.B.I., <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/us/politics/kash-patel-trump-fbi-senate.html" title="">installing a loyal ally of President Trump</a> as the new leader of the nation’s premier law enforcement agency.</p><p>Patel, 44, has embraced politics to a degree that is extraordinary for an F.B.I. director in the post-Watergate era. He is also a hard-line critic of the bureau. “As a campaign surrogate,” our Justice Department reporter, Devlin Barrett, told me, “Patel vowed to empty F.B.I. headquarters, fire its leaders, and turn the building into a museum.”</p><p>“It’s safe to say there has never been a director like him,” Devlin said.</p><p>Democrats questioned Patel’s credentials and highlighted his embrace of conspiracy theories. But it’s his loyalty to the president — the exact <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/politics/kash-patel-trump-loyalty.html" title="">quality that seemed to secure him the job</a> — that most concerned many critics and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-kash-patel-fbi-independence.html" title="">raised questions about the F.B.I.’s independence</a>.</p><p>In an earlier era, Patel would have very likely had trouble surviving the confirmation process. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/20/us/politics/patel-senate-confirmation-vote.html" title="">just two Republican senators</a> — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine — joined every Democrat in voting against him, a sign of Trump’s hold over the party.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has been one of the few Republicans willing to vote against Trump’s nominees. But the 83-year-old former leader voted for Patel and announced today that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/us/politics/mitch-mcconnell-retire.html" title="">he planned to retire at the end of his term</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-2bc8fc2a">Trump’s first month was frenetic</h2><p>As of this afternoon, it’s been a month since Trump returned to the White House and set out to overhaul the federal government at a scale unseen in decades. Some of the changes are considered well within his authority; others appear to purposely violate statutes, setting up tests of presidential power. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/upshot/trump-executive-orders-legality.html" title="">We examined the legality of 38 of Trump’s biggest moves so far</a>.</p><p>He’s not done.

The fourth was that of Oded Lifshitz, who was 83.</p><p>The handoff was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-hostages-bodies.html" title="">a theatrical display that a senior U.N. official called “abhorrent and cruel.”</a> The coffins were placed on a stage in front of a cartoonish picture of Israel’s prime minister as triumphant music played.
