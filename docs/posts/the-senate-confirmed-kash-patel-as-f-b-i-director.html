He is also a hard-line critic of the bureau. “As a campaign surrogate,” our Justice Department reporter, Devlin Barrett, told me, “Patel vowed to empty F.B.I. headquarters, fire its leaders, and turn the building into a museum.”</p><p>“It’s safe to say there has never been a director like him,” Devlin said.</p><p>Democrats questioned Patel’s credentials and highlighted his embrace of conspiracy theories. But it’s his loyalty to the president — the exact <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/politics/kash-patel-trump-loyalty.html" title="">quality that seemed to secure him the job</a> — that most concerned many critics and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-kash-patel-fbi-independence.html" title="">raised questions about the F.B.I.’s independence</a>.</p><p>In an earlier era, Patel would have very likely had trouble surviving the confirmation process.
