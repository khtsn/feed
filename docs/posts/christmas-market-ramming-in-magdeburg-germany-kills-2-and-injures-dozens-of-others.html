He first came to Germany in 2006 and worked as a doctor in a small town 25 miles to the south of Magdeburg, officials said.</p><p>More than 65 people were injured, 14 of them severely, said Michael Reif, the spokesman for the city of Magdeburg. Mr. Reif and a regional government spokesman, Matthias Schuppe, both said they suspected the episode had been an attack, according to the German public broadcaster.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The authorities were working to determine a motive, said Reiner Haseloff, the governor of Saxony-Anhalt state, where Magdeburg is the capital.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“This is a terrible event, especially now in the days leading up to Christmas,” Mr. Haseloff told the German wire service D.P.A.</p><p>More than 1,000 temporary Christmas markets pop up every year in Germany, and they have been the target of terrorists in the past. In 2016, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/21/world/europe/berlin-christmas-market-attack.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">an extremist rammed a truck into a crowd in Berlin</a>, killing 13. Since then, the police have secured many Christmas markets with temporary barriers.</p><p>It remains unclear how the driver was able to circumvent the barriers that were protecting the market in Magdeburg. The car drove some 1,200 feet before it stopped, officials said.</p><p>The authorities said the driver had rented a car before plowing it into the market on the last Friday before Christmas, when it was especially crowded with visitors. Many police officers were at the site. The area around the market was closed after the episode, a police spokeswoman said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The city of Magdeburg, population 240,000, used to be part of Communist East Germany. The year’s Christmas market is in the old market square, just in front of City Hall.</p><p>Surveillance footage circulating on social media and verified by The New York Times on Friday shows a car plowing into a large crowd at the Christmas market. The car then turns right onto another crowded street. Video of the aftermath shows people helping the wounded as cries are heard.</p><p>“The reports from Magdeburg are alarming,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in <a href="https://x.com/Bundeskanzler/status/1870198262944158186" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media post.</a> “My thoughts are with the victims and their families.”</p><p>Arijeta Lajka<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Christopher F.
