Trump’s name.</p><p>Instead, in the final hours of the race, she argued that her candidacy was focused on the future.</p><p>“Our campaign has not been about being against something, it is about being for something,” she said. “A fight for a future with freedom and opportunity and dignity for all Americans.”</p><p>In substance and tone, the appearance marked an even sharper-than-usual contrast with Mr. Trump, who began his day <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/trump-pa-rally-election.html" title="">declaring</a> that he “shouldn’t have left” the White House at the end of his term, intensified his unfounded claims of voter fraud and said “I don’t mind” if reporters are shot at.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Their appearances came as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/harris-trump-times-siena-poll.html" title="">polls show a close race</a> across the battleground states, including in Michigan.</p><p>The state is home to many Arab American and Muslim voters who are angered by the Biden-Harris administration’s support for Israel in the war in Gaza. Some have said they plan to vote third-party — and in some cases, for Mr. Trump — in response, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/michigan-harris-arab-muslim-jewish-voters.html" title="">significant political risk</a> for Ms. Harris in a closely divided state.</p><p>On Sunday, Ms. Harris opened her remarks by acknowledging the pain of the wars in Gaza and Lebanon . Her message was aimed not only at the state’s Arab American population but also at the younger voters more broadly who have expressed anger at the war.</p><p>“This year has been difficult given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza, and given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon,” she said. “It is devastating, and as president, I will do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza.”</p><p>As she typically does, Ms. Harris urged the return of the hostages who were taken from Israel during the Hamas-led attacks last October, and emphasized her commitment to security for both Israelis and Palestinians.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Even though she did not directly name Mr. Trump, Ms. Harris made it clear that she was running against him. At one point, she remarked that she did not believe “people who disagree with me are the enemy,” a reference to the former president suggesting that those who disagree with him constitute an “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/politics/trump-opponents-enemy-within.html" title="">enemy from within</a>.” At another point, she mentioned “those certain individuals who still want to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/us/politics/trump-biden-affordable-care-act.html" title="">get rid of the Affordable Care Act</a>” before leading the crowd in a chant of “we’re not going back,” one of her campaign slogans. (Mr. Trump repeatedly tried to repeal Obamacare as president.)</p><p>On Monday, Ms. Harris will visit Pennsylvania, a battleground state that could tip the election, for her last rallies of the campaign. She plans to appear in Allentown, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, where she will be joined by celebrity speakers and musicians including Oprah Winfrey, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Fat Joe, Ricky Martin and the Roots. She is scheduled to spend election night at her alma mater, Howard University, in Washington, D.C.</p><p>But on Sunday, she was addressing Michigan one last time.</p><p>“Michigan, two days to go!” she said. This, she added, is “one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and we have momentum, it is on our side. Can you feel it?”</p><p>The crowd roared in response.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicholas Nehamas is a Times political reporter covering the presidential campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-nehamas">More about Nicholas Nehamas</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
