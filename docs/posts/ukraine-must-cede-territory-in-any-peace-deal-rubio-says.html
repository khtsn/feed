    <h1>Ukraine Must Cede Territory in Any Peace Deal, Rubio Says</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“I think both sides need to come to an understanding that there’s no military solution to this situation,” Mr. Rubio said. “The Russians can’t conquer all of Ukraine, and obviously it’ll be very difficult for Ukraine in any reasonable time period to sort of force the Russians back all the way to where they were in 2014.”</p><p>Mr. Rubio added that it would be imperative in future talks with Moscow to determine what Russia was willing to concede.</p><p>“We don’t know how far apart they truly are,” Mr. Rubio said.</p><p>The talks on Tuesday likely will not delve into the proposed agreement on Ukrainian natural resources that Mr. Trump had described as compensation for U.S. military support during the three years since Russia’s full-scale invasion. He has said that an American financial interest in Ukrainian fossil fuels and rare-earth minerals would provide Ukraine with implied security.</p><p>Although the United States has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/cia-director-ukraine-intelligence.html" title="">stopped sharing some intelligence</a> with Ukraine, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/us-ukraine-satellite-imagery.html" title="">satellite imagery</a>, Mr. Rubio said it was still providing Kyiv with information that allowed it to continue defending itself against Russian attacks. He also said that there had never been a threat of removing Ukraine’s access to Starlink, the internet service company owned by Elon Musk’s SpaceX.</p><p>Even as the United States has been pressuring Ukraine in recent weeks, Mr. Trump has also threatened to impose additional sanctions on Russia in response to Moscow’s continued military activity. Mr. Rubio said that the United States was trying to demonstrate that it still had ways to coerce Russia in an effort to bring it to the negotiating table with Ukraine.</p></div></div>
