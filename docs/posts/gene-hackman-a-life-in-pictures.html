    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Gene Hackman, a celebrated actor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/obituaries/gene-hackman-dead.html" title="">whose death at 95 was announced on Thursday</a>, stood out in Hollywood for his ability not to stand out.</p><p>Not until he was 42 did he make his star turn, winning the Oscar for best actor for playing a gruff narcotics detective in “The French Connection.” But at that point he already had more than 30 television and film credits and a reputation for charming intensity that would stay with him throughout his career.</p><p>A tall man with thinning hair and a deep voice that was befitting a former Marine, he is easily remembered for distinctive mustaches and tweed jackets. Yet he was equally convincing in roles as a paranoid communications expert, an archnemesis of a superhero, a big-hearted basketball coach, a sinister sheriff and an eccentric patriarch of a family of troubled geniuses.</p><p>And if he seemed to some to have appeared out of nowhere in the 1970s as a fully formed star, he disappeared just as abruptly, doing one final film in 2004 and then walking away without any formal declaration that he had retired. He spent his remaining years in Santa Fe, N.M., painting and sculpting and staying out of the spotlight.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>He was Hollywood’s Everyman, but had a career — and a life — that few could even attempt to recreate.</p></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Everett Collection</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Hackman made an impression on Warren Beatty in 1964 despite a small part in the film “Lilith.” Mr. Beatty subsequently brought Mr. Hackman along for “Bonnie and Clyde” (1967), in which he managed to thrive in a cast that included, from left, Estelle Parsons, Mr. Beatty, Faye Dunaway and Michael J. Pollard. The performance earned Mr. Hackman an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-4"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Stanley Bielecki Movie Collection, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Hackman played Jimmy Doyle, a detective nicknamed Popeye who was not particularly concerned with the rules, in “The French Connection” — for which he won the Academy Award for best actor — and in “The French Connection 2.” In The New York Times’s review of the sequel, Vincent Canby said <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1975/05/19/76366007.html?zoom=15.85&amp;pageNumber=24" title="">of Mr. Hackman’s character</a>, “Popeye hasn’t gone soft or genteel in ‘French Connection II.’ If anything, he appears to have become a bit more of a magnificent boor.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-5"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Hackman celebrating his first Oscar, for best actor, for “The French Connection,” which won best picture; alongside Jane Fonda, who won best actress for “Klute,” in 1972.

In The New York Times, Mr. Canby, the film critic, <a href="https://nyti.ms/4kf6ybp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described an action sequence</a> and then added: “Shortly after this big scene, you stop worrying about acting and writing and logic and probability. You simply enjoy the engineering feats of the moviemakers, which are so effective that they touch even outrageous things with credibility.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-10"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Silver Screen Collection, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>In 1975, Mr. Hackman starred in Richard Brooks’s entirely forgettable “Bite the Bullet” alongside James Coburn. The film was panned by critics — a <a href="https://nyti.ms/4bmDkDh" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">headline in The New York Times</a> read “ ‘Bite the Bullet’ Is a Richard Brooks Error” — but featured a top-tier mustache from Mr. Hackman.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-11"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Hackman’s career saw him cross paths with numerous stars, including Liza Minnelli, who was his co-star in “Lucky Lady” (1975).</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-13"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ron Galella Collection, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Hackman was unforgettable as Lex Luthor in the “Superman” films, and he attended the premiere of the first installment in 1978 with his children.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-14"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Brennan/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Hackman, pictured here in 1980, was known for his gruff demeanor, though that only made the occasional smile look even larger.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-15"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bob Self/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Hackman had a brief stint in professional auto racing in the 1980s, competing in a few events, but ultimately decided he wasn’t a fit for the sport. “I think that, to be really good, you have to be extremely selfish, which is probably true in a lot of professions, including acting,” <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-03-13-tm-1434-story.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he told The Los Angeles Times</a>. “So I could maybe fulfill that part of it.

Mr. Hackman’s performance was the penultimate of his career.

He stood out in an ensemble cast that included Anjelica Huston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson and Bill Murray. Mr. Hackman’s antics with his grandsons showed a playful side that was sometimes missing from his earlier films. He also delivered showstopping lines like: “Hell of a damn grave. Wish it were mine.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Benjamin Hoffman is a senior editor who writes, assigns and edits stories primarily on the intersection between sports, lifestyle and culture.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
