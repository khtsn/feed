But while it’s relatively easy to plan a vacation abroad, planning a permanent move is often complicated, protracted and uncertain.</p><p>Generally speaking, most people live abroad because of a job or remote work, school, a path to residency or citizenship through a relative, or personal wealth. Absent those scenarios, an American’s access to a new life in a different country narrows considerably.</p><p>Even those who do have the means to live abroad often face hurdles. A cottage industry of lawyers, accountants, coaches, health insurance experts and real estate agents can, for the right fee, help you decide where to go, how to get there, and how to navigate confusing residency rules. In recent years, top destinations for Americans include Mexico, Canada and Britain.</p><p>“It’s just a project, and you have to work through the steps like any project, but it is doable,” said Jen Barnett, a founder of Expatsi, a company that helps Americans figure out how to move abroad.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here’s a guide on how to move abroad as an American:</p><h2 id="link-2078f2ed">Choosing Where to Go</h2><p>Stroll the cobblestone streets of a picturesque seaside village and it’s easy to imagine a life stripped of the grind and responsibilities of home. But living in a place is far different than vacationing in one, and immigration rules vary tremendously.</p><p>First, do your homework.</p><p>Study the culture, customs and climate of a region. Figure out the cost of living and the exchange rate to better understand how far your dollars will go and what your daily life might look like. Learn the language, if you don’t already speak it (or at least, start taking conversational classes and arrange to continue your studies locally). Join local social media groups for Americans already living in the country. Read up on the country’s history, government, politics and culture.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-3"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Do a trial run by planning an extended stay, if you can — Americans can visit Europe as tourists for three months and Mexico for six.</p><p>“Meet the locals,” said Doris Speer, the president of AARO, a nonpartisan association for Americans living outside the country, which estimates that 5.4 million Americans live abroad, not including military families. “Go there and see how you feel.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-4ba8dfd3">A Question of Time and Money</h2><p>Just how long the process takes and how much it costs will depend on your destination and your personal situation. It could take months, or even years, to dig up all the necessary documents and complete the bureaucratic steps to prove that your lineage correctly connects you to, say, Italy, to meet the country’s criteria for citizenship by descent.</p><p>For a few thousand dollars, an immigration lawyer can advise you about how to qualify for a long-stay visa or residency in a specific country and help you navigate the process. Consult a tax attorney and an accountant, since Americans living abroad can never escape filing federal income taxes back home as long as they retain their citizenship, even if they never set foot on U.S. soil and never work for an American company.</p><p>Factor in moving expenses, too. You will either need to pay to ship your possessions around the world or you will need to buy new ones once you arrive.</p><h2 id="link-875a1f">A Ticket Through Work or School</h2><p>If you are itching to travel and work for a company with international offices, you may be able to apply for a transfer, and your employer could help you navigate the process. (Even in that scenario, brace yourself for speed bumps that could cause delays.)</p><p>You could look for a job in another country while still in the United States, and get sponsored by that employer. Several countries, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand, recruit highly skilled workers. Depending on your line of work, you might need to transfer or update professional credentials or licenses, which can take time, involve tests or even more training.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Digital nomad visas, and similar ones, are available in dozens of countries including Ecuador, Spain and Croatia. These longer-stay visas are designed for remote workers who earn their income outside the country. In some cases, you can apply online for a minimal fee. Be prepared to show supporting documents like bank statements, proof of income, health insurance and proof of remote employment.</p><p>If you are considering going back to school for an undergraduate or advanced degree, look for programs in another country and live abroad on a student visa.</p><h2 id="link-75be0f52">Consider Your Heritage</h2><p>Some countries offer citizenship by descent. The rules change from one country to the next, and can be nuanced and confusing. To prove your familial ties to a parent, grandparent or great-grandparent, prepare to find birth certificates, marriage certificates and immigration papers for yourself and your ancestors.</p><h2 id="link-7caccf8b">Tap Your Nest Egg</h2><p>Money helps. Many countries like France, Mexico and Panama offer long-term residency to foreigners who can show they have enough savings or pension income to support themselves independently. While several <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/21/business/golden-visa-spain-europe-housing-crisis.html" title="">countries</a> have recently ended or scaled back their golden visa programs, there are still countries where you buy real estate — Malta, Greece and Malaysia, to name a few — to gain residency and, in some cases, a path to citizenship.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ronda Kaysen, a real estate reporter for The Times, writes about the intersection of housing and society.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ronda-kaysen">More about Ronda Kaysen</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/09/06/realestate/moving-abroad-americans-guide.html">84</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>When One Partner Is Deported:</strong> American citizens whose spouses have been deported <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/us/immigration-deported-spouses.html">face wrenching decisions on what is best</a> for their future, especially when they have children.</p></li><li><p><strong>Asylum Restrictions:</strong> The Biden administration is considering actions that would make the president’s tough but temporary <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/us/politics/biden-asylum-restrictions.html">asylum restrictions almost impossible to lift</a>, essentially turning what had been a short-term fix into a central feature of the asylum system in America.</p></li><li><p><strong>Immigration Divides a Town: </strong>Jobs attracted thousands of Haitians to Springfield, Ohio, and employers were ecstatic. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/us/springfield-ohio-school-bus-crash-haiti-immigrants.html">But a fatal bus crash touched off resentment</a>, and JD Vance entered the fray.</p></li><li><p><strong>Undocumented Spouses:</strong> A judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/us/undocumented-spouses-biden-administration.html">paused a Biden administration program</a> that could offer a path to citizenship to undocumented immigrants who are married to U.S. citizens, ruling in favor of 16 Republican-led states.</p></li><li><p><strong>Texas Stopped Busing in June: </strong>Gov.
