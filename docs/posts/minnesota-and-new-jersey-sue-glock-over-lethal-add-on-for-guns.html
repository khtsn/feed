They pose a growing risk to outgunned law enforcement officials and bystanders hit by the indiscriminate spray of bullets, a telltale sign of a pistol equipped with a switch.</p><p>The two suits — part of an aggressive push by Democratic attorneys general and gun control groups against manufacturers — claim that the company’s leaders have known for decades that two significant design characteristics of the weapon make it susceptible to conversion to a machine gun.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Not only have they rebuffed efforts of law enforcement officials to make the gun more difficult to alter, they have marketed it as customizable, according to the lawsuits, which were brought in conjunction with the national gun control group Giffords.</p><p>“Glock knows that its semiautomatic handguns are easily and frequently converted to illegal, fully automatic machine guns with Glock switches, and Glock knows that these fully automatic handguns present a significant threat to public safety,” the attorney general of Minnesota, Keith Ellison, wrote in a suit filed in state court in Minneapolis.</p><p>A representative for Glock did immediately return a request for comment.</p><p>Glock is a dominant player in the American handgun market, accounting for an estimated <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/denizcam/2018/11/19/the-billionaire-who-got-rich-off-glock-pistols/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two-thirds of all pistol sales</a> in the United States in any given year.</p><p>The company is by far the <a href="https://everytownresearch.org/report/city-level-data-crime-gun-recoveries/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">leading manufacturer</a> of handguns used in crimes across the country, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives as part of a 2023 gun trafficking report whose release was opposed by gun rights groups.</p><p>Glock pistols have accounted for nearly all converted automatic weapons recovered by the police in recent years: 643 of 706 converted semiautomatics seized by the authorities in Chicago since 2018 bore the company’s imprint, according to data cited in the Minnesota filing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The A.T.F. determined in 1981 that a weapon equipped with an auto sear was, in the legal sense, a machine gun. An owner must obtain a special license and pay fees to own an automatic weapon or face up to 10 years in federal prison.</p><p>The Supreme Court is expected to rule by June whether Mexico can sue firearms manufacturers like Glock over what the country describes as negligent and unlawful business practices that have allowed thousands of weapons to be smuggled across the border, arming powerful drug gangs.</p><p>Gun manufacturers claim the suit has no merit and is an attempt to impose gun control measures that Congress has blocked.</p><p>The Minnesota lawsuit accuses Glock of violating the state’s consumer protection laws by engaging in deceptive trade practices and making false advertising claims. The New Jersey lawsuit, filed simultaneously, uses a new public nuisance law that gives officials broad authority to pursue cases related to public safety and health.</p><p>“You have kids using these things — a kid fires a Glock with a switch at Newark housing projects, shoots 28 or 29 rounds, and just over a second, hits three people,” Matthew J. Platkin, the attorney general of New Jersey and a Democrat, said in an interview before the suit was filed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“We’ve got them being picked up off violent offenders, people accused of domestic violence,&#34; he added. “And these shooters are spraying bullets all over the place because they don’t know how to actually handle a machine gun. It’s ridiculous.”</p><p>In preparing the Minnesota lawsuit, investigators working for Mr. Ellison came across a startling and previously unreported episode from nearly four decades ago that they said decisively showed the company had long known its guns could be easily converted into automatic weapons.</p><p>During a trip to Venezuela in 1987, Gaston Glock, the company’s founder and a firearms designer, met with a local engineer and gunsmith named Jorge Leon. Mr. Leon demonstrated a “fire selector system” for use on the Glock 17 semiautomatic that shared many of the characteristics with modern switches.</p><p>Mr. Glock, as it turned out, had already developed a similar device. During a visit to a local gun range, he “quickly attached a small auto-sear device that he had in his pocket to the back of the pistol” and “proceeded to demonstrate fully automatic fire using the same gun,” according to an interview with Mr. Leon cited in the Minnesota lawsuit.</p><p>Mr. Glock, who died last year at age 94, did not, however, urge Mr. Leon to continue his own efforts. He urged him to scrap them and “leave it as a curiosity,” Mr. Leon told investigators.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Over the past three decades, Republicans, often at the behest of the National Rifle Association and trade groups, have passed laws restricting product liability lawsuits — a protection not afforded to other industries. As a result, gun control groups have sought to find creative ways around the restrictions through state laws.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/15/nyregion/sandy-hook-families-settlement.html" title="">In a landmark settlement</a> in 2022, Remington agreed to pay the families of nine Sandy Hook school shooting victims $73 million under Connecticut’s consumer protection laws.</p><p>Adam Skaggs, the chief counsel for Giffords’ litigation arm, said the two lawsuits filed on Thursday were also modeled on the multistate suits filed against opioid manufacturers and distributors. He said he expected the effort to ramp up after President-elect Donald J. Trump rolled back reforms enacted during the Biden administration.</p><p>“We’re pulling together to focus on industry accountability, to focus on really irresponsible and reckless actors in the gun industry,” Mr. Skaggs said. “The election of Trump makes it even more critical.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Glenn Thrush covers the Department of Justice and has also written about gun violence, civil rights and conditions in the country’s jails and prisons.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush">More about Glenn Thrush</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Gun Violence in America</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The True Costs of America’s Gun Obsession: </strong>Living in a country with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/briefing/america-guns-crime-border.html">highest rates of civilian gun ownership</a> has other, less direct consequences, too.
