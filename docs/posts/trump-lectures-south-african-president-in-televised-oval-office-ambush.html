Boer means farmer in Dutch and Afrikaans. The governing party of South Africa, however, the African National Congress, distanced itself from the chant, which was popularized by the leader of another political party, years ago.</p><p>“We have a multiparty democracy in South Africa that allows people to express themselves,” Mr. Ramaphosa told Mr. Trump. “Our government policy is completely against what he was saying.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>By the end, with the stunned South African president looking on, Mr. Trump began flipping through his printouts repeating, “Death, death, death.”</p><p>There have been killings of white South Africans, but police statistics show they are not killed at a higher rate than other South Africans. And while the South African government did pass a law permitting the government to take land without compensation, the process is subject to judicial review.</p><p>The South African delegation continued to try to explain to Trump the situation on the ground in South Africa, but he remained unmoved. “Dead white people, dead white farmers,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Trump narrated one of the scenes, which he said were “burial sites of more than 1,000 white farmers” whose loved ones cars lined up on Sunday mornings to visit their graves. “It’s a terrible sight,” he said. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”</p><p>Mr. Ramaphosa turned to look at the screen as Mr. Trump narrated, and then questioned the location of the scenes in the video, saying he didn’t recognize them as in South Africa.</p><p>Zolan Kanno-Youngs<!-- --> and <!-- -->Edward Wong<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Erica L.
