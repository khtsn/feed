It said that some people had been hospitalized but did not say how many.</p><p>Mark Kapczynski, 54, who lives in Sherman Oaks, Calif., and runs a business consulting firm, said he attended the event with his wife after buying two V.I.P. tickets for close to $350 each. General tickets <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DA6jaAjzbRm/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cost $159</a>.</p><p>He said that about 30 to 45 minutes after he sampled some of the food — including two plates of raw oysters and clams — he went outside for a drink and began “feeling bloated.”</p><p>The next day, he said, as he was taking an Uber home after a work event, he started feeling seriously ill and could “barely keep it together and not throw up and pass out.”</p><p>“I could barely walk into my house and, the next thing I knew, I’m in the bathroom every 40 minutes for about eight times all night, obviously throwing up and so on,” he said. “It was the most painful cramps I could imagine.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Kapczynski, who also had chills, ended up missing several days of work, he said. His wife, who ate one oyster, also got sick, he said.</p><p>“It was a disaster,” he said. “These are the top restaurants in L.A. You think you’re safe. Not what you expect.”</p><p>Mr. Kapczynski also spoke about his experience with <a href="https://lataco.com/la-times-101-restaurants-illness-oysters" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">L.A. TACO</a>, a local food-oriented news outlet, which reported on the outbreak.</p><p>Javier Cabral, the editor-in-chief of L.A. TACO, also attended and got sick. He said there had been a “very jovial vibe,” at the party, as chefs, writers and others from the city’s food scene mingled over small plates of Wagyu beef, ceviche and tacos. Two days later, he said, he felt seriously ill.</p><p>“Two little oysters brought me down in a way that made me honestly a little scared,” he said. “I vomited at least two dozen times.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Hillary Manning, a spokeswoman for The L.A. Times, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.</p><p>She told L.A. TACO that the oysters served at the event “were sourced by Santa Monica Seafood, a sponsor and the seafood vendor of the event.”</p><p>The oysters were “provided to one of the featured restaurants to serve,” Ms. Manning said.</p><p>She added that the Health Department had “inspected the restaurant’s storage and handling of the oysters, and the food safety protocols and standards at the event, and found that both the restaurant and the producers of the event met and exceeded all food safety requirements.”</p><p>Santa Monica Seafood said the oysters linked to the outbreak had been sourced by another seafood company, which voluntarily withdrew the product last week.</p><p>“There is no evidence to suggest mishandling at any point in the supply chain, including by Santa Monica Seafood or any of the restaurants participating in the L.A. Times event,” the company said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The county Health Department said that the outbreak at the restaurant event was linked to a broader outbreak from oysters that have since been recalled. The recall covered Fanny Bay Select oysters and Fanny Bay XS oysters from Pacific Northwest Shellfish Co., with a pack date of Nov. 25, 2024 or later, the department said.</p><p>Leigh Loader, the owner of Pacific Northwest Shellfish Co., based in Richmond, British Columbia, said the company had sent out recall notices and had stopped shipping oysters in the first week of December when it learned of issues with the product.</p><p>“We are very diligent — the whole industry here,” he said. He added: “Nothing will be reopened until the government here is more than happy that there is no chance of further illnesses.”</p><p>On Monday, the Food and Drug Administration advised restaurants and retailers <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/fda-advises-restaurants-and-retailers-not-serve-or-sell-and-consumers-not-eat-certain-oysters-and" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not to serve or sell</a> certain oysters and manila clams from Pickering Passage, in Washington State, warning that they were potentially contaminated with norovirus. On Wednesday, the agency <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/fda-advises-restaurants-and-retailers-not-serve-or-sell-and-consumers-not-eat-certain-oysters-2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued a similar advisory</a> warning businesses not to sell or serve certain oysters from parts of British Columbia.</p><p>Norovirus, which is highly contagious, can come from untreated sewage that accumulates in filter feeders like oysters and clams. Food containing norovirus may look, smell, and taste normal. Cooking shellfish can kill the virus. But oysters are often served raw.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In the United States, norovirus illnesses from oysters are “relatively rare,” according to Lee-Ann Jaykus, a food safety expert and professor emerita at North Carolina State University.</p><p>“That being said, aside from not eating raw molluscan shellfish, there is not much a consumer can do,” she said in an email. She added: “We have regulations for licensing oyster growing waters for harvest, to try to keep contaminated product out of the market, but they are not perfect.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
