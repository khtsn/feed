Ivan Morera isn’t used to being in last place. He’s a Green Beret. A relentless competitor. But at the 2024 Warrior Games, with his prosthetic hand hooked into a rowing machine, he was trailing the pack.</p><p>So he focused on increasing the rhythm of each pull: legs, body, arms. Arms, body, legs. When the buzzer sounded, he had passed everyone to win gold. “I do it to show my kids that everything and anything is possible,” said Sergeant Morera, who lost his left arm in a 2013 convoy accident in Afghanistan.</p><p>Hundreds of wounded or disabled troops competed alongside him at the U.S. military’s Warrior Games in Orlando, Fla., this summer, in events including archery, swimming, seated volleyball and wheelchair rugby.</p></div></div><div><p>Since the annual competition was created in 2010, the Games have given the Defense Department a new way to support and rehabilitate a select group of wounded troops, helping them remain in the service and on duty. The event has also become an important symbol of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/us/amputee-military-nurse-hannah-cvancara.html" title="">changing perceptions about who is fit to serve</a>.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hundreds of wounded or disabled troops competed at the Warrior Games in Orlando, Fla., this summer.

Military recruiters are also accepting more people with asthma, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and other previously disqualifying conditions.</p><p>The Warrior Games were designed to give some of those wounded service members a chance to be part of a team and work toward common goals, said David Paschal, assistant deputy chief of staff with the Army’s Training and Doctrine Command, which oversees the branch’s recruiting efforts. “I think those two things are critical to supporting the recovery of our athletes.”</p><p>The competition has also become a prime source of athletes for the U.S. team at the Paralympic Games, which kick off Wednesday in Paris. One of the most successful Paralympic swimmers, Sgt. First Class Elizabeth Marks, was injured as an Army medic in Iraq, which led to an amputation of her left leg several years later.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Sergeant Marks said Warrior Games athletes introduced her to adaptive sports during her initial recovery. “Swimming just became a place of peace for me,” <a href="https://www.stripes.com/branches/army/2021-07-21/olympics-paralympic-tokyo-army-soldiers-marks-swimmer-2220734.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she told the military publication</a> Stars and Stripes in 2021. “It was the one place where I got to create my own pain, and push my own body and not just have to exist in that pain.”</p><p>She has won five medals so far, including two golds, and will swim again in Paris.</p><p>About 200 athletes, some of whom might hope to make the next Paralympics, competed at the Warrior Games this year. Their disabilities include post-traumatic stress disorder, cancer, limb loss and traumatic brain injuries. About 70 percent of participants remain on active duty.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Each service branch, along with the Special Forces, sends about 40 athletes to the Warrior Games each year.

Athletes are drawn from the thousands of people in each branch’s “wounded warrior” program, who are given more time for medical appointments and additional access to specialists, though many say they still face long wait times and end up spending their own money for special care. About 40 competitors a year qualify for the Games from each service branch, with a separate delegation from Special Operations.</p></div><div><div><p>Giving injured service members another outlet for recovery is something the military has gotten better about in the more than two decades since the start of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Mr. Paschal said. Automatically discharging wounded troops who wanted to rehabilitate and continue to serve, he said, “was probably the worst thing we could have done.”</p><p>In past decades, for instance, Sergeant Morera’s amputation would potentially have meant leaving Special Operations, because he could no longer perform one of the staple skills of a paratrooper: opening both the primary and emergency chutes by hand. The cords are on separate sides of the body.</p><p>To allow him to continue to serve in the job he wanted, the Army created gear that lets him use his right hand for both chutes. The first time he landed after trying it, he said, “I took a knee and I cried, because I was like, ‘I’m a Green Beret again.’”</p><p>Not all troops are allowed to remain in the same roles after amputations or other serious injuries. But leaders can approve it if, like Sergeant Morera, accommodations allow them to do the job.</p><p>Similarly, the branches have reconfigured their regular physical fitness tests to give injured troops a better chance of passing. Alternatives to activities like running or pull-ups are now allowed, such as using equipment like rowing or elliptical machines.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Staff Sgt.

But the Pentagon has argued that some of the standards have become outdated as warfare has changed, and that more technologically advanced threats don’t require the same fighting methods as traditional conflicts.</p><p>Staff Sgt. Adam Proctor lost his left leg in a motorcycle accident in 2021. To stay in the Army, he chose the alternate rowing option for the fitness exam, instead of running two miles. He also completed the other requirements, and passed a separate exam specific to his job as a combat medic.</p><p>“Every task on the list for medics that they gave me to do, I added a 20-pound weight, went five minutes longer or 100 meters further,” he said. “I exceeded every standard. I didn’t want there to be any question about whether or not I could do all the tasks.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>In this year’s Warrior Games, Sergeant Proctor competed in track, seated volleyball and four other events. Training for the Games not only helped him stay in the Army, he said, but also gave him a reason to keep going during recovery.</p><p>“You don’t have anything to really drive you forward,” he said. “That becomes really hard.”</p><p>Tech. Sgt. Nicole Stickel, a radiologist, said training for weight lifting, cycling and track in the Warrior Games similarly helped give her the confidence to continue serving after she was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in 2022. She was almost dismissed from the Air Force, but her commanders supported her desire to stay.</p><p>After she made a technical error in a track relay event at the Games this summer, her coach reminded her that, at one point, she believed she would never be able to run again.</p><p>“I have come so far,” Sergeant Stickel said, adding, “The coaches really help bring that to light when you can’t see yourself.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
