He had grown up in a home without indoor plumbing, but now he was staying in lavish accommodations with about 180 other members of the Grambling College marching band.</p><p>Soon they would high-step onto the field at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to perform in the halftime show of the very first Super Bowl.</p><p>“When we heard that crowd, it was like a spirit got into us, and we were walking on a cloud,” said Colston, 77, who played the cymbals. “Our step was higher, and the beat was faster.”</p><p>In the decades before the National Football League recruited stars to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-halftime-show.html" title="">the rapper Kendrick Lamar</a> will headline on Feb. 9 at this year’s game in New Orleans — it frequently relied on dynamic marching bands from Grambling and other historically Black colleges and universities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jackson State’s band, known as “Sonic Boom of the South,” collaborated with Usher at halftime of last year’s Super Bowl. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">William H.

But there will be a presence at the Caesars Superdome when Southern University, from Baton Rouge, La., plays before Jon Batiste sings the national anthem.</p><p>Each H.B.C.U. marching band has its own style and look, with vibrant uniforms that often match the school colors. But no matter the school, spectators have come to expect a rollicking show with <a href="https://youtu.be/TTXA_10H2qc?si=pbrZ2HoVSmzDxvWI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">high-stepping choreography</a>, dancers often at the front, and trumpeters and drummers swaying in rhythm while blowing or pounding their instruments.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“That<strong> </strong>particular style of performance has always had broad appeal, and marching bands and other musical groups have always been cultural ambassadors for Black colleges,” said Steven Lewis, the curator of music and performing arts for the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington.</p><p>Grambling’s band of all-Black students was invited to Los Angeles at the height of the civil rights movement, and to a city still reeling from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/us/50-years-after-watts-riots-a-recovery-is-in-progress.html" title="">the flames and mayhem of the Watts riots</a> two years earlier.

In the 1960s, Colston said, 5 a.m. practices were not uncommon.</p><p>“They said, ‘We don’t turn down no performances,’” Colston said. “‘We’re going to go anywhere.’”</p><p>One day, Colston said, Jones gave a wad of cash to a drummer with instructions to dole out $2 to each band member for a spending allowance in Los Angeles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>When the musicians flowed onto the football field at halftime, Grambling <a href="https://youtu.be/7HKWfnDMohM?si=MGEeNZaIYkqMlBzI&amp;t=721" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joined the marching band</a> from the University of Arizona, a mostly white school, to depict a map of the United States. The bands played “This Is My Country” for the finale as a sea of balloons ascended.</p><p>“We had to conduct ourselves in a professional way because this was a group of colored kids in a white society,” Colston said. “We were representing our schools, our churches, the towns we came from.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At Super Bowl III in 1969, the year after the assassination of the Rev.
