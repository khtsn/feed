Canada is facing challenges that are unprecedented in our lifetimes.”</p><p>“The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades is changing,’’ he added. “Canada’s relationships with partners are also changing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Charles is Canada’s head of state and its monarch, but his speech was written by Mr. Carney’s office. It is only the third time that the monarch has opened Canada’s Parliament. Charles’ mother, Queen Elizabeth II, did it twice. </p><p>While the speech noted that Canada would attempt to negotiate a trade and security agreement with the United States, it also emphasized Mr. Carney’s pledge to find ways around the economic hold the United States has on Canada. The country’s economy is heavily dependent on exports to the United States, and both countries are each others’ largest trading partners.</p><p>“By staying true to Canadian values, Canada can buildnew alliances and a new economy that serves all Canadians,” said the king, who was making his first visit to Canada since he ascended to the throne.</p><p>“Canada is ready to build a coalition of like-minded countries,’’ he added, “that share its values, that believe in international cooperation and the free and open exchange of goods, services and ideas.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The trip by King Charles and Queen Camilla was fleeting, with the royal couple spending barely more than 24 hours in Canada. But the government laid on all of the pomp and ceremony at its disposal.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/27/multimedia/27canada-charles-bqpc/27canada-charles-bqpc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/27/multimedia/27canada-charles-bqpc/27canada-charles-bqpc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/27/multimedia/27canada-charles-bqpc/27canada-charles-bqpc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="King Charles and Queen Camilla riding in an open, horse-drawn coach, with two men wearing red uniforms sitting up front." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/27/multimedia/27canada-charles-bqpc/27canada-charles-bqpc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/27/multimedia/27canada-charles-bqpc/27canada-charles-bqpc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/27/multimedia/27canada-charles-bqpc/27canada-charles-bqpc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/27/multimedia/27canada-charles-bqpc/27canada-charles-bqpc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/f1201ba2-b96f-5200-9b2e-469adb74511a" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A horse-drawn coach brought King Charles and Queen Camilla to the Senate of Canada Building in Ottawa, on Tuesday, where the monarch spoke. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hannah Mckay/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Military bagpipers and drummers filled the air as the musicians marched outside the temporary home of the Senate, a former train station, where Charles spoke. The royal couple boarded a ceremonial horse drawn coach for a short trip to the Senate and they were escorted by 28 horses from a Royal Canadian Mounted Police squad.</p><p>At the Senate, the king and queen were greeted by a 100-member military honor guard whose members wore red dress uniforms and white pith helmets. Artillery boomed out a 21-gun salute. Later, fighter jets from the Royal Canadian Air Force streaked overhead.</p><p>Inside the Senate chamber, the mood was festive, particularly among the guests. Justin Trudeau, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/world/americas/trudeau-prime-minister-to-resign.html" title="">who resigned as prime minister this year</a>, paving the way for Mr. Carney to succeed him, was accompanied by his mother Margaret Trudeau. It was Mr. Trudeau’s first public appearance since he left office.</p><p>King Charles faces a delicate position when it comes to Mr. Trump. While he agreed to stand up for Canada’s sovereignty as its monarch, in his role as Britain’s king, he is also being used to woo the American president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In February, Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/world/europe/trump-starmer-king-charles.html" title="">delivered an embossed letter from Charles</a> to Mr. Trump, inviting him to make a rare second state visit to Britain.</p><p>Many of the previous visits by Charles to Canada, when he was the Prince of Wales, attracted limited interest among Canadians, particularly following his divorce from Princess Diana. But a large crowd appeared on Tuesday near the Senate and the National War Memorial where the royal couple placed a wreath before heading to the airport.</p><p>Among the few younger spectators were four people who had slipped away from work at a nearby office.</p><p>“In light of the U.S. administration and what’s going on, it feels good to support being Canadian and what that means,” said Laura Downey, 30.</p><p>As is the case with speeches that inaugurate Canada’s Parliament, the king’s address focused significantly on the legislative agenda for Mr. Carney’s new government, including boosting military spending, increasing housing and cutting government spending.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But toward the end, Charles subtly circled back to Canada’s current struggles with the Trump administration when he described the country’s national anthem.</p><p>“As the anthem reminds us: The True North is indeed strong and free!” the king said.</p><p>Mark Landler<!-- --> contributed reporting from London.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ian Austen reports on Canada for The Times based in Ottawa.
