In fact, the Nazis’ killing of almost six million Jews was meticulously planned and documented.</p><p>Mr. Cooper also called Winston Churchill, the British prime minister, “the chief villain of the Second World War” for declaring war on Germany after the Nazis invaded Poland.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Carlson’s promotion of Mr. Cooper <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/business/media/tucker-carlson-holocaust-interview-biden-administration.html" title="">drew criticism from the Biden White House and from some conservatives</a>.</p><p>A Vance campaign spokesman said this month that Mr. Vance did not share the views of Mr. Cooper <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/us/politics/jd-vance-tucker-carlson-darryl-cooper.html" title="">but “doesn’t believe in guilt-by-association cancel culture.</a>”</p><p>Mr. Vance has defended his decision to keep his interview with Mr. Carlson, saying that Republicans believe in free speech and debate. “Tucker Carlson is not affiliated with the campaign, so I don’t think what Tucker Carlson does is a distraction or is not,” Mr. Vance said this month. “He’s going to do what he wants to do, and we can disagree or agree with the viewpoints.”</p><p>Tickets for the events ranged from $35 for upper-level seats to $1,600 for a “V.I.P. Meet and Greet Experience” that included access to a reception with Mr. Vance, a photo with Mr. Carlson and a seat in the first five rows.</p><p>Mr. Carlson is in the midst of his first live tour, a national, monthlong run of shows with some of the most well-known and controversial figures in conservative politics. His guests have included Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point Action, and media personalities such as Glenn Beck and Dan Bongino.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Later this month, Mr. Carlson will be joined by Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist who has been ordered to pay over $1.4 billion in defamation damages to the families of the victims of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012; Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia; and Donald Trump Jr., the former president’s eldest child and the host of the podcast “Triggered.”</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael C.
