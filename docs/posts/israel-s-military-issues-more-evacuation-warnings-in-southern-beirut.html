    <h1>Israel’s Military Issues More Evacuation Warnings in Southern Beirut</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Israel’s military issued expanded, middle-of-the-night warnings to residents of Beirut’s southern suburbs to evacuate early Saturday, just hours after earlier orders were followed by a series of airstrikes.</p><p>The new warnings, issued at 3 a.m. local time on the social media site X, identified three additional buildings in south Beirut that the military said were related to the militant group Hezbollah, urging residents to get at least 500 meters away from them.</p><p>Earlier in the night, Israel’s military had pointed to three other buildings in the Dahiya, a densely packed civilian area near Beirut where Hezbollah holds sway. Soon after, explosions rocked the general area, lighting up the night sky with fiery flashes.</p><p>Those strikes were in addition to earlier blasts that Israel’s military said had targeted Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, believed to be in a leadership meeting in the group’s underground headquarters.</p></div></div>
