Soon after, explosions rocked the general area, lighting up the night sky with fiery flashes.</p><p>Those strikes were in addition to earlier blasts that Israel’s military said had targeted Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, believed to be in a leadership meeting in the group’s underground headquarters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/27/multimedia/27mideast-crisis-evacuations-jlgk/27mideast-crisis-evacuations-jlgk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/27/multimedia/27mideast-crisis-evacuations-jlgk/27mideast-crisis-evacuations-jlgk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/27/multimedia/27mideast-crisis-evacuations-jlgk/27mideast-crisis-evacuations-jlgk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A distant view of a city at night, with a bright explosion and billowing smoke on the horizon." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/27/multimedia/27mideast-crisis-evacuations-jlgk/27mideast-crisis-evacuations-jlgk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/27/multimedia/27mideast-crisis-evacuations-jlgk/27mideast-crisis-evacuations-jlgk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/27/multimedia/27mideast-crisis-evacuations-jlgk/27mideast-crisis-evacuations-jlgk-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/27/multimedia/27mideast-crisis-evacuations-jlgk/27mideast-crisis-evacuations-jlgk-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Smoke rising in neighborhoods to the south of Beirut after Israeli airstrikes overnight Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mohamed Azakir/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Some of the evacuation warnings were confusing, because the maps accompanying social media posts showed a much smaller area than the 500-meter radius specified by the military surrounding the buildings they said housed Hezbollah interests.</p><p>Earlier this week, the Israeli military sent out messages to Beirut radio stations and some cellphones, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/24/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah#israel-cellphones-text-alerts" title="">warning of coming attacks</a> in Arabic-language messages.
