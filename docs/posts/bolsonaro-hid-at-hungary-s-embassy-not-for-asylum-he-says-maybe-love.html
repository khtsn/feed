He asked the former president about it during <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-trump-us.html" title="">an interview</a> this week in Brasília.</p></div></div></div></div><p><time datetime="2025-01-17T05:03:12-05:00"><span>Jan. 17, 2025</span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>When we first watched the surveillance footage, we were stunned.</p><p>There was the Hungarian ambassador to Brazil pacing nervously in the embassy. There was Jair Bolsonaro, the former Brazilian president — fresh off court orders not to leave the country because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/world/americas/brazil-police-raid-bolsonaro-attempted-coup-investigation.html" title="">an intensifying criminal investigation</a> — arriving at the gate. There were the embassy staff members hustling to the guest quarters with linens and a coffee maker.</p><p>And then, for two days, there was Mr. Bolsonaro wandering the parking lot, looking bored, and there were his security guards fetching pizza.</p><p>Given the circumstances — a politician facing potential imprisonment sleeping at a foreign embassy controlled by a political ally — it had all the hallmarks of a man seeking political asylum. Foreign embassies can be considered sovereign territory and have historically been used as refuge for people fleeing custody.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Colleagues and I published an article saying so, complete with clips from the footage.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In response, Mr. Bolsonaro’s lawyers issued a statement saying he had merely gone to the embassy to talk politics. Any suggestion otherwise, they said, was “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/26/world/americas/bolsonaro-brazil-hungary-embassy.html" title="">fake news</a>.”</p><p>Alexandre de Moraes, the Brazilian Supreme Court justice leading <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/22/world/americas/bolsonaro-brazil-arrest-watches.html" title="">sprawling criminal investigations</a> into the former president, later decided that Mr. Bolsonaro <a href="https://noticias.stf.jus.br/postsnoticias/permanencia-de-bolsonaro-em-embaixada-da-hungria-nao-desrespeitou-medidas-cautelares-decide-stf/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had not broken the law</a> by sleeping at the embassy.</p><p>So when I sat down with Mr. Bolsonaro <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-trump-us.html" title="">for an interview this week</a>, I was eager to finally ask him why — in the middle of Brazil’s carnival, four days after the police confiscated his passport — he had decided to sleep in the small guest room of the Hungarian Embassy.</p><p>Here is an excerpt from our exchange, translated from Portuguese and edited for clarity.</p><p><strong>Why did you sleep at the Hungarian Embassy for two nights?</strong></p><p>Look, it was a question of time zones with whom I was talking. And that’s final.</p><p><strong>But you slept there for two nights?</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Yes.</p><p><strong>Is that normal?</strong></p><p>That’s up for me to decide.</p><p><strong>You don’t have a bed in Brasília? (Brasília is Brazil’s capital.)</strong></p><p>I do. I could’ve been fighting with my wife. I’m not saying. Just like when I talk to the authorities, I don’t say I did. Nothing leaks from me. Zero.</p><p><strong>Have you slept at another embassy?</strong></p><p>Who knows? I’m friends with Israel. I get along with countries in the Arab world. I’m not going to say what I do because that gives them a narrative to chase. I’m a free citizen.</p><p>The team of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/22/world/americas/brazil-alexandre-de-moraes.html" title="">Alexandre de Moraes</a> wanted to arrest me because I went without a passport. You don’t need a passport to enter an embassy.</p><p><strong>You are a private citizen. You’re also a former president who talks about the importance of the truth. So it’s natural to want to understand why you slept at a foreign embassy four days after the authorities searched your home.</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>They could have arrested me during the search if they wanted. Anything I do is an attempt to hide to them. Was it refuge? Asylum? With asylum, you deal directly with the president.</p><p><strong>Was it a bid for asylum? It seems strange to sleep in an embassy.</strong></p><p>Isn’t it strange that I’m being persecuted? Everything I might say, the other side could go after me. I met with [President Viktor Orban of Hungary] in Argentina at [President Javier] Milei’s inauguration. I get along well with him.</p><p>It wasn’t a crime what I did. If there had been any crime, they would have arrested me.</p><p>[The embassy’s surveillance footage also showed a person visit Mr. Bolsonaro for 38 minutes. A Brazilian news outlet <a href="https://www.metropoles.com/colunas/igor-gadelha/bolsonaro-visita-hungria" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">later reported</a> it was his son, Carlos. Carlos was in the room with us.]</p><p><strong>Carlos, you visited your father, right? What happened?</strong></p><p><strong>Carlos Bolsonaro:</strong> I just talked to my father about …</p><p>[Lawyer in the room interrupts to request to talk off the record.]</p><p><strong>Jair Bolsonaro:</strong> Do you think I would have trouble leaving Brazil right now? No passport? Don’t a ton of illegal immigrants go to the United States? I’m an army captain. I’m used to the hardships out there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>OK. So why were you at the embassy?</strong></p><p>Who knows? Maybe I have a lover there.</p><p><strong>I’m not trying to be difficult, but I care about the truth, and you say you do, too. So I just want to understand.</strong></p><p>It’s a secret. Maybe one day you’ll find out.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jack Nicas is a foreign correspondent for The Times, covering the conflict in the Middle East from Jerusalem.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jack-nicas">More about Jack Nicas</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
