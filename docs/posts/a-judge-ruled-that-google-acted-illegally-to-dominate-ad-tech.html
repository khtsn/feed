Today, the judge sided with the government on two of its three accusations against Google, ruling that it held a monopoly on tools used by publishers to host ad space and on the software used to facilitate online-ad transactions.</p><p>Next, the Trump administration will assess the ruling to determine whether to push Google, a $1.88 trillion company, to break apart its ad tech business. The tech giant has currently an 87 percent market share in ad-selling technology, according to the government.</p><p>It is the second time in a year that a U.S. court has found Google to have illegally maintained a monopoly. A judge in Washington, D.C., is now considering a request by the Justice Department to break the company up because of its dominance in online search.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump met with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy at the White House. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-1db55fc2">Trump promised to make a tariff deal with the E.U.</h2><p>During a White House meeting today with Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, President Trump said he was “100 percent” confident that the U.S. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/us/politics/meloni-trump-tariffs.html" title="">would strike a trade deal with the E.U.</a> before the end of his 90-day pause on some tariffs.</p><p>Trump also said today that he expected to make a trade deal with China, though it was not clear that any progress had been made.
