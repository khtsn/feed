Mr. Abedini was arrested, also on Monday, in Italy by Italian authorities at the request of the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Iran has made serious advances in the design and production of military drones in recent years, and has stepped up its transfer to terrorist groups across the Middle East, including Hamas and Hezbollah.</p><p>Iran has used its drone program to build its global importance and increase weapons sales but has suffered setbacks in its confrontation with Israel. In April, Iran <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/world/middleeast/israel-iran-jets-missiles-strikes.html" title="">launched an attack</a> on Israel that largely failed. Israel intercepted most of the roughly 200 drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles.</p><p>Iran has also run into supply chain issues, a problem that it apparently was trying to solve — at least partly — by evading American laws.</p><p>Joshua S. Levy, the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, said at a news conference that F.B.I. explosive experts recovered the drone used in the attack and traced its sophisticated navigation equipment to Mr. Abedini’s company in Tehran.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The dignified transfer of the three Army Reserve members who were killed in the drone attack in January: Sgt.

Mr. Abedini, who lives in Iran, runs a company in Tehran and has deep connections to the Iranian government and the I.R.G.C.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Prosecutors said Mr. Sadeghi introduced Mr. Abedini to his employer. Mr. Abedini then established a front company in Switzerland that was used to buy American technologies and transfer them to Iran. The two men conspired to violate U.S. export laws from 2016 to 2024, prosecutors said.</p><p>Mr. Levy described a sophisticated scheme that went on for years before federal investigators uncovered it. Prosecutors said that in 2016, Mr. Sadeghi traveled to Iran to seek funding from the Iranian National Elites Foundation, a governmental organization, eventually developing a partnership with Mr. Abedini.</p><p>The attack that killed the three soldiers, members of the Army Reserve, happened on Jan. 28 at a remote logistics outpost in northeast Jordan called Tower 22, where the borders of Syria, Iraq and Jordan converge. The one-way attack drone hit near the outpost’s living quarters, causing injuries that ranged from minor cuts to brain trauma, a U.S. military official said.</p><p>Mr. Abedini was working with the arm of the Revolutionary Guards known as the Aerospace Force that relied on his company’s navigation system, according to the criminal complaint.</p><p>“These defendants are charged with supplying sensitive technology to an Iranian company that develops technology the I.R.G.C. uses in its one-way attack drones to commit acts of terror around the world,” said Matthew S. Axelrod, the assistant secretary for export enforcement at the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Goldman writes about the F.B.I. and national security.
