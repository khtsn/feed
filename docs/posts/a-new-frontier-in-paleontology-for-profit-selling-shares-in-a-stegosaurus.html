The sale could raise up to $13.75 million, according to an S.E.C. filing. The company describes the sale as an initial public offering, but the shares will only be sold through its app or on its website, not on a stock market.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Shareholders will hope for a payout on the dinosaur, nicknamed Steg, once it is sold privately or auctioned to the highest bidder in about a year, according to the company, which sells shares in alternative assets like <a href="https://rallyrd.com/collection/cars/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">designer cars</a>, <a href="https://rallyrd.com/collections/1967-andy-warhol-marilyn-monroe-signed-print/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expensive artwork</a>, <a href="https://rallyrd.com/collections/1957-topps-95-mickey-mantle-card/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">baseball cards</a> and a <a href="https://rallyrd.com/collections/1776-broadside-of-the-declaration-of-independence/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">copy of the Declaration of Independence</a>.</p><p>“We took a risk,” said Rob Petrozzo, Rally’s co-founder and chief product officer. “We feel there is enough upside for investors to see a return.”</p><p>The fossil market has been setting records in recent years, the most recent of which was the hedge fund billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin’s winning bid of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/arts/design/stegosaurus-auction-44-million.html" title="">$44.6 million</a> this summer at the auction of a fossilized stegosaurus. He later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/arts/most-expensive-stegosaurus-american-museum-of-natural-history.html" title="">arranged to loan</a> the skeleton to the American Museum of Natural History.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Investors will be offered shares in the fossil of the stegosaurus, nicknamed Steg.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Rally; Photo by Jack Dalten</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The stegosaurus being offered to retail investors was discovered a few months before Griffin’s purchase, but Rally executives sensed a shift in the market. The company said that it paid $2.25 million to reserve rights to the fossil and to fund the remainder of its excavation by Thomas Lindgren, who runs a company that sources specimens for institutions and private collectors.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Lindgren has worked in the fossil industry for over 40 years, including a long tenure as a consulting director of natural history at Bonhams auction house. During an interview, he described finding the stegosaurus remains alongside the bones of prehistoric sauropods and theropods.</p><p>“It wasn’t a perfect dinosaur laying there, but it was a pretty complete one,” Lindgren said, saying that his excavation had already unearthed about 67 percent of the bones that scientists would expect on a stegosaurus, and he expects to find more as the excavation continues.</p><p>Lindgren has partnered with Rally before, helping the company offer shares in a <a href="https://rallyrd.com/collections/the-triceratops-prorsus-skull/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">triceratops skull</a> and a <a href="https://rallyrd.com/collections/the-carcharocles-megalodon-jaw/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">megalodon jaw</a> to investors.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1812859/000181285924000013/rsei1apos.htm#_Toc181177772" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">S.E.C. filing</a>, the stegosaurus skeleton measures over 23 feet in length and stands nearly 7 feet tall with most of its spiky tail and most of its back plates preserved. The fossil includes the characteristic dark brown patina typical of fossils found in the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/dino/learn/nature/morrison-formation.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Morrison Formation</a> that helped preserve the stegosaurus, which is believed to have roamed the earth about 150 million years ago.</p><p>Lindgren and his business partner, Jeffrie Parker, found the dinosaur while excavating Bone Cabin Quarry about 55 miles outside of Laramie, Wyo., under a long-term lease their company has with the landowner. In 1897, scientists from the American Museum of Natural History <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/chattanooga-daily-times/115551566/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exhumed the remains</a> of another stegosaurus and other dinosaurs there, including allosaurus and apatosaurus. But museum officials <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-anaconda-standard/115551328/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">abandoned the site</a> in the early 1900s, when it appeared that the fossil quarry was depleted.</p><p>“The museum liked big bones,” said Lindgren, explaining why he’s still finding significant fossils at nearby dig sites. “If they didn’t realize what they had, they didn’t pick it up.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Lindgren and his colleagues said they would retain 80 percent ownership in the stegosaurus when it is offered to the public. The paleontologist is hoping that increased transparency in the excavation process will entice potential buyers.</p><p>Petrozzo said that he hoped that the unusual chance to invest in a dinosaur whose skeleton is still partially buried in the ground would expand on Rally’s typical clientele, which he described as “31-year-olds who have made a little money but aren’t necessarily millionaires.”</p><p>“Steg investors might include 18-year-olds who wanted a share, private equity managers or sizable institutions,” Petrozzo said. “You will get a mix of people — a lot of this is driven by popular culture.”</p><p>Erin Griffith<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zachary Small is a Times reporter writing about the art world’s relationship to money, politics and technology.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zachary-small">More about Zachary Small</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
