What remains is a disorienting miasma of fresh economic uncertainty.</p><p>Despite reams of campaign proposals, just how President-elect Donald J. Trump’s administration will handle policy decisions that are crucial to the global economy’s path — on trade, technology, climate, industrial policy and more — is still unclear.</p><p>Meanwhile, pre-election sources of instability keep spinning. War rumbles on in Ukraine. Escalating conflict in the Middle East could reignite a rise in food and energy prices. China, a vital engine of global growth, is trying to resuscitate its flattened economy. Many poor and middle-income countries face an unscalable wall of debt.</p><p>Increasing bouts of extreme weather continue to destroy crops, wreck cities and swell the flow of migrants from economically devastated regions. And advances in <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4375268" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">artificial intelligence</a> are poised to eliminate, create and reconfigure tens of millions of jobs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Then there is the hangover from the pandemic. Philip N. Jefferson, the vice chair of the Federal Reserve, has said policymakers are still trying to <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20231114a.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">understand</a> the economic aftereffects of this “once-in-a-century disturbance of worldwide consequence.”</p><p>Inflation, in particular, has become harder to predict in the pandemic’s aftermath as political and military tensions have risen, he noted.</p><p>The one certainty about such uncertainty is that it tends to be bad for the economy. Businesses are more wary of investing, expanding and hiring. Consumers are less eager to spend their savings. Lenders may be more worried about extending credit, and as a result will increase the costs of borrowing. And such broad uncertainty almost always foreshadows a <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/global-economy-hit-higher-uncertainty" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decline in output</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President-elect Donald Trump’s election night speech was broadcast from ABC’s studio in Times Square early Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Researchers have created several surrogate indicators for economic uncertainty. One of the most widely used is the <a href="https://www.policyuncertainty.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Economic Policy Uncertainty Index</a>, which tracks mentions in the media of the term “policy uncertainty.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>According to this index, uncertainty has been steadily rising in the United States since the 1990s.</p><p>Election years traditionally see an uptick. In American <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27961/w27961.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">presidential elections</a> that were polarized and closely fought, uncertainty rose 28 percent on average in November compared with other election years.</p><p>As for this election, it hit “all the alarm bells for extremely high levels of uncertainty,” said Nicholas Bloom, one of the creators of the index and a co-author of the election study.</p><p>“Trump is a one-man uncertainty machine,” Mr. Bloom said. He noted that even in 2016, when the <a href="https://www.policyuncertainty.com/media/EPU_BBD_Mar2016.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">index was created</a>, “all the uncertainty metrics surged after Trump’s election because he used to just kick out a lot of pretty radical policy ideas and no one was quite certain if they would happen.”</p><p>And the effect was <a href="https://worlduncertaintyindex.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">global</a>. Mexico, Canada, China, Taiwan and Europe all felt the impact, Mr. Bloom said, primarily because of Mr. Trump’s victory but also because of Britain’s decision several months earlier to withdraw from the European Union.</p><p>A second Trump term promises more of the same.</p><p>Mr. Bloom, who surveys hundreds of companies, said most were “holding their breath, and could continue to hold it through 2025 or even 2026,” delaying investment and hiring decisions depending on how quickly clear policy decisions are made.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Trump has proposed a raft of economic policies that sharply diverge from decades of American policy and trounce the rules of international commerce, including across-the-board <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/us/politics/farmers-trump-china-tariffs.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">tariffs</a> as high as 50 percent on all imports, with those on China reaching 200 percent.
