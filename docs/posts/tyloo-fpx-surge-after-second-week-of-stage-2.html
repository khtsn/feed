    <h1>TYLOO, FPX surge after second week of Stage 2</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		<p>The second week of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2499/vct-2025-china-stage-2" target="_blank">VCT China 2025 Stage 2</a> is done, with plenty of matches only making the regional playoff picture clearer. Bilibili and FPX only widened their leads atop their groups, while Wolves and TEC remained winless in Stage 2.</p>

<p>Here is a rundown of how all the matches went in week two:</p>



<p>There were two extra games this week in comparison to week one, meaning that TYLOO, All Gamers, Wolves, and Trace Esports all played two matches instead of the regular one. Some of those teams took advantage of it, like All Gamers getting their first regional VCT win since June 2024, and then there was Wolves, losing their third straight game without winning a map since <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025" target="_blank">their third-place finish at Masters Toronto</a>.</p>

<p>With Wolves and Nova remaining winless, there were three undefeated teams in Group Omega alone: FPX, Xi Lai Gaming, and Dragon Ranger Gaming, all at 2-0. The only undefeated team in Group Alpha is Bilibili Gaming, which has continued its regional dominance, easily being the contenders for the most consistent VCT China team so far. Their game against JDG was relatively one-sided aside from a clutch OT win from JDG on Ascent, where <span data-ref-id="12">

</span> dropped 35 kills on Yoru. </p>

<p>Coming back to All Gamers, who nearly won two matches after their regional drought. Their star performer on their ten-player roster was <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/46748/k1ra">
		K1ra	</a>
</span>, who played great on both Raze and Omen to sweep Wolves and put up a strong fight against DRG. He ended the Wolves series with a 1.59 match rating, and his performance on Corrode was that of a player who knew the map for years, not just weeks. Add onto that an amazing ace against DRG on Lotus, and he had a hell of a week.</p>

<p>Another amazing performance this week was <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/3028/life">
		Life	</a>
</span> from FPX, who showed off a Waylay masterclass on Ascent. Life ended the sweep with a 1.32 match rating, 58 kills, 280 ACS, and a lobby-leading 15 first kills. Lastly, <span data-ref-id="15">

		NoMan	</a>
</span> has been filling in great for XLG after their roster change heading into Masters Toronto, and was key in their win over Wolves.</p>

<p>However, none of those players was the star performer of the week. Instead, that belongs to <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/39485/scales">
		Scales	</a>
</span> from TYLOO, who led his team to two sweeps in a single week. First, in the matchup against Trace Esports, he ended the series with a 1.30 match rating, an impressive 56 percent headshot rate, and played well alongside his teammates to win against a strong regional opponent. Then, in their second game, Scales decided to flex onto Iso on Haven, and ended the series comfortably on top of the leaderboard with a 1.47 match rating, 37 kills, 274 ACS, 174 ADR, and 47 percent headshot rate to prove his game against Trace was replicable.</p>

<p>Due to scheduling, both weeks three and four will also have eight matches each. The week three matches for VCT China 2025 Stage 2 are:</p>
