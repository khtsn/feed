Another provision permits a one-time, automatic cancellation of up to $20,000 in accrued interest for borrowers regardless of income.</p><p>Borrowers with outstanding undergraduate debt that is at least 20 years old, or graduate debt that is 25 years old, would also see their balances automatically forgiven under the rule. And a smaller number of students who attended schools that closed or whose graduates did not find jobs in meaningful numbers would also see their debt canceled.</p><p>Judge J. Randal Hall, a federal judge for the Southern District of Georgia, said in granting the temporary restraining order that the states had established a likelihood that the Education Department had overstepped its authority, and could well prevail in the lawsuit.</p><p>“This is especially true in light of the recent rulings across the country striking down similar federal student loan forgiveness plans,” Judge Hall wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Like the temporary injunction placed on the SAVE plan, the order on Thursday prevents the Education Department from forging ahead with its student debt programs only while legal challenges play out in court.</p><p>But an energized collective of Republican attorneys general has steadily chipped away at the administration’s debt relief programs, arguing that they harm taxpayers by forcing the government to absorb the cost of outstanding loan and interest balances.</p><p>The states that sued to block the rule include Missouri, Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, North Dakota and Ohio. Larger coalitions also banded together to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/13/business/biden-save-student-loans-courts.html" title="">challenge the SAVE plan</a> in two separate cases, as well as the Biden administration’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/us/politics/biden-title-ix-transgender-students-schools.html" title="">revised Title XI rules</a>.</p><p>“This is a HUGE victory for every American who won’t have to pay someone else’s Ivy League debt,” Andrew Bailey, the Missouri attorney general, who has helped lead several challenges, wrote on social media.</p><p>The Education Department has repeatedly vowed to keep borrowers informed about the status of its programs <a href="https://www.ed.gov/save" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on its website</a> as legal challenges mount, leaving borrowers in limbo. While the order on Thursday did not directly affect anyone because the rule has not been finalized, more than eight million people who had enrolled in the SAVE plan await the outcome of that case for clarity on the amount of debt they still owe.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zach Montague is a Times reporter covering the U.S. Department of Education, the White House and federal courts.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague">More about Zach Montague</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
